U.S. District Court Judge J. Michael Seabright disqualified Essayli from supervising the criminal prosecutions in three cases, siding with defense lawyers. Essayli has been unlawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California since July 29, Seabright wrote. But he may continue to serve as a First Assistant United States Attorney, Seabright ruled, effectively leaving him as the office’s top prosecutor.

“Nothing is changing,” Essayli wrote in a social media post on Oct. 28, saying he looked forward to advancing President Donald Trump’s agenda.

The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration‘s effort to extend handpicked acting U.S. attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law. A judge ruled in September that acting U.S. attorney of Nevada, Sigal Chattah, was serving in her position illegally. Another judge disqualified acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, in August.

Essayli is a former federal prosecutor turned Republican California Assemblymember, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against California policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.

Under federal law, if a permanent U.S. attorney is not nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate within 120 days, judges of the federal district court can appoint an interim until the vacancy is filled. Essayli has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate — something that generally requires a degree of bipartisan support. California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla have criticized Essayli’s appointment.

Essayli was appointed as interim U.S. attorney in March, several months after former President Joe Biden’s appointee to the job resigned. Just shy of the 120-day mark, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him as first assistant U.S. attorney and said he would have the authority to serve as acting U.S. attorney upon a vacancy in the role. He then resigned as interim U.S. attorney.

The government has argued that he can do so under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which Congress passed specifically to regulate the temporary filling of executive branch vacancies that require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.

Seabright, however, said that provision of the law only applies if the previous U.S. Attorney dies, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated.

The lawsuit seeking to disqualify Essayli was brought by three men facing federal firearms charges. They sought to have their indictments dismissed. Seabright ruled the indictments can proceed.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/AP25281611539665-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-10-31 10:57:18.304144

What is the filibuster and why does Trump want to get rid of it?

Rachel Leingang

Donald Trump on Thursday suggested ending the filibuster to bring an end to the government shutdown, which has now passed one month with no signs of compromise on the horizon.

Both parties have previously defended or sought to dismantle the US Senate rule, depending on the moment and the contours of the debate.

“….BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the US president wrote on Truth Social.

Need a refresher on the filibuster and why it matters? My colleague Rachel Leingang has this explainer on what you need to know:

More than 40 million Americans will stop receiving food stamps on 1 November, as the US government shutdown enters its fifth week.

The Department of Agriculture says the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) will be suspended until Congress reopens the government. While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states have sued the government to force the program to continue.

Meanwhile, Democrats are also refusing to vote to end the shutdown because health insurance costs are set to go up dramatically as insurers prepare for a lapse in subsidies. Senate Democrats are demanding that any short-term government funding deal include an extension of the enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, while Trump and the Republicans have said they will not negotiate until the government is back up and running. Extending the subsidies would require $350bn in federal spending over the coming decade.

We’d like to hear from Americans who are about to lose Snap food assistance due to the shutdown, as well as from people whose healthcare may become unaffordable due to rising premiums. Have you received any notices or paperwork that your insurance will change soon? Tell us using the link below:

Neither agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins nor House speaker Mike Johnson commented on the issue Democrats have been holding the government closed in order to address: health insurance premiums that will double, triple or more for people using healthcare insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.

Instead, Johnson attributed the shutdown to a call for a “leftwing, radical agenda”.

Mike Johnson seeks to blame Democrats for Americans losing food benefits

US House speaker Mike Johnson spoke about millions of families suffering “because of Snap benefits drying up” during the government shutdown, while offering “a word of sincere gratitude” to millions of federal workers who have showed up without pay, “not knowing when or if their next paycheck will be delivered”.

“We just want to say thank you for your diligence … even though Democrats are withholding your paycheck. They are shameless in doing so.”

Johnson laid blame for the shutdown on Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats choosing not to approve a continuing resolution on funding the government. “The pain of the people is their political lever,” he said. “Republicans have done their part.”

Mike Johnson doubles down on refusing to bring back House until shutdown ends

US House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated this morning that he will not bring the chamber back into session until the government shutdown ends.

Speaking to Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “We are anxious to get the house back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have got to reopen the government. Again, it’s the most fundamental responsibility of congress is to have the government operate and work for the people. That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”

The government is on day 31 of shutdown today. The senate adjourned on Thursday without resolving demands by Democrats to negotiate on healthcare subsidies for insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The senate won’t meet again until Monday, extending the shutdown into at least its 34th day, equaling the longest in US history.

Meanwhile, health insurance exchanges enter an open enrollment period tomorrow. An early peek at prices without subsidies suggests that the cost of many plans will double or more. Paychecks for most government employees will not go out tomorrow. And the government will not pay Snap food benefits that would normally land on prepaid cards tomorrow, leaving about 42 million beneficiaries – mostly children and disabled elderly recipients – searching for ways to pay for food.

The president of the Heritage Foundation has denied the suggestion that the conservative thinktank should distance itself from former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, after interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who made antisemitic statements during the two-and-a-half hour video.

“Christians can critique the State of Israel without being anti-Semitic, and of course, anti-Semitism should be condemned,” said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, in a video on X yesterday. “[C]onservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”

Roberts said: “The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now. We don’t take direction from comments on X, though we are grateful for the robust free speech debate.”

House Republicans increasingly frustrated with Johnson over shutdown tactics

House Republicans are increasingly expressing frustration with the chamber’s moribund activity and the legislative backlog piling up as speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana keeps Congress out of session during the government shutdown.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia confronted speaker the speaker during a House GOP conference call to criticize his tactics to negotiate the shutdown, according to a piece in the Hill today.

Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas has also been critical of the shutdown’s effect on the legislative agenda, Axios reported.

Kennedy Center ticket sales for orchestra, dance and theatre performances are at the worst they have been since the pandemic, analysis by the Washington Post has found.

Back in September, the Guardian reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center had continued to plummet following Donald Trump’s takeover of Washington DC’s premier performing arts venue.

Since then typical ticket sales are down from 93 per cent in late 2024 to about 57% this year, according to the Post.

Audiences are “voting with their feet to skip out” on shows that would once have been packed, in protest at the US president inserting himself into the center’s management and operations as its new chair.

A federal judge has indicated that she would order the Trump administration to use reserves to partially fund food assistance for about 42 million Americans in November, reports the Washington Post. If the order goes ahead, it could delay a cutoff in benefits during the government shutdown.

US grocers and food companies ranging from Walmart to Smithfield Foods are bracing for a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits lapse for the first time due to the ongoing government shutdown.

The shutdown has imperiled next month’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, which serves nearly 42 million people.

Neither Congress nor the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acted to fund the benefits beyond Saturday. The gap could mean an $8bn revenue drop for grocers, declining sales for their suppliers and reduced hours for workers as it drives Snap recipients to reduce spending, trade groups, companies and a union said this week, reports Reuters.

Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of health, nutrition and food studies at New York University said:

It’s not only poor people who are on Snap who are going to be affected. It means the places where they spend the money aren’t going to get that money.

The National Grocers Association said on Wednesday that Congress should reopen the government and fund Snap to avoid instability for customers and retailers, warning of “serious consequences for local grocers, their employees, and the food supply chain.”

“Retailers are going to be in a terrible situation here trying to manage costs and inventory,” said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, adding stores could see unsold perishable goods go to waste.

A USDA spokesperson called the benefit lapse “an inflection point for Senate Democrats”. The agency has repeatedly blamed Democrats for the shutdown, most of whom have withheld votes on a spending bill in an attempt to keep healthcare costs from increasing for many Americans.

A US Republican senator is asking President Donald Trump’s administration to help the Malaysian government prevent US artificial intelligence chips from being smuggled through the country to China, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Reuters has previously reported that US officials believe Malaysia is among a handful of countries where organized smuggling operations have worked to get US chips into China that would otherwise be banned from export to China.

Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, wrote a letter to US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick saying Malaysian officials had begun cracking down on such activity and the Trump administration should aid Malaysian officials in the effort by helping the country develop screening programs to ensure chips are not being diverted to China.

Cotton, who along with the Trump administration has supported the idea of requiring US chips to contain technology that would verify their location to prevent smuggling, said chips with such technology should be given a green light for export to Malaysia, reports Reuters.

Cotton wrote in an 30 October letter:

As is often the case, US companies are at the forefront of developing creative and innovative technical solutions, which will help add layers of assurance against illegal diversion.

Cotton said:

To support the semiconductor industry in their efforts, it may be beneficial for US and Malaysian officials to develop priority customs clearance procedures for shipments of advanced U.S. chips with anti-diversion mechanisms.

Malaysia, China’s largest trading partner in Southeast Asia, announced in July it was requiring permits for all exports, trans-shipments and transits of US-made high-performance chips, such as those made by Nvidia.

UN human rights official says US strikes on alleged drug boats are 'unacceptable'

The UN high commissioner for human rights said on Friday that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.

Volker Türk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization, reports the Associated Press (AP).

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for Türk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular UN briefing:

These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.

She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law”.

President Donald Trump has Justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61, reports the AP.

Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. Shamdasani added:

Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.

The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.

US Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countries

Rachel Leingang

The US Senate took a stand against Donald Trump’s global tariffs affecting more than 100 countries on Thursday, voting to nullify the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.

Four Republicans joined with all Democrats to vote 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs that the president put into place via executive order.

It was the third time the Republicans have voted alongside Democrats on a tariff resolution this week, previously rallying to end tariffs targeting Brazil and Canada.

Going against Trump is rare for Republicans in his second term. But Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the opposition party.

The vote came as Trump is wrapping up a week in Asia, where he struck a deal with China to lower tariffs on Chinese goods into the country and get China to buy up US soya beans, a pain point of the trade wars that had farmers on edge, among other concessions.

Despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.

The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.

Kaine said:

I did learn in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior.

Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown

President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.

Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social:

THE CHOICE IS CLEAR – INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER.

The filibuster is a longstanding tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the 1 October shutdown when the new fiscal year began.

Trump’s call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional deal-making operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.

Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

In a separate post on Truth Social, Trump wrote about his meetings and said it “was a great honor” to “see that America is respected again”. He also claimed that “money is pouring into our Country because of Tariffs and, frankly, the Landslide Results of the 2024 Presidential Election”.

Switching back to the filibuster issue, Trump wrote:

It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!

More on this in a moment. First here are some other key developments:

A (small) handful of US Senate Republicans issued a legislative rebuke to president Donald Trump’s world-rattling trade tariffs in a rare alignment with their Democratic counterparts. Four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined the opposition party, voting 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs on more than 100 nations that the president put into place via executive order.

The Trump administration is going to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans. The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, on Thursday declared a state of emergency to free up funds so that she could issue $65m in assistance to food banks because federal funding for the national food stamp program is set to lapse on 1 November. Oregon and Virginia have also issued emergency declarations to release state cash to go towards emergency food assistance as the federal government shutdown imperils Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits for nearly 42 million Americans.

More than half of Americans disapprove of Trump’s demolition of the White House’s East Wing and the construction of a new ballroom, according to a new poll from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos. The survey was conducted between 24 and 28 October and indicates 56% of the respondents disagree with Trump’s recent move while 28% are in favor of it. Most of the survey’s respondents were white, one-third of them voted for Donald Trump and another third for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has urged the Trump administration to suspend its immigration crackdown in his state from Friday to Sunday, to allow children to “spend Halloween weekend without fear”.

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”

On Thursday, two immigrant advocacy groups were denied a requested temporary restraining order (TRO) that would have guaranteed attorney access to detainees brought up on deportation-related charges in, but then removed from, the Beaver State.

In a six-page opinion and order, U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken, a Bill Clinton appointee, said the plaintiffs did not yet make a clear enough showing that such alleged behavior by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents is unconstitutional.

""Plaintiffs allege that ICE obstructs and delays attorneys from meeting with their detained clients before it transfers their clients out of state,"" the judge explains. ""Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO is DENIED.""

The litigation was filed earlier this month by the Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based group of lawyers, activists, and tech professionals focused on immigration reform and upholding constitutional rights.

In a 35-page complaint and concomitant 21-page motion for a TRO, the plaintiffs allege various violations of the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the federal statute governing the behavior of administrative agencies like ICE.

""The U.S. Constitution requires that individuals subject to the government's unilateral power of detention, transfer, and extraordinary rendition must have the right to access counsel before any transfer or rendition,"" the lawsuit begins. ""Recent federal agency action, however, has undermined this sacrosanct safeguard.""

The complaint details the allegations:

[F]ederal agencies have commanded their vast resources and innumerable agents to assault the people—immigrants and non-immigrants alike. Undertaking the orders of the President ""to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,"" federal agencies—which are mere creatures of law with an ironclad obligation to always obey the law—have largely abandoned the law, especially the law on immigrant detention, and their constitutional, statutory, and regulatory obligations.

In this spirit, federal agencies have adopted officially sanctioned policies, patterns, and practices designed to achieve quota deportations at all costs—even if that means violating the right to access counsel that is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment…

In their request for emergency relief, the plaintiffs asked the court to ""immediately"" enter a TRO barring the government ""for three business days from transferring"" immigration detainees out of Oregon so as to give the detained individuals time to meet with counsel.

Painting a dire picture, the plaintiffs accused ICE of detaining ""citizen and immigrant"" alike in ""violent sweeps"" that then ""trap"" such detainees in the government's ""vast detention network: a network that spans from Tacoma, Washington, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Sudan to Libya to CECOT—a notorious torture center in El Salvador.""

The plaintiffs' Kafkaesque recitation of ICE activity recalls a flashpoint in the second Trump administration's immigration control campaigns, the use of so-called ""third-country"" deportation flights. In fact, the plaintiffs clearly allege they think this is happening to Oregonians.

""Individuals arrested in immigration enforcement actions may not only be rapidly transferred outside of Oregon and far from their communities of support, but they can also be sent quickly to third countries—like South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, or Libya—where they have never been before and where the government takes the position that they are beyond the reach of this Court's jurisdiction and ability to remedy any unlawful detention or transfer,"" the lawsuit goes on.

The government, in turn, said the plaintiffs were raising much ado about a very simple fact of ICE's operational capabilities.

""Plaintiffs' requested relief is overbroad, unworkable, potentially contrary to law, and otherwise improper,"" the 45-page opposition motion filed by the Department of Justice reads. ""As to the transfer prohibition in particular, ICE does not have any overnight detention facilities within Oregon. Any alien arrested in Oregon that ICE determines will remain in custody must be transferred out of state.""

To hear the DOJ tell it, ""[a]lmost all adult"" Oregon detainees are transferred to the ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington. Such detainees ""routinely"" access attorneys in ""several"" ways, the DOJ claims.

""The thrust of Plaintiffs' complaint is that detainees are not being given sufficient access to attorneys,"" the government's response reads. ""The way to remedy that harm would be to mandate increased access in some fashion. But there is absolutely no reason for the Court to restrict Defendants from detaining individuals in particular locations. Whether a detainee is held in Oregon or Washington does not impact his ability to interact with a lawyer; there is simply no connection between attorney access and whether an individual is transferred out of state.""

The DOJ also argued that ICE has ""clear statutory authority"" to make immigration-related arrests – even without a warrant – under two different prongs of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

And, for now, at least, the court sided with the government.

""At this preliminary stage, the Court finds that Plaintiffs declarations present evidence of Defendants' practices and policies that may violate a detainees' constitutional rights or conflict with Defendants' own rules and regulations,"" the brief bit of legal analysis supplied by the court reads. ""However, Defendants have presented evidence contradicting Plaintiffs' allegations and the testimony and evidence in the declarations does not show that the law would 'clearly favor' Plaintiffs.""

While giving a very terse explanation for her reasoning, the judge more or less suggests the plaintiffs have raised some general issues of constitutional concern while at the same time outright saying ""there is some doubt"" they are likely to succeed on the current set of facts. To that end, the court says the immigrant advocates need to show more – and at this moment have not shown enough.

""It may be that evidence from other witnesses, or the addition of a party is necessary to establish a more concrete connection between the injured party and the rights Plaintiffs seek to enforce,"" Aiken muses.

The judge gave the plaintiffs two weeks to file an improved motion for a TRO. The government will then have two weeks to respond. After that, the plaintiffs will have two weeks to reply to the government. A hearing on the next TRO request is slated for Dec. 12.",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Memorial-Day-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:57:22.262062

The difference between “Visa” versus “Status”

First things first: what is the difference between “visa” and “status?” The two terms are often used interchangeably.

Your visa is the foil or sticker placed in your passport by a U.S. consulate outside the U.S., granting you permission to travel to the U.S. and seek entry. You can find it inside your passport. See Figure 1 for details.

On the other hand, your immigration status (e.g., B-1/B-2, F-1, or H-1B) describes how long in the specific status you can lawfully remain in the U.S. Your immigration status is decided at the border, when you seek entry into the U.S., and is recorded on an I-94 (i.e., the Arrival/Departure Form), and you are able to seek an extension of your immigration status in the U.S. or change your status in the U.S.

Your visa can expire even if immigration status remains active. The reverse is also true: your immigration status can expire even if your visa remains active. In either case, you can face legal consequences — which means renewing your visa and respecting the rules of your immigration status is critical should you wish to remain in the U.S.

H-1B Visa Holders

There are an estimated 730,000 H-1B visa holders living in the U.S. Most of them are from Asian countries. In fact, Asian workers accounted for almost 90% of approved H-1B visa applications in 2024, with most applications coming from India (71%) and China (12%). However, recent changes could put the future of the H-1B program into question. Here’s what we know:

$100,000 fine on H-1B applicants and visa holders

The Trump White House announced a $100,000 fee for individuals filing first-time H-1B petitions on or after September 21, 2025, and who are not currently in the United States. This fee will not apply to those who submitted their H-1B petitions before September 21; those with a valid H-1B visa (travel in and out of the U.S. is still permitted); and those in H-1B status inside the U.S. who petition for amendment, change, or extension and are granted such amendment, change, or extension.

There is an exception to the $100,000 fee for individuals whose “presence in the United States as a H-1B worker is in the national interest” — but it’s up to the Department of Homeland Security to decide who satisfies this “high threshold.”

In short, the $100,000 fee targets H-1B applications from people who:

Are outside the U.S. and who do not hold a valid H-1B visa.

Are in the United States with a request for consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection.

Are in the United States with a request for amendment, change, or extension of H-1B status, and that request is denied.

What else you should know:

Petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment using pay.gov according to the instructions available here. Petitioners must complete payment prior to filing a petition with USCIS and will be required to submit proof of payment from pay.gov — or proof of an exception from the Secretary of Homeland Security — in order to complete the filing process. Without proof of payment or proof of an exception, petitions subject to the $100,000 fee will be denied. Talk to an immigration attorney if you have questions about the payment.

Trump has instructed the State Department to warn B-1 and B-2 visa holders against misusing their current status to avoid the $100,000 fine. We are still waiting for more specific guidance — but in the meantime, B-1 and B-2 visa holders who anticipate filing an H-1B application should consult legal counsel.

📝 The American Immigration Lawyers’ Association has a helpful fact sheet with even more information about the new fine.

Proposed changes to the H-1B lottery system

On September 24, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to replace the current H-1B lottery system for H-1B cap-subject petitions with a weighted selection process, prioritizing higher-paid foreign workers. Here’s what we know:

Under the new system, each H-1B petition will be assigned to one of four wage levels, and each wage level will be given a specific number of entries into the selection pool. As a result, high-wage earners (Level 4) will be four times as likely to receive an H-1B visa in comparison to low-wage earners (Level 1).

➡️ Where do you fit in? To make a determination, the Department of Labor will look at your occupation, position requirements, and geographic location.

Please note: This is just a proposal and it still has to go through a one-month commenting period before the Trump administration makes a final decision. This could take months.

What can we expect in the coming months?

Under the Trump administration, it appears that the future of the $100,000 H-1B fee will be decided in the courts. In recent days, a national coalition of labor unions and immigrant justice organizations filed the first legal challenge to Trump’s proclamation. Not long afterwards, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced a lawsuit of its own. Where does this leave immigrant workers? The answer is unclear, and it could take months before a final decision is reached.

International Students

For international students, the path forward is uncertain. Those who have lost their status are forced to transfer schools and leave the country. Those who have lost their visas are effectively trapped in the U.S. — unable to return home for weddings, funerals, or cultural holidays without giving up their studies.

What about federal litigation? Students and immigration advocates filed more than 100 legal challenges against the Trump administration in response to its SEVIS termination policy. Many of them are still in process. Others have granted at least temporary relief to affected students.

All of this appears to have made a difference. In April 2025, ICE declared that it will cease the terminations of SEVIS records. Just a few weeks later, a federal district court judge in the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, putting a stop to ICE’s arbitrary termination of the SEVIS records and calling for the restoration of all SEVIS records.

Continuous vetting and consular review

The Trump administration has also expanded screening and vetting for visa applicants. infrastructure for monitoring international students and other visa-holders.

The process is even more intensive for F-1 visa applicants. Starting on June 18, 2025, all FMJ applicants are expected to make their social media accounts public, to allow consular officers to review your entire online presence. Should you refuse, officials could reject your visa application on the grounds of “evasiveness.”

Other important considerations

Trump’s travel ban on 19 countries — including four Asian and Pacific Island nations — restricts people from around the world from traveling to the U.S. for business, tourism, or even tourism. Though it doesn’t revoke visas from current students, it does stop their families from visiting and attending their graduation ceremonies.

Secretary Rubio has announced plans to enhance screening for F-1 visa applicants from China or Hong Kong and revoke visas from Chinese students who are either connected to the Chinese Communist Party or majoring in “critical fields.” For the hundreds of thousands of Chinese international students at U.S. colleges and universities, the implications are profound.

ℹ️ What do Trump’s travel restrictions and screening policies mean for your travel plans? Read our blog post to find out.

A new proposal from Secretary Noem replaces F-1 “duration of status” — which lets international students remain in the U.S. so long as they are in school — with a “fixed period of stay” (e.g., four years). For students who change programs, or whose studies take longer than anticipated, this means leaving the country or going through the application process for a second time.

💡 Stop AAPI Hate submitted a public comment in opposition to this proposal for placing undue burden on international students.

Another proposal limits “third-country national” (TCN) visa processing, which allows international students to renew their visas in a country that isn’t their home country. Now, students will have to return to their home countries, which can be far more expensive and time-consuming than traveling to Canada or Mexico, for example. And for students from countries with long visa processing times or political conflict, this will make it even harder to continue their U.S. studies.

Impact on international students

In September 2025, a federal judge in Massachusetts called out the Trump administration for violating the first amendment by systematically targeting pro-Palestinian students as means to spread fear on suppress free speech on campus.

This is promising news — but for international students, it does little to assuage their fears of detention or deportation.

Around 70 white South Africans were relocated to the U.S. in two groups in May and June in what U.S. officials described as the start of the program.
Approximately 400 white South Africans in total have reportedly been moved to the U.S. already.
There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80 per cent Black.
Guerline Jozef, director of immigration for Haitian Bridge Alliance, called the new cap ""white supremacy disguised as refugee policy.""","President Donald Trump is slashing the number of refugees allowed into the United States, and people fleeing war-torn countries, human rights abuses and catastrophes will now be of lower priority than white people from South Africa.

The Trump administration is cutting the number of refugee places to as few as 7,500, for the 2026 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, down from a limit of 125,000 last year under the Biden administration.

The White House did not provide a reason for the drastically lower numbers, which were published in a notice on the Federal Register, but this new cap sets a historic low for refugees being admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.

The notice was published on Sept. 30 but became official on Thursday.

It states admission will ""primarily be allocated"" to the Afrikaner white minority from South Africa, which Trump and some of his supporters allege face ""race-based"" discrimination and violence at home — even claiming, without reliable evidence, that they are at risk of ""genocide.""

But Afghans fleeing persecution under the Taliban, including women facing gender-based violence under the Islamist regime, people escaping the war in Sudan or gang violence in places like Haiti were not considered priorities under the new policy, only Afrikaners.

Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), says the U.S. government is ""politicizing a humanitarian program"" and giving special privilege to Afrikaners.

""It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,"" Aly said in a statement.

Trump policy follows unsubstantiated claims

Aly said this latest order shows ""how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world.""

IRAP is already suing the Trump administration after the president signed an executive order, on his first day in office earlier this year, indefinitely suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program until it ""aligns with the interests"" with the country.

But months later, Trump began opening the door to white South Africans, announcing a new program earlier this year to fast-track the relocation of Afrikaner farmers making unsubstantiated claims they were being subjected to systematic violence.

The South African government has strongly denied this.

Around 70 white South Africans were relocated to the U.S. in two groups in May and June in what U.S. officials described as the start of the program.

Approximately 400 white South Africans in total have reportedly been moved to the U.S. already.

The Washington Post, citing unnamed officials, reported that the U.S. State Department ""has set a goal of processing 2,000 Afrikaners for resettlement by the end of October and an additional 4,000 by the end of November.""

There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80 per cent Black.

Afrikaners, who were at the heart of the country's apartheid system of racial segregation that lasted from 1948 until 1994, are today represented in every facet of South African life and are successful business leaders, some of the country's best-known athletes and also serve in government.

Lowering 'our moral standing'

By comparison, among the top countries of origin for the more than 100,000 refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2024 were the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Syria — countries that have endured years of horrific violence.

Putting the focus on one group ""undermines the [refugee] program's purpose as well as its credibility,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a U.S.-based resettlement agency.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" she said in a statement on the group's website.

The advocacy group Human Rights First called the policy ""blatantly racist.""

“Turning our back on hundreds of thousands of truly at-risk refugees fleeing religious, political, and other forms of persecution defies decades of bipartisan support for welcoming the vulnerable, from Vietnamese to Afghan allies,” Uzra Zeya, the organization's president and a former U.S. State Department official, said in a statement.

Guerline Jozef, director of immigration for Haitian Bridge Alliance, called the new cap ""white supremacy disguised as refugee policy.""

""At a time when Black refugees from Haiti, Sudan, the Congo and Cameroon are drowning at sea, languishing in detention or being deported to death, the U.S. government has decided to open its arms to those who already enjoy global privilege,"" she said, according to The Independent.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, which advocates for resettling at-risk Afghans, described the decision Thursday as a ""horrendous betrayal.""

""I think we need to face facts. This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram.

Kennedy Jr. encouraging the Trump administration to reinstate workers at the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), who were illegally fired on October 15.

OPA administers key programs like Title X, which provides essential family planning services to 2.8 million people, and which was first introduced in 1970 by then-Congressman George H.W. Bush of Texas’ Seventh Congressional District. OPA also administers the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program and provides resources to expand access to embryo donation and adoption as a family building option for families with fertility obstacles.

The letter can be found in its entirety below and here.

""We write to express our grave concern at the recent actions by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to terminate nearly the entire staff at the Office of Population Affairs (OPA). The OPA oversees the nation’s only federal program dedicated to family planning, the Title X program, among other vital reproductive health programs. These firings will severely undermine the functionality of the office, hindering the Title X program’s ability to operate effectively, and threatening the loss of health care for many of the millions of people that these programs support annually.

""On October 10, all but one of the 50 employees at the OPA lost access to their government email accounts. Five days later, they received confirmation from human resources that they were subject to a reduction in force (RIF).

""These RIFs are another example of this Administration’s ongoing assault on the Title X program, birth control, and reproductive health care access more broadly. Earlier this year, HHS illegally withheld $65 million in Congressionally appropriated funding for the Title X program from 16 grantees with grants in 23 states, threatening essential health care access for an estimated 842,000 people, or 30 percent of all Title X patients. Nine of the impacted Title X grantees have yet to have their funding restored seven months later. Many of these affected grantees struggle to sustain the financial burden caused by the extended delay in funding and the ongoing attacks on reproductive health care from this Administration and Congressional Republicans. As a result, they have been forced to close health centers, lay off staff, and reduce available services. As we pass week three of a government shutdown and as Republicans refuse to address the health care crisis they created, the President’s FY2026 budget proposal and House Republicans’ partisan spending bill would only make the situation worse by seeking to eliminate the Title X program entirely.

""For more than 50 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone of safety-net care. Title X-funded health centers are lifelines in their communities, providing high-quality family planning and sexual health care, including cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV testing, contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing, and other essential health care services.

""The bipartisan Title X program, championed by then-Congressman George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Nixon, served 2.8 million people in 2023. For many of those patients, especially in rural and underserved communities, Title X health centers are their only source of health care. In 2023 alone, Title X supported 3,853 health centers across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. The RIFed OPA employees are essential to administering these grants, and without them clinics will be left without the needed support to continue to provide the Title X program’s critical services.

""Undermining the federal government’s ability to effectively administer the Title X program funds will unquestionably result in the loss of health care for patients who depend on it. The dismantling of the OPA threatens to rip away critical services from millions of Americans at thousands of health centers across the country. We urge you to immediately reinstate the OPA employees so they can continue to carry out their essential functions.""",https://escobar.house.gov/images/facebook-meta-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 06:56:39.589842

CHICAGO (AP) — A Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois has been accused of blocking a federal agent’s vehicle during September protests outside an immigration enforcement building in suburban Chicago, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-26T193700Z_946293913_RC2NZGAUM92W_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 23:56:45.574956

(KABC) -- An ICE operation in Ontario turned violent Thursday morning after a man was shot by an ICE agent and then fled the scene. ICE said he tried to intervene in enforcement action and that's why they opened fire.

The shooting happened at around 6:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue.

ICE said that the man who was shot wasn't their original target.

They said they tried to conduct a traffic stop of the driver of a gray sedan when the driver of a Lexus SUV tried to intervene.

ICE said he drove up, turned around, threw his car in reverse and tried to run them over.

That's when an ICE agent opened fire, shooting out of the passenger window.

Video from AIR7 showed a sedan boxed in by an unmarked SUV and a pickup truck on South Vineyard Avenue. The street was shut down at the scene as the investigation continued, but it has reopened.

Ontario police responded to a ""request for emergency assistance"" after Department of Homeland Security officers were involved in a shooting, authorities said.

The request was made at 6:33 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue, the Ontario Police Department said in a statement, adding that its officers were not involved in the initial incident.

The location is in a residential neighborhood west of the Whispering Lakes Golf Course.

""Several Ontario Police Officers responded to the scene to provide traffic control and scene security while DHS conducted their investigation,"" the police department said in a statement. Homeland Security and the FBI were investigating the shooting.

The brother of the man who was shot spoke to Eyewitness News. He said he lives in the nearby mobile park and his brother ran in screaming that he'd been shot in the shoulder.

Police tape surrounded one of the residences on the property of the mobile home park and the Lexus SUV with a shattered window was parked near the home.

Family drove the man to the hospital where they say he's been released, but they now have no idea where he is. They also said he is a U.S. citizen.

Immigrants rights groups were furious over what happened.

""You have federal agents coming in with masked faces, and not having to identify themselves, not having to provide a warrant,"" said Javier Hernandez, the executive director for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.

""The systems that are supposed to protect us are no longer there,"" said Hernandez. ""When the Supreme Court says you can racially profile people, now you have U.S. citizens who are being racially profiled, you have here possibly a U.S. citizen that was shot today.""

Even though the man who they shot is a U.S. citizen, he was not the original target.

ICE did not provide any information on why they were conducting the vehicle stop, nor are they releasing information about the person who allegedly tried to ram them with their vehicle.

Resident Jane Westmoreland says there has been an increase in ICE sweeps in the area in recent months.

""At one time they were keeping the gates closed, and I was told by people who lived at the mobile park that they were doing that because ICE had come in without permission,"" said Westmoreland.

In a statement, ICE said in part ""This is another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day-in and day-out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals. ICE officers now face a 1000% increase in assaults them including cars being used as weapons and death threats against our agents are up 8000%.

""This violence must end. Let me be clear: Anyone who assaults, impedes, obstructs, or threatens the lives of federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Congresswoman Norma Torres also released a statement saying ICE has refused to provide her office with official information despite multiple requests.

""There must be a full, transparent investigation with immediate updates. As we've seen in numerous incidents over the past several months, statements from the Department cannot be taken at face value,"" the statement read.

""Witness statements, body-camera footage, security footage, and all relevant information must be released so the public can judge for themselves what really happened.

The lawmakers warned that opening these untouched coastlines to new offshore drilling would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans’ health and safety at risk, hurting people across the political spectrum.

By reversing long-standing legal protections for vulnerable coastal waters, new offshore leases would cause significant environmental damage to communities already reeling from natural disasters and recent oil spills. Oil spills not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies, and weaken coastal infrastructure. Already, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is forced to respond to over 150 oil and chemical spills each year. One disastrous spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs, and ecosystem restoration.

These threats of expanded oil drilling come as the Administration already dismantled(link is external) NOAA’s oil spill prevention and response programs, as almost 30 percent of the team in charge of addressing oil spills has been laid off or took early retirement. The Emergency Response Division team and the oil spill program are slated to lose half their funding(link is external) from the Administration’s proposed FY 2026 budget.

“This is a matter of national consequence for coastal communities across the country, regardless of political affiliation. It puts our economies, national security, and our most vulnerable ecosystems at severe risk,” wrote the lawmakers. “… Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines.”

“The United States already leads the world in oil and gas production. The industry currently holds more than 2,000 offshore leases covering over 12 million acres of federal waters — yet fewer than 500 of those leases are actively producing oil and gas,” continued the lawmakers. “There is no justification for opening vast swaths of our oceans to leasing when existing leases remain largely unused, while imposing mounting environmental and economic costs on coastal communities.”

Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) previously warned that oil and gas leases in portions of the Eastern Gulf would impact areas critical to our military readiness, including for military training and testing opportunities and assets. DOD has also signaled that parts of the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas are “not compatible with oil and gas activities and infrastructure.”

The lawmakers condemned the potential expansion of offshore drilling while the Administration simultaneously curtails offshore wind and clean energy development. This year, the Trump Administration has withdrawn(link is external) all outer continental offshore wind leases, rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas(link is external), and eliminated $679 million(link is external) in offshore-wind-related port infrastructure funding, including over $426 million for Humboldt Bay offshore wind infrastructure.

Specifically, the lawmakers demanded that President Trump and Secretary Burgum:

Halt any steps toward new offshore oil and gas leasing in the Atlantic, Pacific, off the coast the Arctic and Bering Sea coasts of Alaska, and the Eastern Gulf.

Limit offshore drilling, consistent with previous statutory and agency protections.

Prioritize coastal resilience, including expanded storm-surge and flood protection, restoration of wetlands and sand dunes, and early-warning systems, so that communities in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, New Jersey, Alaska, and beyond are better protected.

Restore a credible pathway for offshore wind and other clean-energy projects by rescinding the OCS wind-leasing withdrawal and rescinded WEAs, enabling science-based projects that support jobs and coastal economies.

“Our coastal communities, fishermen, small business owners, Tribal Nations, tourism operators, and families cannot be sacrificed in the name of short-term drilling booms,” concluded the lawmakers. “Opening new offshore lease areas while cancelling clean energy progress is potentially illegal, a failure of leadership, and a dereliction of the public trust.”",http://pelosi.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/pelosi.house.gov/files/featured_image/Speaker%20Emerita%20Full%20Screen.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 23:56:49.008916

The admissions allocation focus on white Afrikaners expands on Trump’s commitment in an executive order this year to resettle what he described as “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,"" even as he paused refugee admissions.
The new refugee cap is a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's 125,000 target for refugees and a marked decline from the record low cap of 15,000 refugees in Trump's first administration.
The Trump administration in May welcomed dozens of white South Africans to the United States as part of its resettlement effort while it barred refugees from most other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar.
""The Administration has brazenly ignored the statutory requirement to consult with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees before setting the annual refugee admissions ceiling.","The Trump administration dramatically slashed the refugee admissions cap for the new fiscal year starting this month at 7,500, the lowest on record, according to a Federal Register memo posted Thursday.

The memo, dated Sept. 30, said the admissions numbers “shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa,” a white ethnic minority group that controlled South Africa during apartheid, as well as ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.""

The admissions allocation focus on white Afrikaners expands on Trump’s commitment in an executive order this year to resettle what he described as “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,"" even as he paused refugee admissions.

The new refugee cap is a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's 125,000 target for refugees and a marked decline from the record low cap of 15,000 refugees in Trump's first administration. The notice said the new ceiling ""is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.""

The average ceiling for refugees for both Democratic and Republican administrations has historically hovered at 95,000.

The new action follows the South African-born Elon Musk's frequent criticism of the country's land ownership laws against white farmers when he was advising Trump this year in the Department of Government Efficiency.

In his criticism, Musk has highlighted the passage of President Cyril Ramaphosa's Expropriation Act, which allows the government to seize private property, at times without compensation, in certain circumstances ""for a public purpose or in the public interest.""

The Trump administration in May welcomed dozens of white South Africans to the United States as part of its resettlement effort while it barred refugees from most other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar.

Trump’s executive order this year also ended U.S. aid to South Africa, much of which is funneled into the country’s HIV/AIDS program, accusing the South African officials of “confiscating land” from minority farmers “and treating certain classes of people very badly.”

Top Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees, including Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of California, have criticized Trump for the move, saying the new cap was announced without consultation with Congress.

“This bizarre presidential determination is not only morally indefensible, it is illegal and invalid,"" they said in a statement Thursday. ""The Administration has brazenly ignored the statutory requirement to consult with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees before setting the annual refugee admissions ceiling. That process exists to ensure that decisions of such great consequence reflect our nation’s values, our humanitarian commitments, and the rule of law, not the racial preferences or political whims of any one president.""

This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,” he said in a video posted on Instagram.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is restricting the number of refugees admitted annually to the United States to 7,500 and they will mostly be white South Africans, a dramatic drop announced Thursday that effectively suspends America's traditional role as a haven for those fleeing war and persecution.

The move cements a major shift in policy toward refugees that aligns with the Republican administration’s broader goals of keeping out foreigners whom it deems a risk to the nation’s security or a threat to U.S. jobs. That shift has meant increased immigration enforcement, in cities and at borders and entry points, in what’s become a vastly changed landscape in a country long seen as a beacon for migrants.

No reason was given for the new numbers, which were published in a notice on the Federal Register and are a steep decrease from last year’s ceiling of 125,000 set under Democratic President Joe Biden. The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.

The notice said the admission of the 7,500 refugees during the 2026 budget year, which began Oct. 1, was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” It made no mention of any other specific groups to be admitted besides the white South Africans, known also as Afrikaners.

""Other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands” will be considered as refugees, according to the notice, which gave no specifics on who that could entail.

The lower cap represents another blow for the long-standing refugee program that until recently enjoyed bipartisan support.

Groups denounce the historically low cap

Groups that work to resettle refugees said the announcement was an abdication of the country's historic role in welcoming refugees from around the world.

“This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, President and CEO of Global Refuge, one of the nationwide resettlement agencies. “To concentrate the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”

Trump suspended the refugee program on his first day in office and since then only a trickle have entered the country, mostly white South Africans. Some refugees have also been admitted as part of a court case seeking to allow entry to refugees who were overseas and in the process of coming to the U.S. when the program was suspended.

The International Refugee Assistance Project, which sued over the program's suspension, said in a statement that refugees waiting to be admitted to the U.S. have already gone through rigorous security checks and are stuck in dangerous conditions.

“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program,"" said the group's president, Sharif Aly.

Other nationalities, including Afghans, are left out

The administration announced the program for the Afrikaners in February, saying that white South African farmers faced discrimination and violence at home. The South African government strongly denied it.

Presidents have the authority to set the cap on refugee admissions as they see fit, often taking input from the State Department or consulting with the refugee resettlement agencies. This cap would set a historic low of refugees admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.

During his first term, Trump progressively set the cap increasingly lower each year until it reach 15,000 in the last year of his administration.

The determinations usually lay out which regions of the world the refugees will come from over the upcoming year.

Left out from Thursday's notice were Afghans, many of whom have been trying to flee the Taliban after the U.S. withdrawal there in 2021.

A separate program for Afghans who worked closely with the U.S. government is still admitting Afghans into the country. But tens of thousands of others who also contributed to the U.S. mission there have been trying to emigrate to America via the refugee program and this year have been largely shut out.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, which advocates for resettling at-risk Afghans, described the decision Thursday as a “horrendous betrayal.”

“I think we need to face facts. This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,” he said in a video posted on Instagram. “This is a really bad day.”

In a supplementary declaration filed on Oct. 22, Lopez said staff have had to stop working ""almost entirely"" on other programs since ICE ramped up immigration enforcement in Oregon.

The lawsuit is ongoing with an evidentiary hearing scheduled in December.

If they choose to undermine free elections, weaponize the justice system or dismantle the social contract, they will be held accountable through lawful political means.
Democrats must put the Trump administration on notice that the era of impunity will end soon — and no Supreme Court can protect them from that.","President Donald Trump keeps getting away with it. He’s survived two impeachments, multiple criminal charges (and one conviction) and several unlawful and unconstitutional actions in the first few months of his second term.

Thinking too much about that can lead to despair about the future of the country. How can we hope to repair the damage Trump is doing on a daily basis if we can’t hold him accountable?

But Trump isn’t doing these things alone. From billionaire supporters such as Elon Musk to top advisers such as Stephen Miller to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out his deportations, the president is dependent on other people to carry out his agenda.

That points to a tactic that Democrats need to embrace: Put all of Trump’s happy helpers on notice. The Supreme Court may have decided that the president has broad immunity, but that’s not the case for Musk, Miller and the masked men terrorizing Chicago.

Democrats need to make it clear to every one of those underlings that they will be held accountable.

That’s why Democrats in Congress and in governors’ mansions and state legislatures need to make it clear to every one of those underlings that they will be held accountable — if not today, then one day soon.

Some Democrats realize this. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker created the Illinois Accountability Commission to document interactions between ICE agents and Chicagoans during Operation Midway Blitz and held them accountable. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell told Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr and his staff to “get a lawyer and save your records” for a future hearing on their dealings when Democrats hope to hold the House majority in 2027.

The nation has endured a sustained shock to its democratic system. We are drowning in chaos, so much so that this week alone marks the fifth week of a government shutdown. Forty million people are at risk of losing food benefits and ICE agents are operating like Trump’s modern-day Gestapo. The abuses of power, the legal intimidation campaigns, the politicized prosecutions and the cruelty on display from immigration enforcement have piled up so relentlessly that many Americans have begun to treat the unacceptable as routine.

Authoritarian behavior has crept into everyday governance. It has been normalized. This normalization presents a profound and irreversible danger. Someone must break this trance and say what is obvious. And the only political entity with the legitimacy and structure to deliver that alarm is the Democratic Party.

Democratic senators and representatives have to create their own bullhorn of accountability — raging against not just the illiberal and unconstitutional behavior of a rogue president, but also making it very clear to everyone inside and outside the Trump administration that they will be held accountable for their actions. Period.

Democratic leadership must warn every official, every aide, every lawyer and every strategist that their decisions will not be forgotten.

Democratic leadership must directly and publicly warn every official, every aide, every lawyer and every strategist who participates in attacks on democratic institutions that their decisions will not be forgotten. Their conduct will be scrutinized. If they choose to undermine free elections, weaponize the justice system or dismantle the social contract, they will be held accountable through lawful political means.

The American people are waiting. They are looking to Democrats, expecting them to defend access to health care and a strong social safety net, yes; but also, the foundations of the republic: representative government and the rule of law. Republicans have abandoned these commitments, repeatedly promising to “fix” health care, only to repeatedly oppose expanding Medicaid and affordable coverage options, while offering no comprehensive alternative to rising medical costs or gaps in access. Republicans have also sat silently and often complicitly in the destruction of the symbols of our nation, the upending of constitutional norms, the erasure of our civil liberties and the efforts to steal congressional seats.

The question for Democratic leaders is simple: Are you ready to wage the kind of politics the moment demands? Are you prepared to impose accountability on those who would dismantle our democracy for their own gain? Are you prepared to show your fellow citizens that the days of consequence-free corruption in Washington are over?

Courts alone cannot protect our democratic institutions. A lone politician with a sharply worded letter cannot reverse institutional decay. Only a collective force, organized and relentless, can confront this assault on democracy and put accountability back on the table.

Democrats must put the Trump administration on notice that the era of impunity will end soon — and no Supreme Court can protect them from that.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251030-jb-pritzker-zz-a6d344.jpg",N,,2025-10-31 01:56:43.011431

Two SUNY Upstate Medical University employees were detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Wednesday.

The men were taken into custody before entering immigration court hearings to finalize their legal status, the Civil Service Employees Association said in a release.

Both employees worked in the environmental services department at SUNY Upstate, a state-owned hospital in Syracuse. They have worked in New York state since 2022 and 2024, respectively, according to CSEA.

In a Thursday morning statement to The Daily Orange, a SUNY Upstate spokesperson said, to their knowledge, the employees had the legal authority to live and work in the U.S. and were “productive members of the community.”

“These hard-working employees are an integral part of our hospital’s Environmental Services team which we depend upon to maintain a safe environment for patient care,” the spokesperson said. “They are a respected part of the Upstate family, and we are working to support them.”

One employee is a CSEA member, while the other is represented by Upstate United University Professions.

In a Wednesday night statement to The D.O., UUP President Frederick Kowal said the union would “stand shoulder to shoulder” with its members, fighting for the right to due process.

“(The men) acted in good faith to finalize their legal status,” Kowal said. “But as we have seen over and over under the anti-immigrant regime in place in Washington D.C., they were met with handcuffs.”

In its statement, CSEA said it stands in solidarity with the workers and called the detainment of people following the legal process “unjust” and “inhumane.”

“They are part of our Upstate family, they are our co-workers, our neighbors, and valued contributors to the hospital and community,” CSEA President Mary Sullivan said in the statement. “No one should be punished for following the law. Our union members and all hospital employees deserve dignity, respect and the chance to live and work without fear.”

The reason ICE detained the employees is “unclear,” Kowal said, and they are currently being held in a federal detention facility in Batavia, awaiting potential deportation.

ICE did not immediately respond to The D.O.’s request for comment.

Durango Police Chief Brice Current requested the investigation, according to the CBI statement.

The Durango protest on Tuesday was over the earlier arrest and detention of a Colombian man, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, and his two children. The trio was detained on their way to school. The family has an active asylum case and has been in Colorado for 18 months, according to the Durgano-based nonprofit Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

During the protest, held outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, a law enforcement officer, who CBI says appears to be a federal agent, was video recorded grabbing a woman’s phone and pushing her to the ground. The video was published by The Colorado Sun.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Wednesday that ICE did not inform his office about the operation to detain Jaramillo-Solano.

The current rule gives immigrants a period of 540 days for their permit to renew automatically while their documents are pending.

Now, the new process, which targets Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization, calls for stricter vetting. USCIS said the new rule is meant to ""deter fraud"" and ""detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the United States.""

“USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow in a written statement. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended. All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”

The USCIS is recommending that immigrants renew their work permits promptly, which includes filing for renewal 180 days before expiration.

“The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation,” USCIS said.

Any individual who filed to renew their Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization after Oct. 30 will not receive the automatic renewal. However, the new rule does not impact those who extended their permit before that date.

There are some exceptions to the new rule, according to the USCIS, which include extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for TPS-related employment documentation.

A group of 20 Democratic AGs and the Governor of Kentucky obtained a preliminary injunction barring the U.S. Department of Agriculture from withholding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding during ongoing litigation over USDA's demand that states disclose information from SNAP records about applicants and recipients. USDA had notified states that it would withhold significant SNAP funds from any state that failed to comply with its data-sharing requirement.

In its order granting the preliminary injunction, the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California found that the plaintiff states had demonstrated: a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that USDA's data-sharing demand and threatened disallowance of funding violated the SNAP Act; that they were likely to incur irreparable harm if SNAP funds were withheld; and that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored injunctive relief.

We previously covered the filing of the complaint and the court's issuance of a temporary restraining order against USDA.

In the letter, Pritzker referenced the operation earlier this week on the northwest side of Chicago in which agents deployed tear gas as children were gathering for a costume parade.

The episode prompted a warning to ICE officials from a federal judge reviewing the actions of agents taking part in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s surge of federal forces into the Chicago area, ostensibly to fight gangs.

After refinement, ICE officials came back with a set of 1,277,464 requests, sought by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested information from the IRS on 1.28 million US taxpayers, matching the records of 47,000 people, court records show.

The IRS filed redacted emails and records requests as a part of the administrative record produced in a lawsuit brought by taxpayer advocacy groups including the Center for Taxpayer Rights and unions including the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO. The groups sought a preliminary injunction to halt IRS disclosure of taxpayer information to the Department of Government Efficiency.

The disclosures show IRS officials attempting to respond to a request the DOJ acknowledged was unprecedented, but also says falls within IRC Section 6103, the Tax Code provision intended to protect taxpayer information from unauthorized disclosure.

ICE requested the information pursuant to a carve-out in Section 6103 that allows information disclosures in the event an individual is under criminal investigation. This is one of several lawsuits challenging ICE’s requests for large data sets of taxpayer information at once.

The IRS responds to about 30,000 requests in a typical year. The requests have very specific rules, requiring the requesting agency provide the name, taxpayer number, and address of a person; the justification for seeking the record; and an agency head’s approval before the IRS responds.

ICE’s first request, for about 700,000 people who were under final orders of removal, came Feb. 18, according to an email from Guy Ficco, chief of the IRS’ criminal investigation division. A later email shows that information was requested by Caleb Vitello, who was acting director of ICE for several weeks.

An analysis sent back several days later by former IRS Deputy Commissioner Douglas W. O’Donnell, who has since retired, indicated the IRS “cannot provide information responsive to the request made,” citing Section 6103.

After a memorandum of understanding was signed in April, the agencies facilitated a secure large file transfer via Kiteworks. In June, ICE provided data for and requested the records of “the full alien population, which contains 7,615,279 records.” Acting IRS Chief Counsel Andrew De Mello determined there were several deficiencies and didn’t process the request.

After refinement, ICE officials came back with a set of 1,277,464 requests, sought by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

A further request on June 27 returned just 3.7% matches; 93.7% didn’t match and 2.6% didn’t met specifications of the MOU. The IRS rejected the request if the record wasn’t at least 90 days old, according go an August 7 email from Lou Capece, coordinating director of infrastructure for the IRS.

The IRS indicated that about 47,000 records matched data in that request, depending on the date and time of the run. The messages don’t indicate how many were actually sent to ICE.

“There is no need for a press release or broad disclosure of the fact that this information is being provided and the MOU does not discuss any publicizing of the disclosure,” said Kenneth Kies, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, in the last email in the record, which is dated Aug. 7.

The plaintiffs allege the disclosures violate the Tax Reform Act, the Privacy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

“The dangers posed by these disclosures are real, imminent threats to core privacy rights,” Maddy Gitomer, counsel for the plaintiffs said. “The administration’s ongoing rush to execute this dangerous policy will have disastrous consequences if not stopped urgently.”

The IRS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Even before the shutdown, emergency food programs nationwide widely reported that they were unable to meet the current surging demand for food.","US elites tend to have a “normalcy bias” that allows them to believe our political leaders would never take actions so reckless, and so clearly detached from reality, that they would grievously harm the country.

Many elites simply couldn’t fathom that President George W. Bush would invade a sovereign nation based on false pretenses or that President Donald Trump would incite a violent riot to try to overturn democracy.

Likewise, elites were largely in denial about the grave threat to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—formerly called the Food Stamp Program—during a showdown.

Prior to the shutdown, I warned some colleagues and elected officials that President Trump and congressional Republicans could use a shutdown as an excuse to deny up to 42 million SNAP recipients (and more than 260,000 neighborhood SNAP retailers) nationwide of $8 billion per month in grocery funds. Many assumed that I was exaggerating the threat and there was no way that our political system would allow something that disastrous to occur. But that is exactly what is playing out.

On the same day that Trump pledged to CNN that he would continue SNAP payments in November, his own Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the government wouldn’t. The next day, the USDA used its website to double down on the SNAP shutdown, using lies about immigrants and a false smear against transgender Americans in a partisan message that clearly violated the federal Hatch Act prohibition on using tax dollars for partisan purposes. Even if Trump or the GOP Congress or the Democratic attorneys general suing the government over the debacle succeed in ending the SNAP shutdown, there will still be a significant delay in the delivery of November’s SNAP benefits.

It wasn’t always this way. In the late 1960s and 1970s, prompted by Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign and widespread media coverage of the serious domestic hunger problem, a bipartisan coalition in Washington (including President Nixon, President Carter, conservative Republican Senator Robert Dole, and liberal Democratic Senator George McGovern) started the National School Breakfast Program and the Women, Infants, and Children Program for pregnant women and children under 5. Most significantly, they created the Food Stamp Program, which eventually enabled tens of millions of Americans to receive monthly benefits to help them afford groceries. Collectively, these programs worked spectacularly, almost entirely ending hunger in America.

But, starting in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan combined crushing unions and outsourcing middle-class jobs overseas with using racial dog whistles to demonize those receiving social safety net benefits. Building on the divisive but electorally successful rhetoric of George Wallace, Reagan decried “strapping young bucks” getting food stamps, and began to slash away at domestic food assistance.

The GOP intensified its racist rhetoric to undermine the social safety net during the time of the Obama administration, as Newt Gingrich called Obama the “food stamp president” and Senator Rick Santorum implied that non-white people were uniquely dependent upon food stamps (for the record, the plurality of SNAP recipients were then, and are today, white). Even the supposed moderate Republican Mitt Romney falsely accused Obama of eliminating work requirements for food stamps, which the GOP maintains are necessary into promote work for people in safety net programs even though data proves such requirements don’t increase employment and even though conservatives never impose such work requirements on programs that aid the wealthiest Americans.

The bipartisan anti-hunger coalition unraveled. In 2018, when the Paul Ryan–led US House voted to take billions of dollars’ worth of food from millions of SNAP recipients, not a single House Democrat voted for the bill, but 86 percent of House Republicans did.

Massive influxes of federal food and cash aid allotted by Democrats kept US hunger at bay during the economic recession caused by the pandemic. But after conservatives, including then–Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, allowed such assistance to expire, US hunger soared. The USDA found that the number Americans who lived in food-insecure households (meaning they were unable to afford a sufficient supply of food) jumped to 47 million people in 2023, a 40 percent increase over 2021. The number of food insecure Americans in 2023 exceeded the total populations of the states of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Virginia, combined.

Fully 17 percent of US children, 10 percent of employed adults, and 8 percent of older Americans lived in food-insecure households from 2021 to 2023, according to an analysis of USDA data from my organization, Hunger Free America.

The number of Americans who didn’t have enough to eat over two one-week periods increased by 55 percent between August/September 2021 and August/September 2024, according to our computation of Census Household Pulse Survey data.

Still, over this time period, many elites (even liberal ones) have celebrated the supposed overall health of the economy, ignoring that struggling Americans can’t eat a rising GDP. These same economic cheerleaders then scratched their heads when Americans voted against the Democratic administration, which they blamed (often incorrectly) for their troubles. With Trump back in the White House, advancing an openly racist agenda, it was only a matter of time before his administration took aim at the nutrition safety net.

We didn’t have to wait long. In their big ugly bill, Trump and his congressional GOP puppets slashed $186 billion out of SNAP, the deepest cut in history, citing the outrageously false charge that most SNAP spending is on “illegal aliens” and “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Not a single House or Senate Democrat voted for the bill, and of the tiny handful of GOP Members of Congress who voted against the bill, most did so because the SNAP cuts weren’t large enough. Contrary to their assertions, the vast majority of SNAP recipients harmed by the cuts are low-paid workers, children, people with disabilities, older Americans, and/or veterans. On top of all that, the Trump administration canceled more than 84 million pounds of food aid scheduled to be distributed by charities, many of which are faith-based.

Then, in an act of reality-denial fit for Noth Korea, the Trump administration ended USDA’s 27-year practice of collecting and publishing food insecurity data, citing variety of preposterous justifications for doing so. Its obvious that their real reason for eliminating this data is their desire to keep the public in the dark about how Trump’s failing tariff and other economic policies—combined with the massive food aid cuts—are causing US hunger to skyrocket even more exponentially. Obviously, the ostrich approach won’t end hunger.

Now nearly 42 million Americans nationwide may lose access to sufficient food. Not only would this create the greatest domestic hunger crises since the Great Depression; it would also wreak havoc on food retailers, perhaps even forcing some to lay off staff.

No one should be duped into thinking that charitable food programs can make up for the end of SNAP, which provides literally 10 times the dollar amount for food as does every charity in America. Even before the shutdown, emergency food programs nationwide widely reported that they were unable to meet the current surging demand for food.

The map below, complied by Hunger Free America using USDA and Census Bureau data, shows the percentage of each state’s population that relies on SNAP. In red states like Louisiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, more than 15 percent of the population relies on SNAP. More than 10 percent of residents receive SNAP in Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Texas, South Carolina, and Missouri.

Ad Policy

Many SNAP recipients are Trump supporters and Republican voters. It’s no wonder that key GOP leaders and MAGA acolytes have starting pivoting away from lambasting SNAP to defending it as key to helping the “vulnerable,” incorrectly blaming Democrats for halting it.

So, where do we go from here?

While progressives should push governors and state legislatures to take emergency steps to ameliorate the impact of the shutdown, the only real solution is to pressure Trump and congressional Republicans to compromise with the Democrats on a plan that both reopens the federal government and prevents tens of millions of Americans from suffering from huge spikes in their healthcare premiums.

After all, if people have to spend hundreds of more dollars per month on healthcare, they will have far less to spend of food, so those premium hikes would also increase hunger. That’s why this healthcare fight is also an anti-hunger fight. We must all hang tough and win.

Beyond that, progressives should consistently and forcefully advocate for transforming our nation’s policies and programs in order to ensure an “Opportunity Society,” in which people who work hard don’t just get by but actually get ahead. We must build upon a reliance on means-tested programs aimed at mostly the impoverished in order to also focus more broadly on helping a wide array of Americans with universal programs, as well as comprehensive policies to help struggling Americans transition from owing debts and paying interest (and losing wealth) to owning assets—such as homes, small businesses, and savings—that earn interest (and accumulate wealth).

The most effective—and most political popular—policies need to restore the American dream for both the middle class and then tens of millions of American struggling to rise into the middle class. America can achieve normalcy again only when we have society that works for everyone.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1186596424.jpeg,N,,2025-10-30 21:04:08.230820

Chanthila ""Shawn"" Souvannarath, 44, was deported on Friday, according to his attorneys, a day after a federal judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep him in the country so that he could present what the judge called a ""substantial claim of U.S. citizenship.""

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but has lived most of his life in the U.S. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the judge's order keeping him in the country ""was not served"" to ICE until after Souvannarath had been deported.

""To the media's chagrin, there was no mistake,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

DHS and ICE did not respond to questions from The Associated Press seeking additional details on the timeline and how officials receive federal court orders.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Souvannarath, asked U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick to order his immediate return to the U.S., calling the deportation ""unlawful.""

""ICE has acted in direct opposition to a federal court order, which should disturb everyone,"" said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana.

The deportation comes as Trump administration officials have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants. There have been previous cases of U.S. citizens being deported, including U.S.-born children.

Souvannarath most recently lived in Arab, Alabama. Court records show he was granted lawful permanent residence in the U.S. before his first birthday. His father, a native of Laos, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Souvannarath claims his citizenship derives from that status.

Souvannarath was taken into ICE custody in June following an annual check-in with immigration authorities. Two of his five children were with him when he was detained, his wife told the AP.

McLaughlin said Souvannarath ""lost his green card"" and was ordered to be deported in 2006 following convictions for ""heinous crimes"" — assault and unlawful possession of a firearm — and ""had no right to be in this country."" It was not clear why Souvannarath was not previously taken into ICE custody.

In 2004, Souvannarath was convicted of unlawful firearm possession and assault against his then-girlfriend in King County, Washington. He had also been convicted of a misdemeanor assault against the same woman several years before, court records show.

""20 years later, he tried a Hail Mary attempt to remain in our country by claiming he was a U.S. citizen,"" McLaughlin wrote in her statement. ""I know its shocking to the media — but criminal illegal aliens lie all the time.""

Souvannarath's wife, Beatrice, described him as a hard worker and loving father who stayed out of trouble since his run-ins with the law two decades ago. He's mostly worked installing air conditioners and heaters, she said. ""He doesn't even drink,"" she said.

His wife said she received word last week that he was being deported and, days later, that he was in custody in Laos, a country he had not previously visited.

Representing himself in court, Souvannarath filed an emergency motion seeking to halt his deportation. The judge, appointed by President Barack Obama, cited the ""irreparable harm that would be caused by immediate deportation"" in issuing a temporary restraining order pausing the deportation for 14 days.

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

""I think it's very problematic,"" Van Hollen told The Associated Press. ""They want to keep the public in the dark.""

The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people — sometimes for hours — on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and six others.

The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the WRAP's use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

""When an organization like DHS doesn't want transparency, it's because they don't want people to know what they're doing,"" Van Hollen said, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.

In addition to the letter, U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told AP in a statement that she is working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the WRAP.

""ICE's use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,"" Ramirez said.

DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the WRAP. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said that ICE's practices ""align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.""

The AP found that DHS has paid the manufacturer of the WRAP, Safe Restraints Inc., $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it's not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE's use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined ""restraint"" played a role in the death.

""The brutal, inhumane tactics of ICE continue to jeopardize people's lives across the country,"" Ramirez said. ""ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability.

Nana Regional Corp. is supposed to uphold Iñupiat values. Some shareholders say its role in the president’s deportation machinery makes a mockery of that. Through several presidential administrations, the company has turned itself into a large government contractor, with its biggest revenue generator run out of an office park in a suburb of Washington, DC. Nana’s largest contracts, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, are with the Department of Defense. But over the past decade, one of its fastest-growing lines of government business is with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Warships, Fighter Jets and the CIA – What is Trump’s Endgame in Venezuela?

For two months, the US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea. It is the largest deployment there for decades. Long-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out “bomber attack demonstrations” off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world’s largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region. The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry “narcotics” and “narco-terrorists”, without providing evidence or details about those on board. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. They are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro from power.

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said that it was ""an unfortunate situation"" that Democrats were not briefed but that he believed they would be included in future briefings.

""I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way,"" he said. ""It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis.""

Rounds also said that based on the briefing, he believes the strikes were legal.

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., also said Democrats should have been briefed.

""I don’t think any administration should leave out any party from a briefing that level of importance,"" he said, adding, ""I think all of that should be available to people who oversee them.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump’s, said that it “wouldn’t be appropriate” for Democrats not to be briefed and that “the goal is to brief everybody, not just Republicans.”

Warner said he was incensed to learn that the administration shared its legal justification for the strikes during the briefing, since Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “personally promised” him that information would be shared with the bipartisan Gang of 8, which still has not happened yet.

Asked by NBC News whether he got an explanation for why Democrats were excluded, Warner said: “We got a ham-handed ‘Oh, maybe you’re right.’ ... I say bulls---.”

The White House accused Democrats of ""pushing bogus claims about the administration’s efforts to kill narcoterrorists to distract from their decision to shut the government down and force federal employees and military servicemembers to work without pay.""

""The Department of War has held nine bipartisan briefings on narcoterrorist strikes, with additional bipartisan briefings scheduled, and individually works through requests from the Hill,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. ""It’s pathetic that these Democrats care more about running cover for foreign drug smugglers and illegal immigrants seeking taxpayer-funded health care than paying federal workers and protecting American citizens from deadly narcotics.”

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, also said he disagrees with the premise that Democrats were left out because Democrats are “free to do whatever they want to do. They can ask for a briefing, just like we got.”

“Those of us that are on the Intelligence Committee, Republicans or Democrats, can get briefings anytime they want on these,” Risch said. “It’s not unusual for us to ask for briefings individually or as a group or, for that matter, as Republicans. Democrats do the same.”

Meanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee held a bipartisan classified briefing on the strikes Thursday. But Democratic committee member Jason Crow, of Colorado, told NBC News that Pentagon lawyers were pulled away from the briefing at the last minute, so members did not get any legal justifications for the strikes, leaving him “unsatisfied.”

Rep. Gregory Meeks, of New York, top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Thursday's briefing was “incredible for how little information was shared, how little time the briefers stayed to answer questions, and how completely absent any credible legal rationale was for the administration’s unauthorized, ongoing expansion of these strikes.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-capitol-building-se-1055a-fbbf98.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 21:04:12.307987

EAD renewal applicants filing on or after October 30 will no longer receive an automatic extension of employment authorization.
Adjust I-9 reverification tracking and HR compliance systems to avoid unintentional lapses in employment authorization.
For Employees and Individuals: File EAD renewal applications as early as possible—USCIS recommends up to 180 days before expiration.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have announced a policy change that will end the automatic extension of employment authorization documents (EADs) for certain renewal applicants. The change will take effect on October 30, 2025.

Background

Under current regulations, certain EAD renewal applicants receive an automatic extension of their work authorization for up to 540 days if they timely file a renewal application before their existing EAD expires. This policy allows applicants to continue working after the expiration of their existing EAD, for up to 540 days, while the renewal application is pending. The automatic extension terminates once USCIS approves or denies the renewal application.

What Is Changing

Under an Interim Final Rule (IFR), which will be published and take effect on October 30, 2025, this automatic extension will no longer apply. EAD renewal applicants filing on or after October 30 will no longer receive an automatic extension of employment authorization. For these applicants, if processing of the renewal extends past the expiration of their existing EAD, they will lose work authorization upon the expiration of that EAD, and need to wait for USCIS to adjudicate the renewal application and produce a new EAD before accepting or resuming employment.

The IFR indicates that this is part of DHS’s broader effort to prioritize the screening and vetting of foreign nationals. How these attempts at increased vetting will affect EAD processing times is uncertain—but an increase in processing times, coupled with the elimination of the automatic extension, would likely result in substantial disruption for employers and employees. DHS notes in the IFR that it expects EAD filing rates and processing times to decline, thus reducing the need for automatic extensions to avoid lapses in employment authorization. However, EAD renewal applications can be filed no earlier than six months before an EAD expiration, and shorter processing times have yet to materialize. According to USCIS’s own data, at present, some EAD applications take well over a year to be processed.

Who Is Affected

This change primarily affects applicants who have received EADs based on humanitarian grounds, including asylum applicants, refugees, foreign nationals granted Withholding of Removal, and certain recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), among others. The change also applies to spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders (H-4 dependents), as well as those whose EAD cards are based on pending Adjustment of Status applications, though the impact to these populations may be somewhat more limited, as explained below.

Exceptions

The change does not affect:

F-1 students applying for STEM OPT;

Spouses of L-1, E-1, E-2, and E-3 nonimmigrant visa holders (L-2S, E-1S, E-2S, and E-3S, respectively), who are authorized to work incident to status (i.e., they are authorized to work based on their status alone, even without an EAD);

Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., certain TPS designations or automatic extensions announced through Federal Register notices);

DACA recipients, whose EADs have never been eligible for automatic extensions; or

Applicants who file EAD renewal applications before the change takes effect on October 30, 2025.

Limited Impact on Certain EAD Applicants

As a practical matter, the change will have a somewhat limited effect on:

Spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders (H-4 dependent spouses), who only benefit from the current 540-day automatic extension in limited circumstances, and only after overcoming significant logistical hurdles. That said, the change will certainly impact H-4 spouses who were previously willing and able to jump through the necessary hoops to avail themselves of the automatic extension; and

Applicants who receive an EAD based on a pending Adjustment of Status application (Form I-485). USCIS currently approves these EADs for a five-year period, and applicants generally receive their “green cards” well before an EAD needs to be renewed.

Practical Recommendations

For Employers:

Identify employees whose work authorization relies on EADs that expire after October 30, 2025, and consult with immigration counsel to determine the impact of this change (if any).

Adjust I-9 reverification tracking and HR compliance systems to avoid unintentional lapses in employment authorization.

Communicate with affected employees about renewal timing and potential employment gaps.

For Employees and Individuals:

File EAD renewal applications as early as possible—USCIS recommends up to 180 days before expiration.

Plan ahead to avoid interruptions in work authorization after October 30, 2025.

Explore alternative visa or work authorization options if continued employment is critical.

The teen said she tried to keep her diagnosis private for several months, but told ABC News she is speaking out to defend her father.
“Regardless of what you feel about immigration or the levels of immigration or the level of enforcement — those are fair debates for us to have.
Torres said despite how her father was treated, she has “nothing but love” for the federal agents who arrested her father.","(CHICAGO) — Chicago immigration judge Eva Saltzman on Thursday set a $2,000 bond for Ruben Torres-Maldonado, whose 16-year-old daughter Ofelia Torres is battling stage 4 cancer. Torres-Maldonado will be released from immigration detention as early as Thursday.

During the hearing, the judge not only ruled for him to be released, but also said he is now eligible to apply for a cancellation of removal based on the hardship his family would endure if he’s forced to leave the country. If his application is denied, he could still face deportation.

Despite the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier claiming Torres-Maldonado was a “criminal illegal alien” who has a history of driving offenses, Saltzman said she had no reason to believe that he posed a risk to the public.

“I see that you have very strong family ties and community ties in the United States and that you’ve hired an attorney which shows me that you take these proceedings very seriously,” the judge said. “And I see nothing in the record that would indicate to me that you pose a danger to the community.”

Torres-Maldonado also noted during the hearing that he has a valid license and insurance.

“I wish you much luck in the future, and I wish your daughter a full recovery,” the judge said.

DHS didn’t immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment about the judge’s order.

In an interview with ABC News last week, 16-year-old Ofelia Torres recalled receiving a strange phone call on Oct. 18. She said her mom had just put on sterile gloves and was helping to drain the ascites — a buildup of fluid — in her abdomen when it came.

“The first call that came through was Walgreens, and so we just declined the call. It was probably just my medication,” Torres said. “Another call came through and it said prison slash jail and I was like ‘Why is the prison calling me?’ But in my head, I kind of knew, I think they got my dad.”

Since learning that federal immigration agents arrested Torres-Maldonado at a Home Depot in Niles, Illinois, on Oct. 18, Ofelia has made it her mission to continue fighting her stage 4 cancer diagnosis and her father’s possible deportation too.

ABC News interviewed the teen at her home in Chicago last week as part of a “Nightline” story on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement mission in the state. Dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” by the administration, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) campaign targeting undocumented people in Chicago and greater Illinois.

Torres-Maldonado is one of more than 2,800 undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it has apprehended in the Chicago area since they announced the operation in early September.

At a recent press conference, attorney Kalman Resnick, who is representing Torres-Maldonado, said federal agents surrounded his client’s vehicle, smashed the window of his truck and “dragged” him into a vehicle at gunpoint.

ICE is under the supervision of the DHS. In a statement sent to ABC News before the hearing, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin alleged that Torres-Maldonado backed into a government vehicle while attempting to flee.

“His criminal history shows he has a history of habitual driving offenses and has been charged multiple

times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding,” McLaughlin said.

Torres denied the government’s claims that her father is a criminal.

“I’ve gotten a parking ticket, am I a criminal?” she said. “Sometimes we break a law without even knowing, does that make us criminal? I don’t know.”

Torres was diagnosed with metastatic aviolar rhabdomyosarcoma — an aggressive form of cancer — last December. The teen said she tried to keep her diagnosis private for several months, but told ABC News she is speaking out to defend her father. She said Torres-Maldonado instilled in her a sense of gratitude for the country they call home.

“I need the world to know my dad’s story and if that means letting the world know I have cancer, so be it. I don’t care,” she said. “I need my dad.”

The immigration crackdown in Chicago has come under scrutiny from advocates and legal experts including Mark Fleming, associate director of Federal Litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, who told ABC News that many of the arrests and detainments have been unlawful.

So far, the human rights organization National Immigrant Justice Center has presented over 800 cases that they claim were unlawful under a consent decree — a court-ordered agreement between parties that resolves a dispute — limiting DHS’ ability to hold someone who entered into the country unlawfully without a bond hearing.

Fleming told ABC News the organization has 280 more cases that his legal team will soon present before a judge.

“It’s truly unprecedented. We are lead counsel in a class action lawsuit that has a consent decree that dictates when and how DHS, Department of Homeland Security, whether it’s Border Patrol or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, can stop and arrest people without warrants,” Fleming said.

“Regardless of what you feel about immigration or the levels of immigration or the level of enforcement — those are fair debates for us to have. What is deeply troubling here is the lawlessness, the violence, the cruelty, the carelessness with which they are doing this operation,” he later added.

Torres said despite how her father was treated, she has “nothing but love” for the federal agents who arrested her father.

“That’s all I have for everyone in this world. Love in my heart,” she said. “To the ICE agents who smashed my dad’s window, to the ICE agent who pointed a gun at my dad, I’m not mad at you … I just want you to know that that was not the right thing to do.”

What we know:

The incident happened just after 6:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue as ICE officers were attempting to conduct a traffic stop.

According to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, an unknown individual, who was not the target, pulled up in a vehicle in front of the officers. Officers ordered the driver to leave the scene, but as the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping, McLaughlin said in a statement. An ICE officer then fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The driver fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle, McLaughlin added.

The family of the man involved in the shooting identified him only as 24-year-old Carlos. Family spokesperson, Javier Hernandez, with the Inland Coalition of Immigrant Justice, said the man stopped his Lexus when he saw federal agents stopping a dark-colored Honda on Vineyard Avenue.

Carlos' family said he was shot in the shoulder, and they immediately drove him to a nearby hospital with federal agents behind them.

""We do know he was released from the hospital but the family doesn't know where he is at, they believe he is in custody of the federal government,"" Hernandez said. ""He was someone being basically surrounded by armed men with masks so he decided to see what was going on.""

The man in the vehicle that was originally stopped during the traffic stop was not injured in the shooting. He was taken into custody by agents. It's unclear why he was stopped.

In targeting Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive candidate for Congress in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, the DOJ’s new case raises stark constitutional and electoral concerns, as opposition to President Donald’s Trump aggressive immigration raids in Chicago has become a central issue in her campaign.

In a statement, Abughazaleh described the charges against her and others as a “political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment.”

“This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks against them. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges,” she said.

The grand jury indictment against Abughazaleh comes after federal agents have already arrested or detained multiple Democratic officials, including Sen. Alex Padilla (Calif.) and Rep. Lamonica McIver (N.J.), who participated in oversight efforts on or demonstrations against Trump’s large-scale mass deportation program.

Alongside Abughazaleh, the DOJ indicted a Democratic candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman, a municipal board member and two other people.

The indictment alleged that they conspired to impede a federal officer by being among a group of people who surrounded a government vehicle outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility last month in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

A video accompanying the indictment showed a large group of people in front of and around a black SUV outside of the Broadview ICE facility. Members of the group threw stuffed animals at the vehicle and pounded on its windows while shouting chants.

The DOJ alleged that by participating in the demonstration, Abughazaleh and the five others attempted to “prevent by force, intimidation, and threat” a federal agent “from discharging the duties of his office, and to injure him in his person or property.”

All six were charged with conspiracy to impede a law enforcement officer and individual counts of impeding a law enforcement officer. If convicted, they could face several years in prison and large fines.

The indictment was also revealed days after senior White House and DOJ officials vowed to go after those who attempt to hold federal immigration agents accountable.

Trump officials made the threats largely in response to federal, state and local Democrats in several states announcing new initiatives to document — and potentially prosecute — federal agents who commit misconduct during immigration operations.

The elected Democrats recently threatened by Trump officials with prosecution or investigation over the ICE accountability efforts include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Bob Bonta, the California attorney general.

Democrats around the country have announced accountability initiatives after countless videos this year — including some promoted by the federal government — have shown federal agents using aggressive tactics in carrying out Trump’s deportation agenda or cracking down on people protesting it.

In Chicago specifically, agents have been seen grabbing people by the throat, indiscriminately deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods, conducting mass raids on apartment complexes and shooting journalists and clergy members in the head with less-than-lethal projectiles.

Pritzker last week announced an independent commission that will create a public record of unlawful actions committed by federal agents in the state while also documenting the effects of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids around Chicago.

Legal experts have noted that while citizens and elected officials have a constitutional right to document any potential misconduct by federal officers, prosecuting agents for state law violations is complicated because of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241649940-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:02.464889

But a section in the Internal Revenue Code, known as 6103, heavily limits taxpayer data sharing, except in specific circumstances. The exceptions include when the information is necessary for a non-tax federal criminal investigation or proceeding in which the United States or a federal agency is a party, and the agency has obtained approval from a court or a federal agency head. And the IRS generally bars agencies from accessing individual taxpayer return information

Douglas O’Donnell, the IRS’s then-acting commissioner, and other agency officials questioned the legality of ICE’s effort under 6103 during the project’s infancy in late February, following a legal analysis from the IRS’s Office of the Chief Counsel and Treasury’s Office of the General Counsel, the emails show.

“Our current understanding,” the analysis reads, “is that ICE’s request does not relate to a criminal investigation, because removal proceedings are generally civil in nature.”

“We cannot provide information responsive to the request made,” O’Donnell wrote in an email to another Treasury official.

Weeks later, Caleb Vitello, the acting director of ICE, asked the IRS to provide “all possible information” on “700 thousand criminal illegal aliens who have standing deportation orders.” The request included known home addresses, employers’ information, relatives, bank names, IP information, and Social Security or taxpayer identification numbers.

ICE spent weeks asking for this data, even as IRS staffers mulled over the legality and practicality of the information exchange, the records show.

O’Donnell, a 38-year veteran of the IRS, abruptly retired in February.

The immigration enforcement agency eventually found a workaround: It could slap a federal criminal penalty for failure to leave the country on the undocumented immigrants to spur a criminal investigation and get Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to sign off on the data sharing effort.

And they could tighten the scope of their data probe to only seek names, addresses and other qualifying information within a taxable period.

Bessent and Noem signed a memorandum of understanding in April, and the data was transferred through a system called Kiteworks this summer. Shortly after, acting IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause, who had replaced O’Donnell, accepted a deferred resignation offer.

The IRS and ICE — which continued to squabble over the minutiae of section 6103 over the summer — contend they’ve worked out the kinks, though it is unclear from the latest emails alone if that’s true.

“ICE launched operation Midway Blitz to remove illegal alien threats to public safety, which is exactly what we have done in Chicago.

This was preventable, and that is precisely why we are working to ensure this doesn’t happen in Indiana or Illinois.”

“This operation wouldn’t have been as successful as it was without our strong 287(g) partnership with the Indiana State Police. Protecting communities from criminal illegal aliens also includes those posing safety threats on our interstates,"" said ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan.

In recent months, we’ve seen a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety and resulting in senseless loss of life.

In August, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a criminal illegal alien—Harjinder Singh— following his arrest for three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida.

Last week, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a criminal illegal alien—Jashanpreet Singh—who killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.

In response, Noem said she wouldn’t be altering immigration enforcement operations this weekend.
They highlighted the trauma and toll that the intensified immigration enforcement has had on not only immigrant communities but every community across the state.","The day before Halloween, Gov. JB Pritzker urged the President Donald Trump administration to suspend its immigration enforcement operations this weekend so families and children can stay safe while celebrating the holiday.

Speaking from Springfield, Pritzker said he sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem asking them to pause all federal agent operations for the entirety of the Halloween weekend. Halloween is Friday, followed by Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) on Saturday and Sunday. The latter honors friends and family members who’ve passed away.

“I’m asking for basic human decency. I think their response will be revealing. They’ve disrupted everything for more than two months already. Give the children and the families of Illinois a break, Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Pritzker said. “This is about something other than you just causing mayhem on our streets and visiting cruelty upon our people.”

For nearly two months, DHS — which oversees federal agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) — has been carrying out its so-called “Operation Midway Blitz” throughout the Chicagoland area. The operation, according to Noem, is supposed to be targeting the “worst of the worst.”

However, Pritzker said today that’s not what’s happening across the state, and it’s far from the expressed goals of federal immigration authorities. He also noted that the militarized immigration enforcement is happening at “a pace and scale that is wider and more intense than in previous weeks.”

“They have targeted families and children, burrito vendors, landscapers, delivery drivers, nannies, U.S. citizens, legal residents and longtime Chicagoans, people who have never broken the law,” Pritzker said.

During an interview on Thursday with Fox News, Noem was asked if she would pause immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. In response, Noem said she wouldn’t be altering immigration enforcement operations this weekend.

“No, we’re going to be out on the streets in full force and increase our activities to make sure kids are safe. Every day in Chicago, we’re arresting murderers, child pedophiles, those who have perpetuated assault and pornography against children,” Noem said. “We’re going to be out there to make sure that they can be safe, enjoy the holiday, spend some time with their families, their neighbors and their communities, and they don’t have to be the victim of a crime because of these illegal aliens that are in our country, victimizing them.”

Earlier this month, DHS said it arrested more than 1,000 people since it started “Operation Midway Blitz” in September. The TRiiBE hasn’t verified those numbers; with the magnitude and sporadic tactics of detainments, it is challenging to track the number of people who have been taken and where exactly they have been taken to.

During today’s press conference, Pritzker highlighted multiple instances of what he refers to as the Trump administration’s “unlawful behavior and abuses of power.” On Oct. 25, federal agents tear-gassed residents in Old Irving Park who were there documenting enforcement actions. In total, three people were detained by federal agents, and two were U.S. citizens.

An annual children’s costume party in Old Irving Park was scheduled to take place on Oct. 25, but the parade was interrupted and later canceled, Pritzker said.

“This year, the parade was interrupted and then canceled, not because of rain, but because of tear gas. Federal agents swarmed into the neighborhood, not with a criminal target in their sights, but just because Old Irving Park was the next neighborhood on their list to terrorize,” Pritzker said.

Last Saturday was the fourth day in a row that federal agents deployed tear gas. They did so in Cicero, Little Village and in Lakeview, as well.

During his remarks, Pritzker also called out CBP Commander Gregory Bovino and said the operation has “sown fear, division and chaos.”

“If you are unwilling to cease operations and leave our city, can we at least agree that our children should not be victims, especially on Halloween?” Pritzker said. Can we agree that there is no imminent threat that should disrupt their holiday? No child in America should have to go trick-or-treating in fear that they might be confronted with armed federal agents and have to inhale tear gas. I honestly can’t even believe that I have to make this plea. This is not the America that I know. I ask you to restore some sanity for the sake of our children.”

This week, Bovino was called to testify in federal court about a video showing him throwing tear gas in Little Village, as well as other alleged violations of a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued.

Also at the press conference were Illinois State Representative Norma Hernandez (D-77), Latino Policy Forum president and CEO Linda Xóchitl Tortolero, Principal of Lords Park Elementary School in Elgin Noe Velazquez, and a representative from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. They highlighted the trauma and toll that the intensified immigration enforcement has had on not only immigrant communities but every community across the state.

“These actions are not just traumatizing, but they are destabilizing our economy, hurting small businesses and even impacting school attendance and fear is not a policy solution,” Hernandez said. “Trauma is not public safety, and no level of government, local, state or federal, should be allowed to terrorize the very people they’re supposed to serve.”

Hernandez added that rapid responders, legal observers, journalists, elected officials and other volunteers are being arrested when they document federal agents’ misconduct and illegal tactics.

On Wednesday, half a dozen Chicago-area political figures were named in a felony indictment and are being charged with felony impeding and impeding conspiracy charges. The charges stem from a Sept. 26 protest outside the ICE processing center in Broadview. The six people include Democratic Illinois 9th District congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, Cook County Democratic committeeman Michael Rabbitt and Chicago Ald. Andre Vasquez’s Chief of Staff Catherine Sharp.

“They are getting more aggressive, more violent and attacking more people who pose no threat to them,” Hernandez said.",https://media.thetriibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30114854/Halloween-in-Hyde-Park-x-Ash-Lane-x-Oct-31-2024_42-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:05.624974

Many have been in the United States for years and have established deep roots in their communities.
Throwing such people out is a disservice to them, but also to the nation, Archbishop Wenski suggested.
“Home is here,” Archbishop Wenski said.
“The Biden administration gave humanitarian visas to about half a million people from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba,” Archbishop Wenski said.","Miami’s Archbishop Thomas Wenski understands in his bones the plight of today’s immigrants. He can draw on his own experience as the child of a Polish immigrant with family roots in the immigrant stronghold of Detroit as well as his unique perspective as a pastoral leader in a part of the country that has been powerfully redefined by the immigrant experience.

In an online forum sponsored by Jesuit Refugee Service USA on Oct. 28, Archbishop Wenski recalled how unwelcome Haitian immigrants had initially been in South Florida and when Cuban immigrants fell from grace following the infamous Mariel Boatlift in 1980.

“What the ’80s taught me…was that immigration was not a threat, but an opportunity because certainly South Florida, especially Miami, has benefited tremendously from immigration,” he said in a conversation with Don Kerwin, JRS vice president.

American dreamers

Like other immigrant groups that came to the United States, the Haitians and Cubans arriving in Miami, he said, were standouts in their homelands, people ready to work hard for their piece of the American dream. In their time, they contributed mightily to the transformation of South Florida—and now their children and grandchildren hold up the region’s health care, real estate and hospitality industries, pursuing advanced degrees and professions their immigrant parents and grandparents could only have dreamed about.

He sees many examples of immigrant success stories in these families. “You could say that immigrants in general—and this has been my experience with Haitians—are almost driven to succeed because they’re risk takers, they’re the decision makers,” Archbishop Wenski said.

“They decided, ‘I can’t take this anymore in Haiti,’ and they took the risk,” he said.

“And this American society of ours rewards people that can make decisions and take risks. So the Haitians, like other immigrant groups, have taken advantage of the opportunities that are provided by America and by freedom to succeed here.”

What a terrible mistake it would be to thwart a process that has been instrumental in the American success story, he suggested. “Originally they were going after the worst of the worst, but the numbers weren’t high enough,” Archbishop Wenski said of the Trump administration’s clampdown, “so they started picking up people that were sitting in the back of a pickup truck as they were leaving lawns that they were cutting in the suburbs.”

“We have to press Congress to change the laws, but we also have to approach the president” and tell him “that he should take a victory lap for having controlled the border” and removing the “worst of the worst” from U.S. communities, he said. Now, the president, he said, has the opportunity to “pivot” from a deportation campaign that has been sowing chaos and anxiety across the country.

There are signs that the Trump administration may be far from the reversal that the archbishop seeks. On Oct. 28, top leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices were abruptly deposed, replaced in many instances by Customs and Border Protection staff in a major shake-up that analysts said would mean even more aggressive deportation tactics. In May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Fox News the Trump administration’s hope is to make “a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day” with an annual goal of 1 million deportations.

That plan will only frustrate the administration’s other goals, Archbishop Wenski warned.

“The president has always said that he wants to have the biggest economy ever,” he said. “If you’re gonna have the biggest economy ever in the United States, you’re not going to do it without the labor force participation of the migrants.”

Catholics: Remember who you are, where you come from

According to Pew Research, more than 14 million people with irregular status are resident in the United States, the numbers spiking sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic. Pew researchers say a record 7.5 million U.S. households included unauthorized immigrants in 2023.

Almost 70 percent of these households are considered “mixed status,” meaning that they also contain U.S.-born residents or lawful immigrants. Most of the U.S.-born residents are children of unauthorized immigrants, Pew reports.

Over decades of inaction on immigration reform, the issue of residency has become muddled for generations of immigrants. Cut off from legal immigration channels by laws that have not adapted to changing conditions, millions have indeed been arriving irregularly. Many have been in the United States for years and have established deep roots in their communities. Throwing such people out is a disservice to them, but also to the nation, Archbishop Wenski suggested.

“Home is here,” Archbishop Wenski said. “There’s no ‘home’ [for deportees] to go back to, and that’s really where the inhumanity of a mass deportation comes up, because after being here all these years, you start forging connections with this host country: You get married; you have kids; you might have kids that are American citizens; you have a spouse that may be a legal permanent resident or American citizen. And all this is going to be thrown into chaos because of [our] antiquated laws.”

And many flippantly described as “illegal” by media commentators and actors in the Trump administration are nothing of the sort, Archbishop Wenski said. They have been residing and working in the United States under humanitarian parole, Temporary Protected Status or while asylum claims or residency applications have slowly made their way through an overwhelmed system.

“The Biden administration gave humanitarian visas to about half a million people from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba,” Archbishop Wenski said. “You could argue about whether that was a smart move or not, but half a million people came here. They were sponsored by somebody in the United States. They had to pay their own transportation here, and they got work permits for two years.”

“Now, the administration is saying that [when] the two years are up; they’re not going to renew [protected status]. They’re going to have to go back. But none of those people were ever a day illegally here in this country.”

And how, he wonders, can any American seriously suggest returning those who have been legitimately offered a refuge in the United States to the chaos and oppression of the failing nations they have fled? “They’ve continued to deport people to Haiti, which is a stateless country right now,” the archbishop said. “They’re deporting people to Cuba, which is in an economic crisis, besides the politics of the whole place, and Nicaragua, which is a country that has deported priests and religious sisters and clamped down on the church there, a very repressive country.”

“They want to deport people there; it doesn’t make sense.”

The U.S. church should continue to keep the issue of comprehensive immigration reform and steps toward rationalizing immigration policy before the U.S. public and its political leadership, Archbishop Wenski said. He urged Congress to reassert its authority over immigration policy and finally address the inadequacies created by decades of inattention.

Simply harmonizing the immigration registry, last updated in 1986 with a cut-off date of Jan. 1, 1972, to current realities could address the status of the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants, he said. He recalled that his own father was able to formalize his residency in the United States through the registry when it was updated in 1929.

It is “Congress that makes the law, and Congress should change the laws,” he said. “We need to focus on Congress to address this issue because every time Congress had an opportunity to do something about immigration over the past 20, 25 years, they always decided to kick the can down the road when the pressure was taken off of them.”

He reminded contemporary Catholics that the history of the American church is intrinsically bound with the continuing phenomenon of immigration. Catholics “should remember where we come from,” he said, “who we are.”

There are few Catholics in this country that are not “maybe a generation removed from the immigration experience,” he said. Noting a surge of neo-nativist ideology and rhetoric, he added, “Catholics have to be careful that they’re not swept up by people who are masking their anti-Catholicism with an anti-immigration stance.”

Trump’s refugee cap is the lowest since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, which codified a formal process for admitting and relocating refugees to the US.
The US Refugee Act allows presidents to set a cap on the number of annual refugee admissions, but there is no bottom limit.
That order also prioritised humanitarian relief, including refugee admissions, to white South Africans, on the basis that they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.
The first plane carrying white South Africans admitted under the new programme landed in the US in May.","Washington, DC – United States President Donald Trump has announced the lowest refugee admission cap in the country’s history, limiting entry to just 7,500 people for the fiscal year 2026.

In a presidential document published on Thursday but dated September 30, the Trump administration indicated that the US refugee system would remain largely closed to the millions of people around the world fleeing unsafe conditions.

Instead, priority for the 7,500 available slots would be given to white Afrikaners from South Africa.

“The admissions numbers shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204 and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands,” the document said.

Trump has repeatedly said white South Africans are being persecuted in the Black-majority country, a claim rejected by South Africa’s government and top Afrikaner officials.

Thursday’s filings also indicated that the Trump administration would narrow the groups that handle refugee services moving forward.

Refugee resettlement grants and contracts that currently go to an array of public and private organisations will instead be rerouted to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.

“The transfer ensures better alignment of resources, oversight, and accountability [of] resettlement activities that take place entirely within the United States,” a separate declaration said.

Trump’s refugee cap is the lowest since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, which codified a formal process for admitting and relocating refugees to the US.

Since then, at least two million refugees have arrived through the US Refugee Admissions Program or USRAP. Trump sought to suspend the programme upon taking office, prompting a successful legal challenge from immigrant rights groups.

Thursday’s cap of 7,500 is only a fraction of the 125,000 refugees allowed to enter under former President Joe Biden during his final year in office. The new, lower cap is set to last from October 2025 through September 2026.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently 42.7 million refugees globally.

The US Refugee Act allows presidents to set a cap on the number of annual refugee admissions, but there is no bottom limit. That has long sparked concerns that Trump, who slashed admissions during his first term, could effectively grind USRAP to a halt.

‘Downfall for a crown jewel’

In a post on the social media platform X, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted that Trump’s declaration appeared to shift the definition of whom Washington considers to be a refugee.

“Trump’s new refugee determination appears to call for admitting refugees who wouldn’t meet the definition of refugee — someone who faces persecution (not ‘discrimination’) on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” he wrote.

He added that, for decades, the US refugee programme has admitted “people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors”.

“Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,” he said. “What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”

The International Refugee Assistance Project, meanwhile, said that Trump did not appear to follow the required congressional consultation process before announcing the cap. The group dismissed the move as baldly political.

“Today’s announcement highlights just how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world,” the organisation’s president, Sharif Aly, said in a statement.

“America’s refugee program was built to reflect our values, and the thousands of individuals we’ve closed our doors to represent thousands of missed opportunities of people who could have strengthened a local community or economy,” the statement said.

Trump’s declaration did not give a reason for the massive cut in refugee admissions, saying only that the number was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.

The US president has led a massive crackdown on all forms of immigration since taking office, but some advocates had hoped that the refugee programme — which historically had broad bipartisan support — might be spared.

The cross-aisle support has been buoyed in recent years by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many politicians supporting pathways to immigration for Afghans who worked alongside the US military or allied forces and companies.

Many Afghans have relied on the refugee programme while other specialised immigration programmes remain constricted or backlogged.

Since taking office for a second term, Trump, however, has focused heavily on white Afrikaners. In February, for instance, Trump issued Executive Order 14204 to cut aid to South Africa, on the basis that it demonstrated “shocking disregard” for Afrikaners.

That order also prioritised humanitarian relief, including refugee admissions, to white South Africans, on the basis that they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released new statistics on violent threats against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement officers who are now facing an 8,000% increase in death threats against them.

“Our ICE law enforcement is now facing an 8,000% increase in death threats against them while they risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families. Make no mistake, sanctuary politicians are contributing to the surge in violent threats and assaults of our officers through their repeated vilification and demonization tactics, including gross comparisons to the Nazi Gestapo. This violence against law enforcement must end.”

Disturbingly, in recent days, ICE officers’ family members have been doxed and threatened, and had bounties placed on their heads for their murders. Below are a handful of violent threats made against ICE law enforcement officers recently:

Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrest of Eduardo Aguilar, an illegal alien from Mexico residing in Dallas, Texas, after he posted on TikTok in Spanish soliciting the murder of ICE agents. Aguilar’s post from October 9, 2025, called for “10 dudes in Dallas with determination who aren’t afraid to [two skull emojis],” and offered “10K for each ICE agent.”

In Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse received a call saying, “I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”

A separate voicemail left on an ICE employee’s phone was also discovered this month, where a caller states, “I hope every one of those lawless c**** you call ICE officers gets doxxed one by one.”

On October 24, 2025, ICE also became aware of a potential officer safety threat based on a Facebook post from a man named James Adrian Warren. On October 22, 2025, the individual shared posts that threatened ICE officers. The post specifically targets the Ferndale, Washington ICE office and he calls ICE “Nazi’s” and “The Gestapo.” The man also says he will begin observing, tailing, recording and reporting ICE employees to “make life harder for ICE here in Whatcom County.”

While there is bipartisan support for standalone bills that would fund SNAP through the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.)
The judge has handled several high-profile disputes since President Donald Trump was sworn in to a second term in January.","Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states sued the Trump administration earlier this week over its decision not to tap emergency funds for SNAP.

“Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” state officials wrote in the lawsuit. “Worse still, USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits.”

The Trump administration has insisted that the contingency fund is reserved for emergencies such as natural disasters and does not have enough money to supply the roughly $8 billion needed for benefits next month.

Partially funding SNAP would be “disastrous,” Jason Altabet, the Justice Department’s lawyer, argued Thursday. States would have to figure out how to administer partial benefits — potentially just to turn around and begin administering full benefits should Congress reach a government funding deal, he added.

But Talwani challenged that argument, saying she believed Congress’ intention in setting aside emergency funds for the program was to “protect the American people.”

Even if Congress agrees on a funding patch for the program, logistical and administrative delays will likely prevent the money from flowing immediately. While there is bipartisan support for standalone bills that would fund SNAP through the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said he won’t bring them to a floor vote — an attempt to keep pressure high on Democrats for a full reopening of the government.

Without SNAP, food banks and other emergency feeding organizations have said they are unprepared to bridge the gap. Officials in states like Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Hawaii and Minnesota have announced plans to tap state and local funds to provide food aid and assist food banks in the interim.

Talwani acknowledged Thursday that, “absent a 100 percent win” for the plaintiffs, millions of SNAP recipients would lose their benefits on Nov. 1.

The judge has handled several high-profile disputes since President Donald Trump was sworn in to a second term in January.

In April, Talwani blocked a Trump administration effort to strip more than half a million Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan immigrants of immigration parole status granted during the Biden administration. The Supreme Court halted her order the next month, without explanation.

In July, Talwani blocked enforcement of a provision in a Trump-backed budget law that sought to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. She said the move unconstitutionally targeted the organization. However, last month, an appeals court stayed her ruling, allowing the administration to enforce the funding ban for now.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd3%2F2e%2Fc01b881a43d69e0fd76c6cf91555%2Fgovernment-shutdown-food-aid-78738.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 15:56:54.356088

The change marks a substantial shift from the Biden administration’s EAD policy, which allowed many renewal applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiration of the permit while their renewal application was pending with USCIS.
Employers and authorized workers must note that, under the new rules, merely filing a timely renewal application is no longer sufficient in some categories to continue working after the card’s expiration date.
An authorized worker’s EAD renewal application must first be approved by USCIS to be actually extended or renewed.
“It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” Director Edlow explained in the USCIS’s announcement.","DHS this week announced an interim final rule (IFR) that will end its policy of automatically extending employment authorization documents (EADs – work permits) for certain renewal applicants. The change marks a substantial shift from the Biden administration’s EAD policy, which allowed many renewal applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiration of the permit while their renewal application was pending with USCIS.

Some exceptions to this policy still apply. For example, automatic extension provisions tied to certain statutory requirements or Federal Register notices (such as those for Temporary Protected Status‐based EADs) may remain in force.

Employers and authorized workers must note that, under the new rules, merely filing a timely renewal application is no longer sufficient in some categories to continue working after the card’s expiration date. An authorized worker’s EAD renewal application must first be approved by USCIS to be actually extended or renewed. Employers must terminate the employment of workers whose EADs expire while renewals are pending.

USCIS emphasized that by requiring a full adjudication before extending work authorization or renewing the document, the agency is “placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting … [and] Eliminating policies … that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security.”

Immigration Enforcement Implications

This regulation change may allow the Trump administration to more quickly enforce immigration laws, particularly with regard to those who entered the United States illegally but were given work permits via grants of parole or have received some form of prosecutorial discretion, like deferred action.

Aliens in other categories who become removable may also face more exposure to immigration officers if their EADs expire. While this policy change by itself does not create any new enforcement authorities, it removes a bureaucratic buffer that previously gave tens of thousands of aliens cover while their renewal applications were pending before USCIS. Their records, if their EAD validity period lapses, will show as “unauthorized” in DHS systems (such as SAVE, E-Verify, PCQS, and related systems) earlier and ICE will have fewer administrative obstacles in initiating or executing removals.

Categories – especially parole-based or deferred action EADs – could also now lose their protection from enforcement more quickly if USCIS does not automatically renew their EAD and decides to deny a renewal application, which has always been subject to USCIS discretion. When employment authorization lapses, it can also trigger status reviews or end discretionary parole or deferred action, especially if the status depends on continuing EAD eligibility. That, in turn, may allow DHS to issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) sooner given current U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) goals.

USCIS Director Joseph Edlow explained that the agency is rescinding the Biden administration’s automatic EAD renewal policy to allow the agency to properly verify the applicants’ eligibility and confirm the absence of fraud or other security concerns. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” Director Edlow explained in the USCIS’s announcement. Moreover, the rule’s Federal Register notice explained:

The automatic extension of the validity of an EAD grants the benefit of extending an alien’s expired EAD and/or employment authorization merely by filing a timely renewal EAD application and without first completing adjudicative review and related vetting, including resolution of derogatory information identified during the vetting process. That is, it grants the benefit without an eligibility determination; without completing vetting and screening checks; without resolving potential hits of derogatory information; and, when applicable, without a determination that the employment authorization should be granted in the exercise of discretion. Without this IFR, aliens could still obtain an automatic extension despite derogatory information that could flag them as a national security or public safety risk. As described above, vetting and screening might not be completed and derogatory information reviewed and resolved before the alien’s EAD expires. The automatic extension, therefore, poses a security vulnerability that could allow bad actors to continue to work and generate income to potentially finance nefarious activities that pose an imminent threat to the American public. Granting benefits without proper vetting and full adjudication is contrary to the mission of DHS and poses a threat to the safety and security of the American people.

In its press release, USCIS recommended that eligible aliens seeking a timely renewal of their EAD should properly file a renewal application early, up to 180 days before their EAD expires. “The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation.”

What Was in Place Before the IFR

The IFR was issued to repeal the December 2024 regulation, issued under the Biden administration, that increased the automatic extension period for certain employment authorization document renewal applicants for both employment authorization (for aliens who are authorized incident to status) and EADs (for aliens who must apply for work authorization documents) from up to 180 days to up to 540 days from the expiration date stated on expiring Form I-766 if they have a timely filed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As a result of that 2024 rulemaking, the 540-day automatic extension became available to:

Asylum applicants and grantees;

Refugees;

Parents or dependent children of lawful permanent residents (green card holders);

Aliens who have applied for, and aliens who have been granted, withholding of removal;

Certain TPS applicants;

TPS recipients;

Spouses of E-1/2/3 nonimmigrant visa holders;

Spouses of L-1 nonimmigrant visa holders; certain aliens who have filed lawful permanent resident (green card) applications;

Aliens who have filed applications for suspension of deportation, cancellation of removal, or special rule cancellation of removal; aliens who have filed applications for creation of record of lawful admission for permanent residence;

Aliens who have filed applications to legalize under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA);

Alien spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders; and

Aliens who are the principal beneficiaries or derivative children of approved VAWA self-petitioners.

The Biden administration’s stated justification for codifying the automatic extension as a regulation in 2024 was to address USCIS’s inability to keep up with its workload (indefinitely, rather than on an as-needed basis, which the agency had done previously in the form of issuing temporary rules). In addition to financial shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and litigation, the Biden administration’s border policies, historic expansion of TPS, and abuse of parole played a significant role in limiting the agency’s ability to manage its finances and adjudicative capacity in recent years. These policies created “[a]n additional contributing factor… a substantial and sustained increase in initial and renewal EAD applications which significantly increased renewal EAD processing times.”

The agency stated then that processing times “increased to such a level that the 180-day automatic extension for certain pending renewal EAD applications under 8 CFR 274a.13(d) was insufficient to prevent many renewal applicants from experiencing a lapse in employment authorization and/or documentation while their renewal applications remained pending with USCIS”. At that time, the agency estimated that if the agency did not automatically extend EAD validity periods, “approximately 800,000 renewal applicants would have been in danger of losing their employment authorization and/or documentation in the period beginning May 2024 and ending March 2026”.

Processing times for EADs, however, have improved. For the month of September 2025, USCIS reported an average processing time of 3.7 months for the Form 765, Application for Employment Authorization.

Opportunity to comment

While DHS’s new policy will go into effect immediately, the agency is accepting comments on the interim final rule through the end of November (or 30 days after official publication in the Federal Register).

During the comment period, members of the public can submit feedback, including support, opposition, or relevant policy alternatives, through regulations.gov or directly on the federal register’s website. Generally, all comments are publicly available for review, and agencies must review and respond to all relevant comments before it can finalize the regulation. All comments must include the agency name (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) and the docket number (DHS Docket No. USCIS-USCIS-2025-0271) for this rulemaking.

Public comments give individuals, organizations, and experts the opportunity to provide the government with real-world perspectives, data, and feedback that agencies may not otherwise have considered. By highlighting potential impacts, gaps, or improvements, these comments can influence how final policies are written and implemented.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/EAD2.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 17:01:24.324249

(Warning: This video contains violence and strong language.)

Durango Police Chief Brice Current requested the investigation, CBI said in a statement.

CBI will investigate whether the agent violated state criminal law during the Tuesday incident during a protest over the arrest of a Colombian man, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, and his 12-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son while on their way to school.

The family’s active asylum case is pending. Jaramillo-Solano has lived in Colorado for 18 months and has no criminal history, advocates with Compañeros Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center said.

Once the probe is completed, CBI’s findings will be presented to the 6th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

The district attorney will decide whether to file criminal charges.

The woman the agent confronted, Franci Stagi, told The Colorado Sun on Thursday she is “incredibly sore” with pain in her upper back, neck and head.

Stagi was protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office early Tuesday when she saw an unmarked car pull up about 6:15 a.m.

She began recording on her phone and asked an officer, “You’re a good Christian, aren’t you?”

“Boy, did that piss him off,” Stagi told The Sun on Tuesday, shortly after it happened. The officer, who was wearing a black vest with “police” printed on it, knocked her phone out of her hands and she tried to grab it back.

Stagi said the officer then yelled, “She’s assaulting me!” before grabbing Stagi by her hair. He put her in a chokehold and pushed her to the ground over a grassy embankment, where she landed on her head, according to a video of the interaction.

It was not clear through the video which federal agency the officer worked for. The agent did not attempt to place Stagi under arrest and let her leave after the encounter.

Because the incident happened on federal property, the FBI is also looking into the incident, Durango city officials said Wednesday. An email to an FBI spokesperson in Denver was not immediately answered Wednesday.

“During the current lapse in appropriations, FBI operations are directed toward national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions,” the agency said in an automated email.

ICE’s arrests of Jaramillo-Solano and his children Monday have drawn backlash from the local community and state officials.

Gov. Jared Polis said his office was not informed of the operation, nor was it provided any information about whether Jaramillo-Solano and his children were suspected of any crimes.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and in the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he said Wednesday in a post on social media. “The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families.”

A community meeting about the protests with Durango city officials is set for 4 p.m. today.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling.
Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program.","The Trump administration is drastically cutting the number of refugees it will admit to the U.S., capping it at 7,500 for the current fiscal year. That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.

The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification in the Federal Register filed on Thursday, and ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.""

The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S. since March.

In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have shuttered their services, changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process.

Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare.

Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, previously told reporters that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. ""At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.""

The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025.

Push for higher caps

Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S.

""It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,"" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap.

The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced sharp budget, resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office.

Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance the Afrikaners are poised to receive.

PEN America said these deceptive information practices are eroding trust in government information that the public depends on and must end.

In response, Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, issued the following statement:

“It is becoming starkly clear that under this administration, information provided by the government may be misleading or flat-out wrong, intended to build public support for policies not shaped on their merits, but through selective or manipulated content. Certainly, both Democratic and Republican administrations have routinely infused politics into their communications, but the deceptive messaging tactics seen in recent months stand in clear contrast to the past. Federal government data and information have long been a reliable source for credible information for journalists, researchers, and the public. But increasingly, public confidence and trust in these sources is being eroded. These practices must end — the administration should be honoring the public’s right to the truth, rather than peddling falsehoods.”

The Washington Post’s reporting coincides with a new Pew Research Center analysis that found about half of Americans say it’s difficult to determine what’s true and what’s not when they get news. It comes alongside the growth of generative AI to create content, and social media amplification for distribution. The misleading videos also follow earlier moves by the administration to restrict data and research on topics of public interest that don’t align with its agenda, often with a focus on topics such as health, gender, education, and climate.

The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.
The government memo said only that the admission of the 7,500 refugees during 2026 fiscal year was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.
The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law that allegedly targets Afrikaners’ land.

The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.

The administration published the news on Thursday in a notice on the Federal Registry.

No reason was given for the drop in numbers, which are a dramatic decrease from last year’s ceiling set under the Biden administration of 125,000.

The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.

The government memo said only that the admission of the 7,500 refugees during 2026 fiscal year was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.

The figure had previously been reported after documents about the plans were leaked.

The announcement swiftly drew criticism from refugee organizations, with the International Refugee Assistance Project saying: “This determination makes it painfully clear that the Trump administration values politics over protection.”

“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program. It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,” it added.

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, CEO of the US-based Global Refuge, took issue with the ethics of the decision.

She said: “This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing. For more than four decades, the US refugee program has been a lifeline for families fleeing war, persecution, and repression. At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council posted on X.

He wrote: “Since the US Refugee Program was created in 1980, it has admitted over two million people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors. Now it will be used as a pathway for white immigration. What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”

In February, Trump signed an executive order to cut financial aid to South Africa after he accused its Black-led government of “unjust racial discrimination” to white Afrikaners, a minority group who are descendants of Dutch and French colonial settlers.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law that allegedly targets Afrikaners’ land.

The South African government has pushed back, calling the claims false as well as denying US accusations that Afrikaners are being subjected to racially motivated violence in rural areas.

Across South Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by white individuals, who make up 7.3% of the total population of the country, according to Action for Southern Africa. Meanwhile, Black Africans, who make up 81.4% of the country’s population, only own around 4% of the land.

Thursday’s announcement is not the first time Trump has slashed refugee resettlement numbers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c867ab86734f09127f9dfacce0914e6077435e3d/557_0_4671_3736/master/4671.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79f838663bec1126a4597af7648bb7df",N,,2025-10-30 18:01:09.121196

The civil case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado against top officials at the Department of Homeland Security represents four immigrants who were, or still are, detained in Colorado while awaiting deportation hearings. They are seeking class action status.

At issue, the ACLU and other attorneys argue, is that under federal law immigration agents are not granted unfettered authority to make warrantless arrests. In order to detain someone without a warrant signed by a judge, an agent must have probable cause to believe the person being arrested is in the United States in violation of immigration laws and likely to flee and escape before a warrant can be obtained.

ACLU lawyers say their four plaintiffs’ stories, while all different, represent a pattern in the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operate in Colorado.

The four people were arrested and detained without a warrant and without any public evaluation that they were likely to flee before a warrant could be obtained. The four have lived in their communities for years and have long histories of local employment or schooling, and present no likelihood of escape, let alone probable cause for a crime, their lawyers argued in the suit.

One of the plaintiffs is Caroline Dias Goncalves, a University of Utah student who was detained after being stopped on Interstate 70 in Mesa County. She was brought to the United States from Brazil as a child and was in the United States on an expired tourist visa. She had no criminal record when she was detained for more than two weeks. Goncalves has since been released.

The plaintiffs attorneys are seeking a preliminary injunction in a two-day scheduled hearing in front of U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson.

Lawyers for the government said in filings that the preliminary injunction would enable the ACLU attorneys to assume control over certain ICE operations in Colorado relating to arrests, training and reporting and that would be inappropriate.

The federal government acknowledges in court documents that although “some” warrantless arrests occur, Denver ICE agents usually conduct targeted operations to arrest undocumented immigrants with warrants. These operations, the federal government said in a court filing, primarily focus on immigrants with final removal orders or serious criminal history.

They also told the court that the Department of Homeland Security agents are trained to assess flight risk of the people they’re detaining. They’re “expected to evaluate, through a consensual encounter, whether there is reason to believe that the person may be in the United States unlawfully as well as whether the person poses a flight risk,” government lawyers said in court documents.

“Determining whether there was a reason to believe an alien was likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained is a nuanced inquiry,” the documents said.

The government also noted that the plaintiffs in the ACLU’s case are not likely to be subject to unlawful warrantless arrests in the future because ICE now has arrest warrants signed by judges for all four of them.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/CPR-ICE-RAID-20250205-07.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:29.388383

ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible.
But the work of advocates and journalists like Wilson exposes much about the true face of ICE Air.","The perpetrators of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration are allergic to transparency.

The most widely recognized symptom of this condition is their habit of masking up. The face-covering gaiter has quickly become a shameful icon for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who’ve terrorized countless communities across Colorado and the country.

But ICE and its partners in the lawless implementation of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program mask up in other ways. As Newsline reporter Sara Wilson recently discovered, the numerous daily flights that crisscross the country to transport immigrants are difficult to track.

That’s by design.

The flights are run by ICE, which transports people to immigration detention hubs and out of the country to deport them. The operation balloons the catastrophe of detention by putting whole states between family members and undercutting the ability of detainees to seek legal help.

Think of how a normal criminal prosecution works. A person is arrested on suspicion of violating the law by uniformed, identifiable police officers. That person is booked at a local facility and possibly jailed, but in many cases they have the opportunity to secure pre-trial release, and in all cases they’re given access to legal representation.

Compare that to how faceless, unaccountable immigration officers grab residents off the street and whisk them to locations unknown to family and friends. Most people whom ICE arrests in Colorado have no criminal conviction or charge, and that tracks with the national trend. Despite constitutional rights that are supposed to protect them, they have little expectation of due process or access to legal representation.

ICE flights are a major component of this injustice.

Wilson reported that Colorado-based Key Lime Air, which many customers know as Denver Air Connection, in mid-September started running daily flights of detainees for ICE. Key Lime is the first known Colorado-based company to participate in ICE Air, the agency’s program of removal and domestic transfer flights on charter and commercial airlines.

Key Lime aircraft shuttle detainees around the country, and they frequent ICE detention hubs, particularly El Paso and Harlingen in Texas, and Alexandria, Louisiana. As part of reporting the story, Newsline journalists observed dozens of detainees exit and enter Key Lime aircraft with their hands and feet shackled.

The reporting didn’t come easy. The Key Lime planes that perform ICE Air work are devoid of company logos. The company appears to have blocked the planes’ registration numbers from at least one popular flight tracking website. When they started ferrying detainees they stopped using the Key Lime flight communication call sign, “LYM.”

Federal authorities communicate very little about the flights. We don’t know the identity of the passengers. And Key Lime was no help. Wilson had a door shut in her face at Key Lime headquarters at Centennial Airport, and when she got CEO Cliff Honeycutt on the phone he quickly ended the conversation.

Much of what is known about ICE flights comes from independent trackers, like Washington-based La Resistencia, and immigration advocates. The New York Times relied on a flight database created by refugee advocate Tom Cartwright when it published an investigation into the Alexandria deportation hub. The Guardian‘s investigation into the hub, which features a detention center on the airport tarmac, found “a pattern of alleged due process violations … neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays.”

“There is almost no legal access to the center,” the Guardian reported.

ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible. And the result is the same: Malign government agents defy transparency and accountability.

Under the May 15 data-sharing agreement, which was posted recently on the Social Security Administration’s website, the system added information, including full Social Security numbers, on millions of Americans not in DHS databases.
That’s because multiple audits and analyses have shown that SSA’s citizenship information is often outdated or incomplete, especially for people who became naturalized citizens.
As of last month, Homeland Security officials had run more than 33 million voters through SAVE, USCIS told NPR.
Federal officials aren’t done adding data to SAVE.","This year, when states began using an expanded Department of Homeland Security system to check their voter rolls for noncitizens, it was supposed to validate the Trump administration’s push to harness data from across federal agencies to expose illicit voting and stiffen immigration enforcement.

DHS had recently incorporated confidential data from the Social Security Administration on hundreds of millions of additional people into the tool, known as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system. The added information allowed the system to perform bulk searches using Social Security numbers for the first time.

The initial results, however, didn’t exactly back up President Donald Trump’s contention that noncitizen voting is widespread. Texas identified 2,724 “potential noncitizens” on its rolls, about 0.015% of the state’s 18 million registered voters. Louisiana found 390 among 2.8 million registered voters, a rate of about 0.014%.

Instead, experts say, the sweeping data-sharing agreement authorizing DHS to merge Social Security data into SAVE could threaten Americans’ privacy and lead to errors that disenfranchise legitimate voters.

The details of the agreement, which haven’t previously been reported, show it contains alarmingly few guardrails to ensure accuracy and scant specifics on how the data will be kept secure, election and privacy lawyers who have reviewed it say. Further, it explicitly does not bar DHS from deploying the SSA data for other purposes, including immigration enforcement.

Experts have raised similar concerns about other parts of the Trump administration’s data-pooling drive, which has sought to tap all sorts of traditionally tightly controlled federal information, even tax data.

Until this year, SAVE contained information only on immigrants who’d had contact with DHS, such as those with permanent resident status, and had been assigned immigrant identification numbers. State and local officials typically used the system to verify immigrants’ status when they applied for benefits such as SNAP or to check, one by one, whether individuals who were registering to vote were citizens.

Under the May 15 data-sharing agreement, which was posted recently on the Social Security Administration’s website, the system added information, including full Social Security numbers, on millions of Americans not in DHS databases. The combined dataset joins together this information with addresses, birth dates and criminal records, along with immigration histories.

The agreement allows the SSA’s data to be used for searches to check voters’ citizenship, along with “other authorized inquiries from Federal, State, territorial, tribal and local government agencies seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of individuals within their jurisdiction.”

In doing these searches, SAVE stores not only the voter data that election officials upload but also the outcome of their queries, according to the data-sharing agreement and other documents from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE. The documents do not explain who can access this information or how it can be used.

Experts say adding Social Security data to SAVE could help election officials verify, en masse, if voters are U.S. citizens, but it shouldn’t be used to make final determinations that people aren’t citizens.

That’s because multiple audits and analyses have shown that SSA’s citizenship information is often outdated or incomplete, especially for people who became naturalized citizens. With the 2026 midterms about a year away, Caren Short, director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters of the United States, said she fears the expanded use of SAVE will lead to errors.

“The Trump administration is hunting people to try to purge people from the rolls who are lawfully registered, and they are doing it by looking at unreliable, outdated data,” Short said.

Several privacy lawyers said they believe it’s illegal for DHS to expand the use of SAVE without taking steps required in federal law, such as issuing a system of records notice to inform the public how the additional data will be collected, stored and used. Last month, advocacy groups sued the federal government, alleging that its expansion of SAVE and other data consolidation efforts violate the Privacy Act, a federal law that prohibits public agencies from misusing private information.

Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to answer questions from ProPublica.

In a filing responding to the advocacy groups’ lawsuit, federal officials said that another statute, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that agencies would exercise caution in determining whether voters are noncitizens.

“There is zero basis to assume that State officials have any interest in haphazardly and unlawfully removing large numbers of U.S. citizens from their voter rolls, and no credible evidence that any such thing has happened or is going to happen any time soon” the filing says.

Still, Leland Dudek, acting SSA commissioner until early May, told ProPublica he doesn’t trust that DHS will accurately flag noncitizens as officials try to cross-match data and files from multiple systems.

“They are probably going to make some massive mistakes,” he said.

This summer, the Justice Department started demanding access to state voter registration lists, saying this was necessary to ensure compliance with federal voter roll maintenance laws. The agency has filed lawsuits against a number of states that have refused to comply.

Some of the states that have refused to provide voters’ private information directly to the Justice Department have entered into agreements with DHS under which they upload that same information into the SAVE system.

According to a document obtained by the ACLU, which sued the administration for SAVE-related records, a growing number of states are signing agreements with DHS to use SAVE to vet voter rolls. Ten states had signed such agreements coming into 2025; as of July, another 10 had signed on, the document shows.

As counsel for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit voting rights group, Naomi Gilens specializes in issues related to privacy and technology. Gilens said it’s important for Americans to consider if they want the government — including future administrations, not just this one — to have so much consolidated information on them.

“That is a very invasive picture that starts to be painted, in one place, for every individual who lives here’s private lives,” she said.

As of last month, Homeland Security officials had run more than 33 million voters through SAVE, USCIS told NPR. So far, the agency has declined to say publicly what the outcome of these queries have been.

But the initial results are tucked into another document obtained by the ACLU.

As of late August, about 96.3% of the voters checked in the SAVE system were identified by the system as U.S. citizens. For an additional 3.1% of voters, the system either couldn’t find them or needed more information to determine their citizenship status. About 0.5% of voters checked had died, the system found. And 0.04% showed up as noncitizens.

According to copies of 12 state agreements with DHS obtained by the ACLU and reviewed by ProPublica, election officials are required to take additional steps to verify SAVE results for voters the system identifies as other than U.S. Citizens. Then, if SAVE still can’t verify citizenship, the election officials “must contact the registrant or registered voter to obtain proof of citizenship.”

Dudek and Kathleen Romig, a former Social Security official who now works at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, worry even those steps won’t be enough to prevent mismatches from happening.

People’s names can be misspelled or listed differently in the various datasets. Many states collect partial, not full, Social Security numbers from voters and matches using partial numbers will be even less accurate, since many people share the same names, Dudek and Romig said.

“If there’s Jane Smith that is a citizen, and a Jane Smith that isn’t, you don’t want to disenfranchise the citizen Jane Smith by accident,” Romig said.

Federal officials aren’t done adding data to SAVE. Next up, according to a recent USCIS presentation to election officials shared with ProPublica: passport information from the State Department. (The State Department referred ProPublica’s request for comment to DHS, which did not respond.)","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/save-voting-data-FINAL_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_quality_95_embedColorProfile_true.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-10-30 14:04:59.307960

Tracking and evaluating the evolution of immigration enforcement, however, will be increasingly difficult without regularly published and reliable data.
At a time when immigration enforcement has been deemed a high federal priority, it is in the national interest for the government to provide transparent, regular, reliable immigration enforcement data.","Unauthorized migration at the U.S.-Mexico border plunged dramatically during the just-ended fiscal year, as the Trump administration leveraged new border controls, further asylum restrictions, and the promise of mass deportations, reaching about 444,000 migrant encounters recorded in fiscal year (FY) 2025. This sharp drop from 2.1 million encounters the prior year was also marked by reversion to a pattern last experienced more than a decade ago: Flows primarily composed of Mexican single adults and Central American unaccompanied children.

The steep decrease in unauthorized arrivals at the border and return to nationalities that are easier to turn back because of existing repatriation agreements has permitted the administration to direct its focus to immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior—in fact deploying significant U.S. Border Patrol assets to cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago. To achieve its goal of mass deportations, the administration has increased coordination among federal agencies, elevated cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies, rapidly accelerated the build-up of detention capacity, expanded the use of fast-track removal powers, tapped the U.S. military, and established new agreements to repatriate returnees to third countries. As a result, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recorded more deportations from within U.S. communities during FY 2025 than the Border Patrol apprehended people crossing the Southwest border illegally—the first time since at least FY 2014, according to available data.

While detailed FY 2025 data about ICE arrests and removals have not been released since January, there is no doubt that interior enforcement has risen. But it has become increasingly complicated to track results because only selective statistics have been made public. Returning to regular reporting of detailed data on immigration enforcement across the various Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration agencies could not only improve the public’s understanding of current immigration enforcement activities but also inform state and local stakeholders who want to collaborate or who are affected by enforcement.

Ramped-Up Interior Enforcement and Mass Deportations

While U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) continues to post border encounter statistics every month, DHS has inconsistently released immigration enforcement data and its last detailed tables of ICE and CBP actions ended with November 2024 activity. Based on the latest publicly available figures, however, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates that ICE conducted about 340,000 deportations in FY 2025, including noncitizens with a formal order of removal and immigration detainees who chose to end their detention with a voluntary departure. This would mark a level of activity 25 percent higher than the 271,000 deportations recorded by ICE in FY 2024. These fiscal year figures do not include deportations conducted by CBP, which DHS has yet to release.

The administration says it conducted more than 400,000 deportations overall between ICE and CBP in its first 250 days, and was on pace to reach nearly 600,000 by the end of its first year. This projection falls short of the 685,000 deportations recorded by the Biden administration in FY 2024—and is well off the Trump administration’s pledge of carrying out 1 million deportations per year.

Location Matters

Where the deportations are happening is significantly different under the Trump administration, with more occurring within the U.S. interior rather than at the border. This has significant operational impacts, given deportations in the interior are likely to be far more resource intensive and carry higher individual and societal costs with enforcement happening in U.S. cities and against people who, unlike many recent border crossers, often have significant years of U.S. residence and deep community ties.

Of the 400,000 deportations conducted by the Trump administration through its first 250 days, MPI estimates approximately 234,000 were conducted by ICE from the U.S. interior, with another 166,000 by CBP.

ICE daily deportations, in fact, doubled from 600 in January to 1,200 since June. ICE deportations have increased as the number of immigrants being placed in detention centers has surged. Since the start of the Trump administration, the average number of noncitizens in ICE detention centers has grown gradually, reaching about 60,000 by the end of FY 2025 (see Figure 1). And by March, most detainees had been arrested by ICE in the interior, not by CBP at the border or through CBP transfer to ICE, as was usually the case under the Biden administration.

Note: Data on immigrant detainees are through September 20, 2025.

Source: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), “FY 2025 ICE Statistics,” updated September 22, 2025.

Among detainees arrested by ICE, a shrinking share had a criminal conviction despite the administration’s pledge of targeting “dangerous criminals” and the “worst of the worst.” About 35 percent of detainees arrested by ICE had a criminal conviction in September 2025 compared to 65 percent in October 2024 (see Figure 2). Meanwhile, the share of detainees with immigration violations but no criminal charges increased from 6 percent in October 2024 to 35 percent in September 2025.

Figure 2. Detainees Arrested by ICE, by Month and Criminality, FY 2025

Note: Data on immigrant detainees are through September 20, 2025.

Once in detention, it is increasingly unlikely that immigrants will be released. The share who were released on bond or under parole or supervision fell from 26 percent in October 2024, at the end of the Biden administration, to 3 percent in September 2025. In fact, 90 percent of those in ICE detention in September 2025 were deported directly from detention, compared to 63 percent of those in an ICE facility in October 2024.

How long a noncitizen spends in ICE detention depends on whether they were arrested by CBP or ICE, as well as their criminal history. The average length of detention for detainees arrested by CBP was 63 days, compared to 44 days if they were arrested by ICE. Immigrants categorized as “other immigration violator” and who were arrested by ICE had a shorter length of detention (32 days) than those with criminal convictions or charges (47 days). It is possible the difference is due to delays in criminal proceedings and/or delays in deporting individuals with criminal convictions or pending charges to their countries of origin.

Trends at the U.S.-Mexico Border

CBP recorded 444,000 migrant encounters at and between ports of entry in FY 2025, down from 2.1 million encounters a year earlier. The 238,000 encounters by the Border Patrol of migrants crossing the border without authorization represent a 55-year low. (The remaining 206,000 were encountered at ports of entry by CBP’s Office of Field Operations.)

Notably, 75 percent of the FY 2025 encounters were recorded in the last four months of the Biden administration. Irregular arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border fell sharply at the start of the Trump administration, continuing a trend that began in January 2024 and accelerated mid-year, and have remained consistently low since. Since February, the Southwest border has seen an average of 11,000 encounters a month. In fact, daily Border Patrol interdictions reached as low as 116 in July—a far cry from the 11,000 recorded on some days during the record arrivals experienced in December 2023.

The Border Patrol effectively ended the practice termed “catch and release,” with only about a dozen encountered migrants released into the United States with notices to appear (NTAs) in immigration court. From February through September, the Border Patrol processed more than 94 percent of migrants it encountered for expedited removal, reinstatement of removal, voluntary return, or ICE detention. As much as this was the result of policy change, it was also due to the Border Patrol’s capacity to more quickly process migrants and transfer them out of its custody given that arrivals fell sharply and returned to the pattern of originating from nearby countries with which the U.S. government has long had repatriation agreements.

While these measures have reduced irregular crossings of migrants of all nationalities and demographic groups, they appear to be especially effective in reducing encounters of families and migrants from countries other than Mexico. Mexicans accounted for 45 percent of Border Patrol encounters in October 2024, a share that rose to 69 percent by September 2025 (see Figure 3). Over the same period, the share of migrants from countries other than Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, or Venezuela fell from 28 percent to 11 percent.

Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), “Nationwide Encounters,” updated October 24, 2025.

Similarly, as the share of “family unit” encounters (CBP’s term for an adult or minor child traveling with a family member) dropped from 27 percent to 12 percent, the share of single adults increased from 63 percent to 79 percent (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. Share of Encounters of Migrants Crossing the U.S-Mexico Border without Authorization, by Month and Demographic Group, FY 2025

This makes today’s migration patterns resemble those of 13 years ago, when most migrants arriving at the border were single adults from Mexico or unaccompanied children from Central America.

The Future of Immigration Enforcement

Whether the Trump administration reaches its goal of 1 million deportations annually or not, it has implemented a vast array of policy and operational changes that have reshaped the direction of immigration enforcement. The infusion of $45 billion from Congress to build new immigrant detention centers and $30 billion to expand enforcement and deportation operations provided under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act alone will transform ICE and further enhance cooperation with state and local law enforcement over the coming years.

Tracking and evaluating the evolution of immigration enforcement, however, will be increasingly difficult without regularly published and reliable data. Instead of releasing detailed tables on immigration enforcement each month, as done under prior administrations, the Trump administration has relied on issuing a constellation of individual statistics in press releases, tweets, and media interviews, which have conflated sources at times. This has made it difficult to verify the administration’s success against its policy objectives as well as the impacts on federal agencies, immigrants, and U.S. communities alike.

In a Wednesday letter to the Trump administration’s top Supreme Court litigator, D. John Sauer, Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and John Moolenaar of Michigan urged the administration to side with the Falun Gong plaintiffs and press the court to allow the lawsuit to go to trial.

Smith co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, while Moolenaar is the chairman of a special China committee set up in the House of Representatives — and both are prominent critics of Beijing’s human rights record. The letter cited an AP investigation last month that showed American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, saying it “underscore(s) the need to deter American firms from supplying technology to facilitate the CCP’s human rights abuses.”

The decision ultimately rests with the Supreme Court whether to hear the challenge brought by Cisco arguing that U.S. law does not permit such a suit. But as part of considering the case the court sought the views of the solicitor general, who represents the U.S. government’s position in oral arguments and proceedings.

The Trump administration’s view on the case will also be of interest to the court because Cisco has argued that the case involves U.S. foreign relations and should be dismissed on those grounds. The solicitor general is expected to file a brief later this year or early next year.

“The allegation that an American tech company custom-designed a tool to facilitate the violent persecution of a religious minority by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a serious one,” the two lawmakers wrote in a letter to Sauer. “We believe the Plaintiffs deserve the chance to prove their claims.”

“We have a longstanding commitment to uphold and respect human rights for all people and if the 2023 ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court stands, it opens the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services,” said a spokesperson for Cisco.

The case has a long and winding history dating back more than a decade.

In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web.

Other presentations reviewed by AP show that Cisco represented Falun Gong material as a “threat” and built out a national information system to track Falun Gong believers. In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that they knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers.

The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn’t liable under those laws, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), but a federal appeals court rejected the company’s arguments in 2023, allowing the case to continue. Now Cisco is asking the Supreme Court to throw out that ruling and stop the lawsuit.

In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. In the case of Cisco, the Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco’s activities involving China took place in the United States.

An AP investigation this week found that the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police and surveillance companies, even as activists warned such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious groups and target minorities.

Going into the long-heralded meeting Thursday between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the sale of U.S. technology to China has been among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake. Trump said after the meeting that China will speak with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia about purchasing their computer chips.

Debate over the sale of technology to China has grown heated, with some arguing for a harder stance.

American companies have pushed back against restrictions, arguing it will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence.

But many national security experts say selling such technology could assist China’s military and intelligence services. The plaintiffs’ lawyers make a similar case, citing Cisco marketing materials in China that promoted routers for use in tanks.

If the Cisco suit is successful, it would signal that American companies can be held liable in some circumstances for abuse of their technologies overseas.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, accuses Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the 1st Amendment. This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks out against them,” Abughazaleh said Wednesday in a video posted to BlueSky.

Protesters have been gathering outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. A message left with her campaign wasn’t immediately returned. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle, the indictment said.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Abughazaleh is running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others have exercised our 1st Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors, and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” Abughazaleh says in the video.

“As scary as all of this is, I have spent my career fighting America’s backslide into fascism,” she says. “I’m not gonna stop now, and I hope you won’t either.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/853a42f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2e%2Fd2%2F5d4f87164f8ca12c90383d75cd55%2F4eddb6fc5b6a4702be7022c3bb390a76.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 14:04:54.917733

Aside from concerns about human rights and dignity, the controversial full-body restraints have also played a role in deaths in some instances. The AP identified at least 12 cases over the last decade where the forceful restraints were identified during the autopsy process as a factor in death.

Neither ICE nor DHS responded to the AP for comment.

Initially, the Agriculture Department signaled in its own public guidance that it would indeed use this contingency money to prevent an interruption to food stamp benefits.
But the Trump administration abruptly reversed course this month, saying that it could not legally drain the available reserves, except in cases of natural disasters.
Late Wednesday, the Trump administration reaffirmed its opposition.
The administration added that it would be “operationally fraught” if the court sided with states, and forced the government to preserve SNAP benefits using emergency reserves.","The Trump administration staunchly defended its decision to stop paying food stamps during the government shutdown, insisting that a range of legal, technical and budgetary constraints would prevent it from providing a tranche of available funds to millions of poor Americans in November.

In a new set of court filings, submitted late Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged that they had billions of dollars left over across multiple federal accounts. The amounts appeared to total more than would be needed to cover the full costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for the next month.

But lawyers for the Justice Department signaled that the administration could not, or would not, use those funds, leaving 42 million food stamp recipients at risk of cuts to their benefits beginning on Nov. 1.

The Trump administration repeatedly argued that there were legal obstacles to transferring existing funds to SNAP, technical hurdles in remitting payments quickly and other budgetary constraints to consider at the Agriculture Department, where the money would originate.

The arguments set the stage for what is likely to be a tense, high-stakes hearing on Thursday morning in Massachusetts, where more than two dozen states have asked a judge to force the Trump administration to reprogram the budget and provision full aid for food stamps before Nov. 1.

In its filings, the Trump administration acknowledged that an interruption to food stamps would create a “difficult situation for millions of Americans,” but it insisted the court did not have the ability to prevent it.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The administration’s refusal to act underscored its broader strategy over the course of a fiscal stalemate that is now in its fifth week. Throughout, President Trump has been willing to reprogram the federal budget, but only selectively, safeguarding programs at the heart of his political agenda while leaving some Americans to face the risk of real harm from the shutdown.

For the roughly one in eight Americans who participate in the food stamp program, the immediate threat is hunger and financial hardship, with SNAP benefits set to disappear starting on Nov. 1. The benefits average around $187 a month, costing the federal government about $8 billion monthly, which lawmakers replenish every year as part of the budget process.

SNAP also maintains a reserve in case of emergencies or shortfalls, and many Democrats and Republicans had encouraged the Trump administration to tap that fund — totaling about $5 billion — in the event the shutdown entered November. Initially, the Agriculture Department signaled in its own public guidance that it would indeed use this contingency money to prevent an interruption to food stamp benefits.

But the Trump administration abruptly reversed course this month, saying that it could not legally drain the available reserves, except in cases of natural disasters. The decision caused broad panic and outcry, and prompted 25 states and the District of Columbia to sue, arguing that the federal government had a legal and moral obligation to provision food aid.

Late Wednesday, the Trump administration reaffirmed its opposition.

Officials told the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts that the law did not allow them to transfer or spend money that Congress had not appropriated, or in ways that lawmakers did not intend. That, they said, precluded many of the avenues that states have suggested for funding SNAP during the shutdown.

The administration added that it would be “operationally fraught” if the court sided with states, and forced the government to preserve SNAP benefits using emergency reserves. Officials said that it could take weeks, in some cases, to provision food stamps this way — and that doing so may leave beneficiaries with only less than half the amount they would normally receive in a month under SNAP.

“Such a partial payment has never been made — and for good reason,” the government said in its filing.

The Trump administration also argued against using a second tranche of funds — roughly $16.8 billion in leftover money for nutrition programs, financed partly by customs collections — to sustain SNAP in November. That same pot of funds had allowed the White House only weeks earlier to prevent an interruption to another low-income federal food assistance program, known as WIC, during the shutdown.

Officials acknowledged this week that there were “several differences” that precluded them from taking the same approach with SNAP. At one point, they argued that it would cut into funds that should be available for child nutrition, forcing Congress to replenish the program later.

“In short, there was no option to simply fund the SNAP program fully without an appropriation,” the government said, adding that the states’ request “portended its own costs and damaging consequences.”

The government’s assertions offered a stark contrast with Mr. Trump’s other actions during the shutdown, which has seen the administration move around billions of dollars to continue paying troops and law enforcement agents, including those assisting the administration’s mass deportations.

Unlike those functions of government, however, SNAP is a program that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have long sought to cut. They sharply restricted the program as part of their recent package of tax cuts, arguing that it was plagued by waste, fraud and abuse.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/30/multimedia/30dc-snap-htkw/30dc-snap-htkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 13:01:19.855593

A woman faces the same felony charge and is considered a fugitive.

U.S. Homeland Security swept into Oxnard the morning of Oct. 29 with a tactical vehicle, tear gas and dozens of federal agents to arrest two people accused of interfering with the immigration raid at Glass House Farms in July.

According to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, agents arrested Isai Carrillo, 31, of Oxnard. He is charged with conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer, stemming from his involvement in protests against the July 10 raid of Glass House, a licensed cannabis grower in Camarillo. Federal agents arrested more than 300 people that day at two Glass House facilities for suspected immigration violations.

Virginia Reyes, 32, also of Oxnard, faces the same felony charge. She was not arrested on Oct. 29 and ""is considered a fugitive,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office stated.

Reyes and Carrillo are siblings, according to the criminal complaint against the two of them, which was filed in federal court on Oct. 28.

The deployment of federal agents on Wednesday drew dozens of protesters. The agents used chemical agents, flash bangs and an armored tactical vehicle to control the crowd.

""It felt like they escalated it,"" said Oxnard City Councilman Gabe Teran, questioning the level of force used. ""It certainly felt like a lot of people to go after a young lady and a young man.”

Siblings accused of obstructing, assaulting officers

According to the criminal complaint against them, Reyes and Carrillo are both affiliated with VC Defensa, a local organization that monitors federal immigration enforcement activity and posts about immigration raids on social media.

On July 10, as federal agents were headed to Glass House Farms in Camarillo, VC Defensa members were on their way, too, and posting alerts to social media about the impending raid before it began.

The criminal complaint against Reyes and Carrillo states that members of VC Defensa gathered farm equipment and barricaded the main entrance to Glass House Farms, forcing federal agents to use a different exit.

According to the complaint, Reyes stopped her car in front of one of the exits to the farm, partially blocking federal agents’ vehicles and slowing them down as they left the site. Other protesters, including Carrillo, then threw rocks at the government vehicles, the complaint states. At least four of the vehicles were damaged and one federal contract employee was injured by shards of glass.

The complaint includes photos from July 10 that show protesters throwing large rocks at the agents’ vehicles from close range. One of the people throwing rocks is identified in the complaint as Carrillo, and one photo shows him getting into the back seat of a car that the complaint says was driven by Reyes.

The complaint states that at least 10 people “acted in concert to impede and assault federal officers and damage government property,” though only Reyes and Carrillo have been charged with any crimes.

“Although not every member or associate of VC Defensa is involved in violations of federal law, several VC Defensa members are involved in conspiracies to impede and assault federal officers during the commission of their duties,” a special agent who investigated the case wrote in an affidavit included in the criminal complaint.

In a statement posted to Instagram on Oct. 29, VC Defensa called the allegations against the group “completely false.”

“This is part of a witch hunt against anyone who uses their First Amendment rights to organize and speak out against ICE’s campaign of terror on immigrant communities,” VC Defensa’s statement says.

Arrest involved 'out of the ordinary' resources

Homeland security notified the Oxnard Police Department at 5:49 a.m. on Oct. 29 that federal agents were serving a warrant in the area of Palm Drive and A Street, near Wilson Park, said Oxnard Police Chief Jason Benites.

Homeland security came with several dozen agents. Oxnard police were ""not involved in this thing,"" Benites said.

Federal agents formed a perimeter around the neighborhood for the operation and brought in an armored rescue vehicle, the chief said.

""That's out of the ordinary,"" he said of the vehicle.

Benites said he and other officers monitored the situation by watching television broadcasts where they saw agents deploy crowd-control measures. The operation ended shortly before 9 a.m., he said.

""We stayed clear of it,"" Benites said. ""Obviously, it's not our operation. We don't have jurisdiction over them.""

People at the scene later in the morning said agents deployed chemical agents on crowds that formed around the perimeter. Some were wiping the chemicals from their faces and others were treating minor wounds suffered in the scuffle.

""The agents used gas as they prepared to depart, reportedly because demonstrators were attempting to block them and impeded their efforts,"" Oxnard Mayor Luis Mc Arthur said in an Instagram post. In an interview, he said the agents' actions created chaos and could have been handled in a way that lessened the impact on the community.

It appeared at least four people and at least one minor were placed in zip ties during the action, said Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of the 805 UndocuFund group that operates a response network to immigration enforcement actions.

""The fact that children were placed in zip ties is alarming,"" Hernandez said. She questioned the tactics and the number of agents depoyed to A Street.

""This wasn't about detaining two people,"" she said. ""This was about terrorizing the community, and no one should stand by this level of violence.""

Oxnard Union High School District officials said a Pacifica High School student was detained in the action and later released. The student is a U.S. citizen, they said.

“This incident did not occur on campus or near any Oxnard Union High School District school,” they said in a email to families.

The arrest happened near the downtown Oxnard offices of The Arc of Ventura County, a nonprofit that provides services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Esther Anaya, The Arc's executive director, said she got a call at 7 a.m. from a program manager with the organization, who told her federal agents had taped off the street and blocked access to The Arc's building.

About 70 disabled people were expected at The Arc at around 8 a.m. Anaya called the organization's transportation provider and rerouted everyone to The Arc's location in Ventura.

""We were making sure the people we support and the people we employ are safe,"" she said.

Anaya said she was tear-gassed later as federal agents deployed chemical agents against protesters.

""We have masks because of COVID, so I asked the staff that were here to get me as many boxes as they could so we could hand them out to the people who were here, protesting, peacefully, legally, as is their right under the Constitution,"" she said.

Teran, the Oxnard city council member, said he came to the north perimeter of the action at about 6:30 a.m., part of a crowd that grew to about 60 people. He said he saw agents taking photos and videos of the crowd and exhibiting what he called unprofessionalism and poor conduct.

He plans to express his concerns to ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility. The councilman, who also came to the Glass House scene on July 10, said he also worries about the future.

“I don’t see a pathway that is going to have things get any better,” he said. “I only see further escalation of tactics and how they approach this as a federal agency.”","https://www.vcstar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/29/PVCS/86967529007-raid.jpg?crop=827,465,x0,y143&width=827&height=465&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-30 17:01:32.251737

There are over 100 million people displaced around the world today.
You can act today by looking for organizations in your community already doing the immigrant accompaniment work in your community.
We must never forget that when we say, “never again,” that means today as well.","Protests have broken out across the country against this administration’s immigration enforcement policies. We have seen images of protesters getting arrested, hurt, and pepper sprayed. One image that has struck a chord with Presbyterians was the images of Rev. David Black (First Presbyterian of Chicago, IL) being shot in the head by a pepper ball. The Office of Immigration Issues and Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA) are working together to support Rev. Black and other congregations in the Chicago area. PDA has sent an emergency grant to the Presbytery of Chicago to help them support families who have been impacted by recent immigration enforcement.

The current dismantling of the refugee, asylum, and other immigration status that protect persecuted immigrants contrasts with the lessons we learned from history.

The need for a global refugee framework started at the end of World War II. As Allied troops started entering parts of Europe that were occupied by Nazi Germany, American soldiers ran into the first concentration camps. Soldiers in Asia would run into aftermath of massacres and slavery imposed by the Imperial Japanese. Soldiers would describe the gruesome scenes in their diaries, letters, and over the next decades, speak about it through documentaries. Jewish people and other persecuted people would add to that voice over the years.

One of the most infamous cases of apathy was the case of the MS St. Louis. In 1939, Jewish Europeans went on a cruise ship and tried to obtain protection from persecution in Cuba. The Cuban government turned them away before they could land. They then tried to get protection from the American and Canadian government, but they also denied them. With no choice, the MS St. Louis was forced to turn around back to Europe. Some people were given protection by some European countries not aligned with Nazi Germany, but by the end of the war, 254 of the 937 (27%) passengers were murdered.

For Asian immigrants it was no different. At the time, the Chinese Exclusion Act, alongside the Johnson-Reed Act, banned most Asian people from entering the United States. In one example of the world failing to protect people, millions of Chinese people were massacred, and human rights violation were committed against them at the Battle of Nanjing. Despite this massacre and other atrocities, the United States did not repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act until 1943, and even when it was repealed, only 105 visas were issued to Chinese immigrants every year. It wouldn’t be until the 1965 with the passage of the Immigrant and National Act that Asian migrants were finally allowed to come in without a quota limit.

After the end of WWII, millions of refugees were scattered throughout the world. The world agreed that we would not repeat the mistakes of the war. One of the largest mistakes was the world’s apathy towards refugees trying to escape persecution by the Axis Powers in Europe and Asia. Millions across the world were murdered because of who they were. Yet when they sought protection in other countries, they were turned away.

It was during this time that Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA) began as a response to the refugee crisis as a result of WWII. At that time, PDA was known as Presbyterian World Service. On top of creating PDA, the General Assembly in 1947 passed an overture asking the government to take in 100,000 refugees.

In 1951, the Convention on the Status of Refugees was created. For the first time, the world recognized a global right to petition for protection from persecution in a second country. Since the creation of the U.S. refugee program in 1981, over 3 million people have been successfully resettled. The U.S. now has the largest refugee resettlement program in the world! The U.S. has traditionally resettled the most vulnerable refugee cases including women and children at risk, women heads of households, the elderly, survivors of violence and torture and those with acute medical needs. In 2024, 125,000 refugees were resettled.

There are over 100 million people displaced around the world today. Now more than ever, we should not shrink from our responsibility to protect people who are being persecuted.

The President is expected to announce that the new refugee admissions ceiling will be only 7,500 with most of those slots going to white South Africa Afrikaners. This reduction in refugee numbers will put many in danger who are being persecuted, and it is unjust to the refugees who have been in the years-long refugee background check process. Those refugees on the waitlist now must wait longer to hopefully be resettled with a welcoming administration. This is not to mention that the administration has effectively ended people’s right to petition for asylum at the border a clear violation of the Convention on the Status of Refugees.

Although the refugee and asylum process has been effectively closed, PDA has shifted our work to support congregations and mid-councils protecting people who have sought safety in the U.S. This includes Know Your Rights trainings across many presbyteries, offering technical assistance, offering opportunities to learn more about immigration, supporting advocacy efforts by congregations and individual Presbyterians, and offering grants to programs that are working with migrants.

As Presbyterians, we have been here before. In the 1980 General Assembly, the church voted to approve an overture recommending all congregations to sponsor one or two individuals. In the 1980s, many refugees showed up at the border escaping the civil wars in Central America. When the government refused to give these refugees protections from being deported to their war-torn countries, The Presbyterian Church and other denominations and faiths started the Sanctuary movement. During this time, churches offered protection to migrants at their churches. Although this strategy does not work in today’s world, the spirit of protecting refugees has been a cornerstone of the Presbyterian faith. In 2022, the General Assembly declared that the Presbyterian Church is a Sanctuary and Accompaniment Church.

In the Bible we see many stories of people seeking refuge. Jesus and his family left to seek protection in Egypt from Herod’s tyranny. Ruth left her homeland to go with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Moses guided the former enslaved Hebrews through the desert. The Hebrews forced to leave their homes during the Babylonian Exile. And of course, let’s remember that God directly commands us to protect our foreigner neighbors: “""When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. Treat the foreigner who resides with you as the native-born among you, and love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God"" (Leviticus 19:33-34 NIV)

We must understand as Presbyterians that the time to act is now, not later. Rev. Black and other Presbyterians across the country are acting now through protests in solidarity with migrants and accompanying them to their court appearances. In cooperation with other denominations, the Stated Clerk has released a letter that condemns the administration for having a low refugee admissions ceiling. PDA is acting now. You can act today by looking for organizations in your community already doing the immigrant accompaniment work in your community. If there is not one, it may be God’s call to you to start one.

We must never forget that when we say, “never again,” that means today as well.",https://pcusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/seo/public/2025-10/we%20are%20all%20immigrants%20protest%20photo%20istock.jpg?itok=4UA7KHBw,N,,2025-10-30 16:21:19.997304

The Justice Department asked the court in an emergency filing on October 17 to lift Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry's decision to block the Guard deployment while litigation in the challenge continues.

Perry ruled that Trump likely violated the law establishing preconditions for federalizing Guard troops, as well as the state's rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces answering to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

The case has been characterized by starkly different portrayals of the protests against the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement in and around Chicago.

The administration has said that the words ""regular forces"" mean that the president can call up the National Guard if non-military federal agents who regularly enforce federal laws cannot properly do so.

In an October 10 written ruling, Perry said that historical sources indicate that ""regular forces"" means only members regularly enlisted in the military, including the Army and Navy, as opposed to the National Guard.

Perry wrote that ""in order for the President to call forth the militia to execute the laws, the President must be incapable with the regular forces - that is, lacking the power and force with the military alone - to execute the law.""

Trump's administration ""made no attempt to rely on the regular forces before resorting to federalization of the National Guard,"" Perry said, adding that there are other limits on the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Perry's decision. Noting the debate over the meaning of ""regular forces,"" the three-judge panel said that the administration had not met its burden under either standard.

""Even applying great deference to the administration's view of the facts ... there is insufficient evidence that protest activity in Illinois has significantly impeded the ability of federal officers to execute federal immigration laws,"" the appeals court said.

Sporadic disruptions during protests ""have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities. At the same time, immigration arrests and deportations have proceeded apace,"" the appeals court added. (Reporting by Andrew Chung; editing by Diane Craft)

Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.","CHICAGO -- A Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois has been accused of blocking a federal agent’s vehicle during September protests outside an immigration enforcement building in suburban Chicago, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She's running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

""I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,"" she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

Those arrests and other ICE enforcement activity was top of the agenda during Monday night's special city council meeting.

Paula Schwan, the police chief, explained the city's stance on resident interactions at the meeting.

""When our officers interact with residents or visitors, we do not ask for immigration status,"" Schwan said. ""If someone is arrested, we do not contact ICE to inform them any undocumented person is in custody, and when someone is released, we provide no information beyond what is already publicly available.""

But given the ICE arrest of Diana Romero at The Learning Nest last week, and the arrest of another person at the McDonald's off East Sammamish Parkway Tuesday morning, questions still loom about the city's next moves.

Kelly Jiang is an Issaquah City Council member.

""As a city we are a little bit limited in what we can do, and that's why I've been calling on our state legislators to step up and pass laws that protect our communities,"" Jiang said. ""For example, by requiring all law enforcement to not wear a mask and be able to show you know badge IDs and their names.""

While Issaquah is not specifically identified as a sanctuary city, Washington state is a sanctuary state. Its Keep Washington Working law prevents any local law enforcement from assisting or working for federal immigration agencies.

""I definitely think there's more that can be done, whether it be at the individual level, city level and state level to protect individual community members,"" Jiang added.

Issaquah Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said in a statement she ""recommended that the City Council approve a budget amendment to allocate $50,000 in additional grant funding to support immigration services.""

Jiang supports that amendment and and urged others to do the same.

Besides embargo statutes, the delegations with limited locations fit within two subcategories: trade-reciprocity statutes and treaty-implementation measures.","On Nov. 5, the Supreme Court will hear argument in Trump v. V.O.S. Selections. The Court will address two questions: whether President Trump had authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to issue tariffs against Canada, China, and Mexico on Feb. 1, and “reciprocal tariffs” against nearly all U.S. trading partners on April 2; and, if so, whether IEEPA constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.

The case turns on whether IEEPA, enacted shortly after the National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA), confers tariff authority on the president and, if so, what the president’s scope of action is under the statute and the Constitution. In the absence of any intelligible bounds in the statute itself—and any realistic way to check the president following the Court’s decision to strike down the legislative veto (present in the NEA and applicable to IEEPA emergencies) in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha—IEEPA violates the Constitution’s nondelegation doctrine. As we have suggested in previous articles and one of us has argued in an amicus brief in the V.O.S. Selections case, the Court should address the delegation issues inherent to IEEPA.

Here, we address an important position shared by several noted academic commentators—sometimes called “foreign affairs exceptionalism”—that nondelegation strictures have little to say about congressional grants of authority in the foreign affairs context. This view is based in part on functional considerations that presidents have access to superior intelligence on the underlying issues, need flexibility to deal with unforeseeable events, and must act under the shield of confidentiality. It also, however, draws essential and continuing sustenance from Justice George Sutherland’s opinion for the Court (Justice James McReynolds dissented without opinion and Justice Harlan Stone did not participate) in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.

In that opinion, the Court declared that when the president acts in matters of “external affairs,” especially with congressional authorization, the history of congressional delegations in this arena would have to be wholly disregarded to find a constitutional defect in the delegation involved in the statute before it. The Court’s language may, technically, have been dicta as the statute in Curtiss-Wright easily satisfied the conditional-legislation test upheld in Field v. Clark. It nevertheless has been, and remains, highly influential.

We write here to unpack this “historical gloss” argument in Curtiss-Wright. Justice Sutherland’s opinion catalogued a number of statutes that “either leave the exercise of the power to his unrestricted judgment or provide a standard far more general than that which has always been considered requisite with regard to domestic affairs.” Despite this assertion, these laws involved fairly narrow delegations, particularly when compared to IEEPA. The laws identified by Sutherland indeed exemplify defined limits on foreign affairs delegation—namely, limits on the duration of the delegations or the goods or locations that could be targeted. Consequently, the Supreme Court should not take the Curtiss-Wright case as upholding the kind of unbounded delegation authority claimed by Trump’s invocation of IEEPA.

Sutherland discussed nine statutes in the text of the Curtiss-Wright opinion, and another 24 statutes in a footnote, all of which we have separated into categories based on the kinds of limits they impose; Sutherland did not address the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA; IEEPA’s predecessor statute) even though a version of the TWEA was in operation at the time of the case. Consequently, we do not address the TWEA here. Instead, we note that the original version of the TWEA was limited to use during wars and consequently may not raise the same concerns as later amendments to the TWEA or those present in IEEPA.

Time-Limited Delegations

The early foreign affairs delegations concerned embargoes enacted by Congress. All of these delegations involved a durational limitation; Congress used a mixture of explicit and implicit time limitations when enacting these statutes. Congress enacted explicit limitations by adding a sunset clause requiring new legislation and enacted implicit limitations by linking the law to an underlying embargo statute that included a sunset clause. Additionally, many of the delegations in these time-limited laws permitted the president to suspend portions of the statutes under specified conditions.

Explicit Time Limitations

The Act of June 4, 1794 is the earliest example of an express time-limited delegation. Although the statute itself is short and sometimes characterized as a “delegation of remarkable power” because the statute authorized the president to “lay an embargo on all ships and vessels … under such regulations as the circumstances of the case may require, and to continue or revoke the same, whenever he shall think proper,” the powers delegated by the statute could “not be exercised, while the Congress of the United States [was] in session” and any embargo laid would “cease and determine in fifteen days from the actual meeting of Congress.” In practice, this meant the delegation operated for only a little over 5 months, since Congress started its second session on Nov. 3, 1794.

Similar time limitations were present in the Act of June 13, 1798, which created a “partial restriction” on trade with France rather than a “general embargo” in the lead-up to the Quasi-War (1798-1800) and authorized the president “to remit and discontinue the prohibitions and restraints” on commerce with France under certain conditions. This statute was scheduled to terminate at “the end of the next session of Congress,” which resulted in an approximately 10-month-long delegation. Likewise, the Act of Feb. 9, 1799—another partial embargo of France that granted the president authority to “remit and discontinue” the embargo provisions under certain conditions—was scheduled to expire on “the third day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred” resulting in a delegation of approximately 13 months in duration. The Act of Feb. 27, 1800 enacted further restrictions on commerce with France with similar authority for the president to “remit and discontinue” the provisions. This statute was scheduled to expire on “the third day of March, one thousand eight hundred and one,” resulting in a delegation operative for approximately one year. The Act of Feb. 28, 1806 placed a partial embargo on “the island of St. Domingo,” with similar “remit and discontinue” provisions for the president, and was scheduled to last for only “one year, and no longer.” Of similar import, see the Act of Dec. 19, 1806 (a bit more than 5 months); the Act of April 22, 1808, which authorized the president to suspend the Embargo Act of 1807 “during the recess of Congress”; and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809, which embargoed both Great Britain and France and authorized the president to suspend the embargo as to whichever country “shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States” (a little over a year).

Even though the Act of March 3, 1805 involved a narrower subject matter than countrywide embargoes, the statute still had a durational limit and was scheduled to last “for the term of two years, and from thence to the end of the next session of Congress, and no longer.” Another similarly narrow statute was the Act of March 3, 1817, which prohibited the importation, using “any foreign vessel” of “plaster of Paris … [from] any country, or its dependencies, from which the vessels of the United States are not permitted to bring the same article.” This measure authorized the president to suspend this prohibition as to any country that “shall discontinue such regulations” of its own. This statute was scheduled to “continue and be in force [for] five years.”

Implicit Time Limitations

Several statutes included implicit time limitations, though this was less common. These limits were implicit because the delegation was based on a separate statute that included a time limit. The Resolution of May 7, 1794 is one such statute. This resolution authorized the president to grant clearances “to any ship or vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, which are now loaded, bound from any port in the United States, for any port beyond the Cape of Good Hope.” Although the resolution itself did not have any time limitation, it provided an exception to the embargo imposed by the Resolution of March 26, 1794, thus containing an implicit time limit. That embargo was scheduled to expire on May 25, 1794. Consequently, the delegation afforded by the Resolution of May 7, 1794 was operative for only 18 days. Likewise, the Act of March 3, 1795, which authorized the president “to permit the exportation of arms, cannon and military stores, the law prohibiting the exportation of the same to the contrary notwithstanding,” lacked an explicit time limitation. The “law … to the contrary” mentioned by this statute, however, did contain an explicit time limitation and was scheduled to expire after “the term of one year.” That term ended on May 22, 1795, and consequently, the delegation afforded the president by the Act of March 3, 1795 was operative for a little less than 3 months.

Suspensions

Finally, the Act of May 1, 1810 authorized the president to suspend certain portions of the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 with either France or Great Britain should either of them “cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States.” This statute lacked an expiration clause; however, the president’s power to suspend portions of the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 required France or Great Britain to cease violating the United States’s neutral commerce prior to “the third day of March next,” creating an implicit time limitation of approximately 10 months for this delegation.

Location-Limited Delegations

The second limitation category is limited or targeted locations. Several of the statutes discussed in the previous section had location limitations by virtue of being embargoes against specified locations. Besides embargo statutes, the delegations with limited locations fit within two subcategories: trade-reciprocity statutes and treaty-implementation measures.

The trade-reciprocity statutes follow one of two formats. The first format repealed specified tariff statutes with the caveat that the repeal becomes effective on a country-by-country basis only when foreign countries repeal similar tariffs on the United States. The second format authorized the president to exempt countries from certain tariffs (without repealing the tariff itself) should other countries repeal equivalent tariffs they have on the United States, or in some cases to raise tariffs to meet foreign tariff rates. The statutes that fit the first format are the Act of March 3, 1815, the Act of Jan. 27, 1824, the Act of May 24, 1828, and the Act of May 31, 1830. The statutes that fit the second format are the Act of July 13, 1832, the Act of June 26, 1884, the Act of June 19, 1886, the Act of July 24, 1897, and the Act of June 17, 1930. One minor exception to these formats is the Act of March 3, 1851. which followed the second format but dealt with international postage rates rather than tariffs.

The treaty-implementing statutes all follow the same general pattern. The statute authorized the president to determine when the partner(s) to the underlying treaty had enacted laws to implement the treaty on their end. After such a determination, the president was to issue a proclamation stating such a determination was made, at which point the treaty-implementing statute would automatically come into force.

The one variation on this pattern are treaty-framework statutes. These statutes lack an underlying treaty and instead contemplate a future treaty or treaties that will cover a certain issue or meet certain criteria. The statutes following the standard pattern are the Act of Aug. 5, 1854 (implementing the Elgin-Marcy Treaty), the Act of March 1, 1873 (implementing the Treaty of Washington), the Act of Aug. 15, 1876 (implementing the U.S.-Hawaii Reciprocity Treaty of 1875), the Act of Dec. 17, 1903 (implementing the Commercial Convention of 1902 [between the United States and Cuba]). The statutes following the treaty-framework pattern are the Act of June 11, 1864 (framework for treaties governing jurisdiction of maritime controversies) and the Act of Feb. 21, 1893 (framework for treaties protecting fur seals in the Pacific Ocean).

Toward the end of the 19th century, Congress returned to embargo-style delegations, but without the durational limits of the earlier period. Instead of time limitations, these statutes included more detailed conditions and restraints on the circumstances under which the delegated authority could be exercised. The Act of March 3, 1887 effectively granted a limited embargo power to the president to use against “the British dominions of North America,” providing three specific situations in which the president could exercise this power. Similarly, the Act of July 26, 1892 granted a limited embargo power to the president “to suspend … for such time and to such extent (including absolute prohibition) as he shall deem just, the right of free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal” whenever “the passage through any canal or lock connected with the navigation of the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or the water ways connecting the same … is prohibited or is made difficult or burdensome by the imposition of tolls or otherwise.” The embargo would apply only to the Dominion of Canada, the country burdening the navigation of these bodies of water. The Act of Sept. 8, 1916 (besides implementing an income tax) provided several circumstances under which the president can effectively issue an embargo. The statute described the conditions in detail, including reciprocal trade prohibitions and whenever during a foreign war one of the belligerent countries subjected U.S. trade to “unreasonable prejudice, disadvantage, injury, or discrimination.”

One statute substantively does not fit well into any of the above subcategories but shares similarities with several of them. The Act of March 23, 1874 authorized the president “to suspend the operations” of the Act of June 22, 1860 (providing for judicial functions in certain countries where U.S. citizens resided or conducted business), whenever he “shall receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman government, or that of Egypt, has organized other tribunals on a basis likely to secure to citizens of the United States, in their dominions, the same impartial justice which they now enjoy there under the judicial functions exercised by the minister, consuls, and other functionaries of the United States.” Like other measures previously discussed, this law permitted the president to suspend the operation of an underlying statute if specific countries took specific actions. Although there is no underlying treaty, this statute was limited to specific countries and involved a narrow issue (judicial functions or tribunals).

Limited or Targeted Goods Delegations

The third and final limitations category is limited or targeted goods. Although some delegations in the previous categories included limitations as the goods impacted, this category did not come to the fore until the end of the 19th century. These statutes dealt exclusively with the exportation of war materials to countries actively or soon to be engaged in war. These statutes were the Resolution of April 22, 1898, the Resolution of March 14, 1912, and the Resolution of Jan. 31, 1922.

The earliest foreign affairs delegations uniformly contained a durational limit, either explicitly or implicitly, and dealt almost exclusively with embargoes. The mid and late 1800s saw a pattern of enacting delegations without a time limitation for the purposes of decreasing tariff and trade barriers on a bilateral basis with other countries. The president’s role in such schemes was to determine when foreign nations eliminated their barriers to U.S. commerce, at which point the U.S. barriers toward that country would also be eliminated by operation of statute. Congress gave further factfinding roles to the president regarding treaty implementation, with several statutes in the mid to late 1800s authorizing the president to determine when various treaty partners had put treaties into effect, at which point the treaty would automatically go into effect and be implemented in the U.S. by operation of statute. Toward the end of the 1800s, there was a return to more embargo-oriented statutes, but without explicit time limitations. The most broadly worded of these statutes was the Resolution of April 22, 1898, yet even this statute was limited to “coal or other material used in war.” Consequently, it is clear that even though the strictness of regulations on foreign affairs delegations may have waxed and waned between the early 1800s and the early 1900s, a limitation as to goods, location, or duration was always present in these foreign affairs delegations.

***

If the statutes discussed or cited in Curtiss-Wright are any guide, the view—embraced by many academics—that congressional delegations in the foreign affairs arena are essentially free of constitutional nondelegation strictures should be reexamined; the history of congressional delegations does not support this view. Moreover, with respect to the Trump tariff litigation now facing the Supreme Court, IEEPA emerges as far and away the outlier among such delegations and should be recognized as a violation of the Constitution’s nondelegation principles.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-30 14:05:07.337494

In their letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, the Senators raised concerns with the “near-total secrecy” under which IAO operates in light of a series of troubling immigration enforcement actions that this Administration has taken – pointing to examples and credible reports of violations of detainees’ rights and inhumane treatment while in ICE custody. They pressed Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons for responses to a series of questions in the interest of providing much-needed transparency for Congress and the American public on these issues, including around the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

“We write to express our concerns regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) severe lack of transparency. IAO has been at the center of troubling actions ICE has taken under this administration but provides no public data on its operations,” the Senators began.

“IAO has been centrally involved in facilitating several concerning immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump Administration,” they wrote, pointing to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the relocation of university student Rumeysa Ozturk before a judge could rule on her case, and the attempted deportation of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala without due process. “These cases paint a troubling picture of IAO attempting to shortcut due process rights and avoid or defy judicial authority.

“IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers,” they continued. “The ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 report finds that flight volume is also trending upward, as the number of IAO flights has steadily increased throughout the year, with the months of May through August reaching higher figures than ever previously recorded.”

“Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as ‘dehumanizing’ and even ‘dangerous,’” they added. “A recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several detainees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them where they were going. […] Detainees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. In addition, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.”

“Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency,” they concluded, going on to list a series of questions for response by Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons regarding the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

Text of the letter, including the questions that the Senators pose to the Administration officials, can be viewed here and below.

Dear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons,

We write to express our concerns regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) severe lack of transparency. IAO has been at the center of troubling actions ICE has taken under this administration but provides no public data on its operations. The only public data shared on its website is that “IAO stages a total of 12 aircraft at its operational locations in Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida” which has not been updated since August 8, 2023.

According to ICE’s website, IAO is the agency’s primary air transportation division, responsible for conducting the removal of noncitizens with final orders of removal to their countries of origin, as well as the transfer of detained noncitizens domestically to ICE-managed detention facilities. IAO also conducts “Special High Risk Charter flights” to deport noncitizens subject to final orders of removal to third countries. Notably, ICE does not own any planes—it uses contracted or chartered planes or purchases seats on commercial flights.

IAO has been centrally involved in facilitating several concerning immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump Administration. It transported Kilmar Abrego Garcia from Maryland to Louisiana to Texas, before illegally deporting him to El Salvador’s infamous CECOT prison over a period of just three days. The same day Kilmar was unlawfully deported, IAO took hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador without due process despite a judge’s order that the planes not take off, or if they had taken off, to return to the United States. IAO also swiftly flew students being targeted by ICE for exercising their free speech rights, such as Rumeysa Ozturk, out of their local court’s jurisdiction in what has appeared to be an attempt to remove them before their local judge can issue an order in their case. Additionally, ICE attempted to deport at least 76 unaccompanied minors to Guatemala in the middle of the night, requiring a judge to issue a temporary restraining order at approximately four a.m. preventing their deportation without due process. By the time the temporary restraining order was put in place, several of the children had already boarded planes. These cases paint a troubling picture of IAO attempting to shortcut due process rights and avoid or defy judicial authority.

IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers. Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor project, which uses publicly available aviation data to monitor IAO’s flights, estimates that between January 20, 2025, and the end of August 2025, IAO has flown at least 7,454 total immigration enforcement flights to at least 66 different countries—a 34 percent increase over the same time period last year and the highest since tracking began in 2020. Public reporting notes that at least 180,000 people have been deported since January 20, 2025. The ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 report finds that flight volume is also trending upward, as the number of IAO flights has steadily increased throughout the year, with the months of May through August reaching higher figures than ever previously recorded.

In August 2025 alone, the ICE Flight Monitor tracked the highest monthly total of at least 1,393 U.S. immigration enforcement flights—averaging 45 flights a day. This tracks with reporting that earlier this year ICE modified its contract with CSI Aviation, its primary air charter company, to increase the number of flights and has been expanding its network of airline partners—including budget retail airline, Avelo, which appears to be the first retail airline to sign a long-term contract flying for ICE.

The Trump Administration has also been using U.S. military planes to carry out deportation flights, for which there is even less transparency, including logistical and financial coordination between ICE and the Department of Defense (DOD). Military flights can fly where no other planes can and provide less public information to protect operational security. The ICE Flight Monitor reports that the Trump Administration has used military planes to carry out at least 85 deportation flights since January 2025. They have primarily used C-17 and C-130 Air Force cargo planes, which are significantly more expensive than standard IAO charter flights, with the C-17 flights reportedly costing $28,500 an hour.

Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as “dehumanizing” and even “dangerous.” According to the “ICE Air Operations Handbook,” dated February 2024, which was released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, IAO requires that every detainee “be fully restrained by the use of… handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons” during their flight. Under “special circumstances,” IAO may restrain detainees with “spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, the WRAP,” or other such restraint. The “WRAP” is a full-body restraint device used to completely immobilize a person, and its use by local law enforcement has reportedly contributed to at least a dozen deaths in the last decade. Multi-country flights have reportedly left some individuals shackled for as long as 50 hours.

A recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several detainees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them where they were going. Once the detainees landed outside of the U.S. they reported that U.S. officials told local officials of the third-party country to send the detainees to their countries of origin, circumventing court orders against deportation to those countries. Additionally, recent filings in another lawsuit allege that ICE officials beat detainees in an effort to forcibly remove them from one of the planes that landed in El Salvador back in March. Detainees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. In addition, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.

The Trump Administration reportedly intends to significantly increase the volume of deportations with the $75 billion provided for ICE in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act over the next four years. DHS has also requested nearly $11 billion for ICE in discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2026.

Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency. We request the following documents and information by November 12, 2025:

Costs of Operations

When there are violations of the guidelines in the IAO Handbook, how are they reported and adjudicated?

The ICE Air Operations Handbook does not include any guidelines on procedures to prevent, detect, and respond to incidents of sexual harassment and sexual assault during air transport. What written policies or procedures govern the prevention, monitoring, and response to allegations of sexual harassment and assault during IAO operations?

What reporting mechanisms exist for noncitizens to report allegations of sexual harassment and assault?

What measures are taken to ensure that detainees are screened prior to flight to identify those at risk of being victims or perpetrators of sexual abuse?

Based on flight tracking done by Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor and Tom Cartwright, it appears that there are more multi-stop routes now than in years prior. Is that a strategy change?

If so, what is the rationale for this change?

Are any extra accommodations made with respect to meals and restraints on the longer flights, which have been as long as 50-hour journeys? For example, is there a meal at least every 8 hours and are restraints removed at some times?

DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties stated in its FY2023 annual report that “ICE does not have sufficient policies or operational guidance governing its use of the WRAP, contributing to concerns in the way it was used” and issued a recommendation that ICE develop “a policy governing use of the WRAP, documentation, and new expanded and specific training.”

Has ICE fulfilled this recommendation?

Please provide the policy governing the use of the WRAP, the training requirements, and the training documents for DHS employees and contractors who may use it.

Which ICE employees and contractors are trained to use the WRAP? Are all ICE employees and contractors who have used or can use the WRAP trained to do so?

Is ICE tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force?

Please provide records documenting ICE’s use of the WRAP.

Fleet and Operations

How many planes does IAO currently have in its chartered fleet, and how many more are available to IAO in its reserve fleet?

Do you plan to increase the size of the IAO charter and reserve fleets, and if so, by how much?

Which domestic airports are being used by ICE for these flights? Please provide a list of the airports and the number of domestic and removal flights, respectively, to and from each.

How is it determined if a deportation mission will use traditional IAO planes or military planes?

Which agency makes that decision?

Are Military Police, or any other DoD service members, providing security or other services on ICE Air commercial charter flights?

Do you anticipate a higher or lower percentage of future deportations will be carried out on military planes with anticipated volume changes and funding availability?

How do you make the determination to use commercial flights?

What percentage of people deported by air are via commercial flights?

What percent of these returns include escorts and what percent are not escorted returns?

Are people in restraints on escorted flights?

Carriers and Contracting

Please provide any requests for proposal and resulting executed contracts with any brokers or carriers, including CSI Aviation.

Are you actively in contract discussions with CSI or other carriers, even if exploratory, about augmenting contract carriers and planes for daily and high-risk flights?

Flight Data and Destinations

Please provide a list of destination countries, number of deportees, nationalities of deportees, and whether the flight was on a military plane or other IAO-chartered plane by domestic or removal flight since January 20, 2025.

For removal flights, please also list whether the flight was removing the deportees to their countries of origin or to a third country.

If the flight was to a third country, please list the percentage of the deportees who were considered security risks or other rationale for their being removed to a third country.

If the flight was to a third country, please clarify if that country was directed or authorized to deport the individuals to their countries of origin.

Voluntary Returns

If an individual in ICE custody agrees to voluntary removal, must the individual then await scheduling for a return flight arranged by ICE?

Are individuals in ICE custody, who have previously agreed to voluntary departure, permitted to arrange and pay for their own travel out of the U.S.?

ICE reportedly has a $950 million contract with Salus Worldwide to effectuate voluntary returns.

What services will they provide?

Please detail the bidding process for this contract, including any deviations from prior bidding processes for flight contracts.

TOP TALKER

ILLINOIS WAS SWEPT UP Wednesday by a wave of dramatic legal and political developments over immigration enforcement: Political figures were indicted for protests, “Midway Blitz” leader Gregory Bovino won a reprieve from daily court check-ins, and Springfield lawmakers may expand constitutional protections for residents.

About the indictment: Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive Democrat running for Congress, was among six demonstrators who were charged with surrounding a government vehicle, banging on its hood and windows and scratching the surface — including etching the word “PIG.” More here on POLITICO’s homepage

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent,” Abughazaleh said in a statement, adding, “I’m going to fight these unjust charges.”

Others indicted include Catherine Sharp, chief of staff to Chicago Ald. Andre Vasquez and a candidate for the Cook County Board; Chicago Democratic Ward Committeeman Michael Rabbitt; and Oak Park Village Board Trustee Brian Straw.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some background: Abughazaleh is a regular protester at the Broadview site and has used videos of the encounters to promote her campaign for Congress in the 9th Congressional District.

Other candidates in the IL-09 race condemned the Justice Department’s action. “The Trump administration is targeting protestors, including political candidates, in an effort to silence dissent and scare residents into submission. It won’t work,” said Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss. State Sen. Laura Fine said “Today, it’s Kat. Tomorrow, it could be any one of us.” Democratic Committeeman Bruce Leon called it a “blatant abuse of power.” State Sen. Mike Simmons called it “a blatant attempt to suppress free speech.” And former prosecutor and candidate Nick Pyati called the charges “weaponized and manufactured.”

And Congresswoman Delia Ramirez issued a statement, saying: “If it sounds like authoritarianism, moves like authoritarianism and looks like authoritarianism, IT IS AUTHORITARIANISM.”

In a separate legal development, a federal appeals court ruled that Bovino — who is leading the immigration-enforcement effort in Illinois — does not have to report daily to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis. Earlier this week, the judge had ordered the 6 p.m. briefings amid concerns that Bovino’s team had used tear gas and pepper balls inappropriately.

The Justice Department asked the appellate court for a “writ of mandamus,” which tells a lower court judge to stop doing something that’s seen as out of bounds. In this case, the government says Bovino showing up at the same place every day puts him in danger.

Though daily meetings were blocked, Bovino still must sit for a private deposition today, according to The Associated Press.

And amid mounting concern over federal enforcement tactics, the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus led by Senate President Don Harmon introduced legislation that would allow Illinois residents to bring civil actions against any person who deprives them of their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution under the Illinois Constitution. The measure calls for allowing courts to award punitive damages based on the severity of the defendant’s conduct, according to a statement.

THE BUZZ

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Technology entrepreneur Junaid Ahmed has been endorsed by businessman Christ Kallas, who was also running for the seat but has since suspended his campaign.

The move narrows the Democratic primary candidates in the competitive race for the seat now held by Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, who’s running for Senate.

“I’m proud to endorse Junaid Ahmed for Congress and know he will be the progressive leader working families deserve in Washington,” Kallas said in a statement.

How they line up: Ahmed, who ran against Krishnamoorthi in 2024 and is positioning himself as the progressive alternative to other candidates — mainly former Congresswoman Melissa Bean, who served from 2005 to 2011 as a “Blue Dog” Democrat.

Meanwhile, Yasmeen Bankole, a Hanover Park trustee, is also securing progressive credentials. She’s been endorsed by former Congressman Bobby Rush.

And Cook County Commissioner Kevin Morrison, has the support of the National Restaurant Association. “As the son of a local restaurant owner, Kevin Morrison knows firsthand the struggles mom-and-pop operators in Illinois face, and he is committed to fighting for them every day,” Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia said in a statement and referring to the Morrison family’s Dino’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant in Chicago.

The other Democratic players in the race include Army veteran and attorney Dan Tully, entrepreneur and CEO Neil Khot, Hanover Park community leader Joseph Wentzel and entrepreneur Sanjyot Dunung, who served on the National Small Business Association.

TAKING NAMES

— OH, CANADA: Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau headlined the Chicago Council on Global Affairs leadership awards program Wednesday night and brought the house down as soon as he took the stage.

“I’m really touched that you would honor a Canadian,” he said, noting, with his tongue in cheek, the “terrible conflict” between Canada and the United States. The line drew a burst of laughter from the friendly crowd that included former U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman and his wife, Vicki Heyman.

Then Trudeau got serious, talking about the “moment of challenge” between the two countries.

About the tariffs: Trudeau, who was honored at the event, said the tariff dispute between the U.S. and Canada “feels personal because it makes absolutely no economic sense at a time of tremendous pressures — geopolitically — that the American administration would choose to turn its back on the ally and friend that’s been there for you for decades, generations and centuries, fighting side by side with you … because we believe in the same values.”

Reflecting on past cooperation, Trudeau reminded the audience that “it’s not irretrievable, but it is real. And I would ask you to be patient and understanding towards Canadians and to remember what we were able to do in my first term and President Trump’s first term, when there was a very, very real threat of ripping up the North American Free Trade Agreement, the most successful free trade agreement ever signed anywhere in the world.”

Also honored at the Four Seasons Hotel event were Invenergy CEO Michael Polsky and his wife, Polsky Foundation President Tanya Polsky, and businesswoman Regina Cross.

In the room: Former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer, Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, World Business Chicago CEO Philip Clement, former Ambassador Fay Hartog-Levin, United Airlines President Brett Hart, business leader Raj Fernando, Goldman Sachs’ Ron Levin, University of Chicago Business School’s Mark Tebbe, The Chicago Community Trust CEO Andrea Sáenz, Big Shoulders Fund CEO Josh Hale, Openlands CEO Michael Davidson and St. James Church Pastor Chris Harris.

— SNAP ORDER: With the federal government halting SNAP benefits for more than 1.9 million Illinoisans starting Saturday, Gov. JB Pritzker plans to sign an executive order launching a statewide response to protect food access and invest $20 million in food banks across Illinois — with $10 million coming from the Budget Reserve for Immediate Disbursements and Governmental Emergencies Fund and $10 million from the Illinois Department of Human Services.

The funding will help stock shelves at more than 2,600 pantries while state agencies, grocers, and community groups coordinate efforts to keep families fed. “No one should go hungry because of politics,” Pritzker said in a statement. Residents who want to help can support local food banks by donating at Feeding Illinois.

Reader Digest

We asked whether the shape of a congressional district matters.

Denise Barreto: “Absolutely yes, shape matters. It’s all imaginary lines and when we overstretch or shorten to meet an agenda, no one wins.”

Mimi Cowan: “If the shape is a result of gerrymandering and people can tell, that undermines the public’s belief in fair elections.”

Peter Creticos: “Having drawn many fluky districts, including congressional ones, in my early days: Good is achieved when the shape enables communities of people to exercise their voting franchise effectively.”

Brent Pruim: “District shape can matter when it distorts overall representation, but not every oddly shaped district is unfair. Impact depends on context, not just appearance.”

Alex Sutton: “If it looks like earmuffs, a rabbit on a skateboard or Goofy kicking Donald Duck, then I don’t want it.”

Van Hollen was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and six others.
The Wrap is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture.
“When an organization like DHS doesn’t want transparency, it’s because they don’t want people to know what they’re doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency.
“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.","A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

“I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told the Associated Press. “They want to keep the public in the dark.”

The senators’ letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people – sometimes for hours – on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and six others.

The Wrap is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the Wrap’s use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

“When an organization like DHS doesn’t want transparency, it’s because they don’t want people to know what they’re doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency.

In addition to the letter, Representative Delia Ramirez told AP in a statement that she was working on a bill to rein in the agency’s use of the Wrap.

“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.

The DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the Wrap. The DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, previously said that ICE’s practices “align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards”.

The AP found that the DHS has paid the manufacturer of the Wrap, Safe Restraints Inc, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the Wrap despite multiple requests, and it is not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE’s use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the US used the Wrap and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

“The brutal, inhumane tactics of ICE continue to jeopardize people’s lives across the country,” Ramirez said. “ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability. That can’t go on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6632283b0e3a64c22813f18a9f3035399d084e80/234_0_2338_1870/master/2338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f1f92d5ec199c8f713f908af54d6839",N,,2025-10-30 10:17:07.778172

Oct. 30, 2025, WASHINGTON, D.C. —Today, the American Immigration Council launched a platform analyzing new records about the U.S. government’s chaotic implementation of family separations during the zero-tolerance period and its aftermath.

The transparency project details how the first Trump administration carried out one of the most shameful immigration policies in modern history. The project also sheds light on how certain stakeholders responded to the crisis, providing important lessons on how the public resisted one of the most egregious and harmful policies of the first Trump administration.

Explore the data here.

Drawing on thousands of internal government emails, memos, and never-before-seen datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and litigation, the project shows how the first Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy was a calculated system designed to deter migrants from coming to the United States by punishing families and obscuring accountability.

“Thanks to these records, we can more clearly see the inner workings of how this atrocity was carried out and the public’s struggle to obtain transparency and accountability,” said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council. “The same disregard for oversight and human consequences that made family separation possible is now re-emerging in the ongoing mass detention and deportation efforts.”

The family separation project features interactive visualizations and declassified documents that reveal how families were literally erased from government databases, how officials misled the public, and how congressional oversight and media exposure helped end the policy. The project includes audio recordings of actor Corey Stoll reading key internal government emails that reveal the confusion and callousness behind the policy’s implementation. (Listen here).

Key findings from the archive include:

Officials knew their data on separated families was “corrupt.” Internal emails show ICE leaders admitting they had “not very much” confidence in their own data on children taken from their parents, even as they publicly denied wrongdoing.

Oversight from Congress, the press, and regulatory agencies played a key role in ending family separation. However, since then, as of 2025 key oversight bodies like the DHS Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties have been sidelined or defunded.

Family separation was built around intentional chaos. The records show how confusion was weaponized: ensuring significant delays in reunifying children with their parents.

“The records don’t just show government officials’ egregiousness and cruelty. They serve as a warning for our current moment of mass detention and deportation that is still seeing families separated,” said Pinto. “These records show how data manipulation and secrecy enabled systemic human rights violations during the first Trump administration. Without transparency and oversight, history will repeat itself.”

Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.
“Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good,” the Education Department wrote in a fact sheet.
In completing the rule, the department dismissed concerns from many who said the standard of evidence is too low.
The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law.","WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness program if their work is deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” — a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.

New rules finalized Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration calls it necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution.

Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.

It grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or “chemical castration” of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organizations. “Chemical castration” is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty — gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.

It amounts to a major reworking of a program that has canceled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs. The Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.

“Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good,” the Education Department wrote in a fact sheet. “Congress focuses on public service, and the Trump Administration will not direct taxpayer dollars from hardworking Americans to organizations that are breaking the law.”

The program promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments. It has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits’ tax status and their field of work.

The benefit has gone to workers at organizations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has “misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”

A central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organization's work should be considered to have a “substantial illegal purpose.”

Employers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the program if a state or federal court rules against them or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. It appears that performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, could be grounds for expulsion.

Even without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organization should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the “preponderance of the evidence” leans against the employer.

In completing the rule, the department dismissed concerns from many who said the standard of evidence is too low.

“It ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers,” federal officials wrote.

Among those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.

The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, “simply because those attorneys’ jobs were deemed politically unfavorable by the Secretary.”

The National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology.”

Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at “radical organizations that violate state and federal laws.” “Aiding illegal immigration, supporting terrorism, or promoting child abuse through gender transitions is not ‘public service,'” Walberg said in a statement.

According to the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. They would be notified and given a chance to review the evidence and respond to the department's findings. Those barred from the program can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a “corrective action plan” approved by the secretary.

Documents from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances. Not all organizations that break the law have a “substantial illegal purpose,” the agency said, and it ultimately comes down to the secretary's analysis of the evidence.

National Guard in Chicago The Trump administration seems to have somewhat pulled back on deploying additional National Guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, at least for now.","A group of U.S. Senate Democrats have sent a letter to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) seeking a cost analysis of the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to multiple cities nationwide.

President Donald Trump’s orders to send federal personnel into Democrat-run cities and districts including Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, Memphis and Washington D.C. have drawn pushback from critics who have referred to it as fear mongering and politically motivated. Trump suggested Tuesday while in Japan that he may go a step further to ensure “safe cities” remain, according to reports.

The back-and-forth has resulted in legal battles still playing out in courts, with a three-judge appellate panel ruling last week in a 2-1 decision to stay a temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut to bar ""the federalization and deployment of Oregon National Guard service members.""

On Monday, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, led colleagues in their CBO request to analyze the costs of activating, deploying and compensating National Guard personnel, as well as the cost to sustain and maintain these deployments.

The letter, addressed to CBO Director Phillip Swagel, cites “serious fiscal, legal and constitutional concerns"" that warrant ""close congressional scrutiny.”

“Deploying federalized National Guard units for domestic security operations marks a significant departure from long-standing practice,” the letter reads. “It also carries substantial cost implications that have not been publicly disclosed or formally justified to Congress.

“The American people deserve full transparency regarding how their tax dollars are being used, especially as it pertains to the deployment of military personnel for missions on U.S. soil without a declared emergency or state request.”

The letter was signed by Merkley and Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (MD), Richard Blumenthal (CT), Cory Booker (NJ), Tammy Duckworth (IL), Dick Durbin (IL), Andy Kim (NJ), Alex Padilla (CA), Chris Van Hollen (MD), Elizabeth Warren (MA) and Ron Wyden (OR).

A CBO spokesperson said in an automated message that due to the ongoing government shutdown, CBO has been instructed by House and Senate Budget Committees to provide support to address the immediate needs of Congress.

""The agency will continue to publish cost estimates and other publications the Congress requires on its public website,"" they added.

“President Trump wants every city across the country to be safe, which is why he has generously offered additional resources—the National Guard—to state and local officials,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Military.com. ""Americans are thankful for the National Guard’s dedication and service to protecting our cities and the federal officers who are located there, as they are doing in our nation’s capital.”

'Cities Are Troubled'

On Tuesday in Japan, as part of his trip to Asia to meet with world leaders, Trump maintained a strong affinity towards deploying additional National Guard troops to other U.S. cities should his administration find it necessary.

“We have cities that are troubled, we can’t have cities that are troubled,” Trump said aboard an aircraft carrier, speaking to troops on the USS George Washington at the Yokosuka Naval Base. “And we’re sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard, because we’re going to have safe cities.”

Trump has exerted his assumed authority to deploy said troops in response to what he and administration officials have claimed are a response for protection for federal agents working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The president, in an Aug. 11 memorandum explaining the motives for mobilizing the Washington D.C. National Guard, called the area “under siege from violent crime,” adding that “[i]t is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world.”

Although District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the administration for its deployment, a Joint Task Force (JTF) D.C. spokesperson told Military.com earlier this month that National Guard troops will stay in the district and remain “resolute” in its mission.

National Guard in Chicago

The Trump administration seems to have somewhat pulled back on deploying additional National Guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, at least for now.

That’s according to Alderman Andre Vasquez, who represents Chicago’s 40th ward, who told Military.com that he’s more so seen federal agents (ICE) “masked up” in residential communities.

“I think it’s still a bunch of guys with masks kidnapping people off the street,” Vasquez said. “What’s concerning is, you got tear gas being thrown on residential streets. So, at what point does the escalation lead to them justifying larger military action? That’s something we’re all concerned about.

“We’re all doing our best to make sure we’re training people to do things constitutionally, safely, to record information and work through the court systems to make sure we’re holding this government accountable.”

Democrats' portrayal of ICE has been disputed by Republicans and the Trump administration.

“Our officers are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, abusers and gang members. [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin previously told Military.com about troops and civilians at odds in Chicago this past weekend.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military said yesterday that it conducted a “targeted strike” in the area of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, adding that it was targeting a site where weapons were stored. The strikes killed at least two people, according to al-Shifa Hospital. Ahmed Elimam reports for Reuters; Stephen Quillen reports for Al Jazeera.

Israel released a 15-minute drone video on Tuesday, allegedly showing Hamas members staging the discovery of a deceased Israeli hostage on Monday. The New York Times confirmed that the video was filmed in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, and satellite imagery confirmed that dirt was moved from that area between Monday and Tuesday. It is unclear why the bag with the body inside was reburied and unearthed as shown in the video, or how that was explained to Red Cross representatives. Aric Toler, Arijeta Lajka, Monika Cvorak, and Liam Stack report for the New York Times.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Israel has erected nearly 1,000 barriers in cities and towns across the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the war in Gaza, according to an official Palestinian governmental body. The barriers include metal gates stationed at village and town entrances, which block access in and out, with the Israeli military sometimes stationed at them. The U.N. documented the installation of 18 gates in the West Bank at the beginning of September. Israel says the gates are to “manage and monitor.” Sam Mednick and Jalal Bwaitel report for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed yesterday that Russian troops have surrounded Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk and Kupiansk. Putin offered to negotiate a deal for their surrender, adding that Russia was ready to open safe corridors for Western journalists to “let them see with their own eyes what’s going on.” Ukrainian armed forces said that Moscow’s claims about Kupiansk are “fabrications and fantasies, while the situation in Pokrovsk is “hard but under control,” a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces told AP News. Independent verification of the claims was not possible. Illia Novikov reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Israeli troops overnight killed a municipal employee who was sleeping in the town hall in Blida, southern Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency. The Israeli military confirmed the incident, saying that “during the procedures, an immediate threat against the troops was identified, and they fired to remove it.” Lebanese President Joseph Aoun instructed the army commander to confront any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called the incursion “a blatant attack on the institutions and sovereignty of the Lebanese state.” Maya Gebeily reports for Reuters.

Putin said yesterday that Russia had successfully tested Poseidon, a nuclear-powered super torpedo. The Poseidon is a new weapon that breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules, according to arms control experts. There are few confirmed details about the new weapon. Guy Falconbridge and Maxim Rodionov report for Reuters.

The Ta’ang National Liberation Army, a major ethnic rebel group in Myanmar, announced yesterday that it signed a ceasefire deal with Myanmar’s military following two days of China-mediated talks earlier this week. The military government did not immediately comment on the ceasefire. AP News reports.

The World Health Organization said yesterday that more than 450 patients and companions were massacred on Tuesday in the last operating hospital in El Fasher, Sudan. WHO did not confirm who was responsible for the killings. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, announced an investigation into violations committed by his soldiers during the capture of El Fasher. Declan Walsh reports for the New York Times; Barbara Plett Usher reports for BBC News.

Between December 2024 and July 2025, over 430,000 people in Syria were newly displaced, according to the United Nations. The biggest displacements were in the southern province of Sweida, where sectarian violence broke out in the summer. Decades-old property disputes and the Israeli occupation of land in southern Syria have also led to the displacement of people. Raja Abdulrahim and Reham Mourshed report for the New York Times.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Israel demanded that Google and Amazon include a “winking mechanism” in their 2021 Project Nimbus contracts, which would alert the Israeli government, through a coded payment system, when Israeli data had been disclosed to foreign courts or investigators, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian, as part of a joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call. Google and Amazon have both denied evading any legal obligations. Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham report for The Guardian.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Immigration authorities did not receive notice of a court order blocking the removal of Chanthila Souvannarath until after he had been deported to Laos, the Homeland Security Department said yesterday. The American Civil Liberties Union asked the federal judge to order Souvannarath’s immediate return to the United States, calling his deportation “unlawful.” Jim Mustian and Jack Brook report for AP News.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) yesterday said the state’s colleges and universities should “pull the plug” on the use of H-1B visas, adding that the jobs should go to U.S. citizens. Further details for the plan remain unclear. Vimal Patel and Alan Blinder report for the New York Times.

ICE allegedly furloughed most of its congressional relations team during the government shutdown, according to a letter sent to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons from 15 House Democrats. “ICE continues to conduct raids, make arrests, deny bonds, and execute removal orders, but the staff who would answer inquiries from congressional offices […] are furloughed, the letter says. Eric Bazil-Eimil reports for POLITICO.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. military yesterday killed another four people in a strike against a boat allegedly operated by a “designated terrorist organization” in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said yesterday. Helene Cooper and Robert Jimison report for the New York Times.

The House Armed Services Committee will be briefed this morning by Pentagon officials and Joint Chiefs of Staff on “counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean and Pacific,” Axios learned. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), who confirmed that the meeting today was going ahead, said yesterday that so far “zero evidence has been presented [to him] to justify the strikes that have taken place.” Andrew Solender and Kate Santaliz report.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

President Donald Trump said yesterday that the United States will share technology with South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told Trump in their meeting that South Korea’s current diesel-powered submarines have limits in tracking other countries’ submarine activities and that they have to resurface regularly to recharge. Chris Megerian and Josh Boak report for AP News.

700 U.S. troops, deployed in Romania, Germany, and Poland, will be withdrawn from Eastern Europe, U.S. and Romanian officials said yesterday. The U.S. Army command in Europe said that the 2nd Brigade Team will not be replaced after its scheduled rotation out of Eastern Europe, adding, “this is not an American withdrawal from Europe […] Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility.” Lynsey Chutel reports for the New York Times.

The U.S. government, across five Republican and Democratic administrations, has repeatedly allowed U.S. firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies, and surveillance companies, an AP News investigation has found. Lawmakers have repeatedly failed to close loopholes that allow China to circumvent export bans by using cloud services, third-party resellers, and holes in sanctions. Despite U.S. export rules around advanced AI chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024, according to a congressional committee report. Garance Burke, Dake Kang, and Byron Tau report for AP News.

“It was an amazing meeting,” Trump said today following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, “12 out of 10.” Trump said that he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China from 57% to 47% in exchange for Beijing taking action on illicit fentanyl trade and resuming U.S. soybean purchases. China also agreed to pause export controls on rare earths for a year, according to a statement from China’s commerce ministry. Trevor Hunnicutt reports for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Around 160 Republicans were reportedly investigated in the FBI’s Arctic Frost probe into Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, newly released documents show. The House Judiciary Committee said on social media that the new documents “reveal even further wide-ranging investigation by Biden’s DOJ to take down President Trump and his supporters.” Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted six people, including Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, on charges unsealed yesterday of interfering with a federal agent during a protest. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

Two federal prosecutors have been put on administrative leave after referring to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack as being committed by “thousands of people comprising mob rioters,” according to two sources. The description is found in a sentencing recommendation for Taylor Taranto, who was pardoned by Trump for his role in the riot but is awaiting sentencing this Friday for unrelated threats and firearms crimes. Yesterday evening, a revised memo was filed by a new set of prosecutors that had removed all references to the attack on the Capitol. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

FEDERALIZATION OF POLICING

The National Guard plans to train hundreds of troops in each state to be part of a rapid-response force focused on civil disturbance, two U.S. officials said yesterday. The sources said that states would be required to have a rapid-response force by the start of next year, with most states required to have 500 troops in the force. It is unclear how the force would be different from existing quick-reaction forces. Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump today ordered the U.S. military to resume nuclear weapons testing. “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,” Trump said on social media. Trevor Hunnicutt, Ismail Shakil, and Kanishka Singh report for Reuters.

Hegseth is expected to announce significant changes that could reshape how the Pentagon sends weapons to allies on November 7 at a meeting of defense industry executives, according to seven sources. The plan aims to accelerate weapons production and government-led arms purchases. Joe Gould and Paul McLeary report for POLITICO.

Three-star general Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, was pushed out of his role earlier this month following tensions with Hegseth, according to sources. The sources said that McGee frequently “pushed back” against Hegseth on issues such as Russia-Ukraine to operations in the Caribbean. “He has had a target on his back for a while now, “ one source said. A Pentagon spokesperson said, “General McGee is retiring, and the War Department is grateful for his service.” Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, and Haley Britzky report for CNN.

“I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told The Associated Press.
Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens.
The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture.
“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.","WASHINGTON -- A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns,” a group of 11 Democratic U.S. senators wrote in a letter Thursday to top immigration officials.

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

“I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told The Associated Press. “They want to keep the public in the dark.”

The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people — sometimes for hours — on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and six others.

The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

“When an organization like DHS doesn’t want transparency, it’s because they don’t want people to know what they’re doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.

In addition to the letter, U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told AP in a statement that she is working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the WRAP.

“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.

DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the WRAP. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said that ICE's practices “align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The AP found that DHS has paid the manufacturer of the WRAP, Safe Restraints Inc., $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE's use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

“The brutal, inhumane tactics of ICE continue to jeopardize people’s lives across the country,” Ramirez said. “ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability. That can’t go on.”

The suburban Chicago facility has been a flashpoint since U.S. President Donald Trump launched a stepped-up immigration enforcement operation in the area on September 8. Agents have responded to protests on multiple occasions by deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at demonstrators.

In the indictment, prosecutors allege that on September 26, Kat Abughazaleh – a former journalist who is running for a U.S. House seat as a Democrat – and five other activists protesting at the Broadview site crowded around a government vehicle driven by a federal agent, intentionally hindering its progress as the agent tried to drive into the facility.

According to prosecutors, the activists – Abughazaleh and Andre Martin, Michael Rabbitt, Catherine Sharp, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh – banged and pushed on the vehicle, scratched the word “pig” into its body, and broke a rear windshield wiper.

Attorneys Deny Accusations

Several attorneys for the protesters denied the accusations on Wednesday.

Molly Armour, an attorney for Sharp, who is the chief of staff for Chicago alderperson Andre Vasquez, said the charges against Sharp are an “effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Attorneys for Rabbitt and Walsh said their clients would plead not guilty to the charges. Abughazaleh told Reuters she would also plead not guilty.

Straw, a member of the Village Board for Chicago suburb Oak Park, said in a statement the charges would not “deter me from fulfilling my oath of office.”

The September 26 protest came weeks after the Trump administration announced the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” an immigration enforcement campaign it said was needed because of city and state “sanctuary” laws that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Law enforcement officers have been using the Broadview facility to process detainees, and protests at the site intensified after the Trump administration’s announcement.

Federal agents have shot pepper balls and deployed tear gas at protesters, leading to a lawsuit by journalists, activists and clergy members. U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month ordered agents involved in the Chicago crackdown to wear visible identification and limit their use of anti-riot weapons such as pepper balls and tear gas.

Chicago U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros said in a statement that federal officials “must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation, or threats.”

The case will appear before U.S. District Judge April Perry, who earlier this month blocked Trump from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops in Chicago.

Previous federal restrictions on immigration enforcement in or near sensitive areas, including health care establishments, were rescinded by the Trump administration in January.
The department did not respond to a request for comment on the state's new rules for health care facilities, which went into immediate effect.
Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare.
Many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have been in California, largely involving detained patients brought in for care.","In recent months, federal agents have camped out in the lobby of a Southern California hospital, guarded detained patients — sometimes shackled — in hospital rooms, and chased an immigrant landscaper into a surgical center.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have also shown up at community clinics. Health providers say that officers have tried to enter a parking lot hosting a mobile clinic, waved a machine gun in the faces of clinicians serving the homeless, and hauled a passerby into an unmarked car outside a community health center.

In response to such immigration enforcement activity in and around clinics and hospitals, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed SB 81, which prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters.

But while the bill received broad support from medical groups, health care workers, and immigrant rights advocates, legal experts say California can't stop federal authorities from carrying out duties in public places, which include hospital lobbies and general waiting areas, health facility parking lots, and surrounding neighborhoods — places where recent ICE activities have sparked outrage and fear. Previous federal restrictions on immigration enforcement in or near sensitive areas, including health care establishments, were rescinded by the Trump administration in January.

""The issue that states encounter is the supremacy clause,"" said Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law. She said the federal government does have the right to conduct enforcement activities, and there are limits to what the state can do to stop them.

California's law designates a patient's immigration status and birthplace as protected information, which like medical records cannot be disclosed to law enforcement without a warrant or court order. And it requires health care facilities to have clear procedures for handling requests from immigration authorities, including training staff to immediately notify a designated administrator or legal counsel if agents ask to enter a private area or review patient records.

Several other Democratic-led states have also taken up legislation to protect patients at hospitals and health centers. In May, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Protect Civil Rights Immigration Status bill, which penalizes hospitals for unauthorized sharing of information about people in the country illegally and bars ICE agents from entering private areas of health care facilities without a judicial warrant. In Maryland, a law requiring the attorney general to create guidance on keeping ICE out of health care facilities went into effect in June. New Mexico has instituted new patient data protections, and Rhode Island has prohibited health care facilities from asking patients about their immigration status.

Republican-led states have aligned with federal efforts to prevent health care spending on immigrants without legal authorization. Such immigrants are not eligible for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, but states do bill the federal government for emergency care in certain cases. Under a law that took effect in 2023, Florida requires hospitals that accept Medicaid to ask about a patient's legal status. In Texas, hospitals now have to report how much they spend on care for immigrants without legal authorization.

""Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said in issuing his executive order last year.

California's efforts to rein in federal enforcement come as the state, where more than a quarter of residents are foreign-born, has become a target of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Newsom signed SB 81 as part of a bill package prohibiting immigration agents from entering schools without a warrant, requiring law enforcement officers to identify themselves, and banning officers from wearing masks. SB 81 was passed on a party-line vote with no formal opposition.

""We're not North Korea,"" Newsom said during a September bill-signing ceremony. ""We're pushing back against these authoritarian tendencies and actions of this administration.""

Some supporters of the bill and legal experts said California's law can prevent ICE from violating existing patient privacy rights. Those include the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits searches without a warrant in places where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Valid warrants must be issued by a court and signed by a judge. But ICE agents frequently use administrative warrants to try to gain access to private areas they don't have the authority to enter, Genovese said.

""People don't always understand the difference between an administrative warrant, which is a meaningless piece of paper, versus a judicial warrant that is enforceable,"" Genovese said. Judicial warrants are rarely issued in immigration cases, she added.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it won't abide by California's mask ban or identification requirements for law enforcement officers, slamming them as unconstitutional. The department did not respond to a request for comment on the state's new rules for health care facilities, which went into immediate effect.

Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare. But the federal decision to rescind protections around sensitive areas, she said, ""has generated fear and uncertainty across the country."" Many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have been in California, largely involving detained patients brought in for care.

The California Nurses Association, the state's largest nurses union, was a co-sponsor of the bill and raised concerns about the treatment of Milagro Solis-Portillo, a 36-year-old Salvadoran woman who was under round-the-clock ICE surveillance at Glendale Memorial Hospital over the summer.

Union leaders also condemned the presence of agents at California Hospital Medical Center south of downtown Los Angeles. According to Anne Caputo-Pearl, a labor and delivery nurse and the chief union representative at the hospital, agents brought in a patient on Oct. 21 and remained in the patient's room for almost a week. The Los Angeles Times reported that a TikTok streamer, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, was taken to the hospital that day after he was wounded during an immigration enforcement operation in South Los Angeles.

The presence of ICE was intimidating for nurses and patients, Caputo-Pearl said, and prompted visitor restrictions at the hospital. ""We want better clarification,"" she said. ""Why is it that these agents are allowed to be in the room?""

Hospital and clinic representatives, however, said they are already following the law's requirements, which largely reinforce extensive guidance put out by state Attorney General Rob Bonta in December.

Community clinics throughout Los Angeles County, which serve over 2 million patients a year, including a large portion of immigrants, have been implementing the attorney general's guidelines for months, said Louise McCarthy, president and CEO of the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County. But she said the law should help ensure uniform standards across health facilities that clinics refer out to and reassure patients that procedures are in place to protect them.

Still, it can't prevent immigration raids from happening in the broader community, which have made some patients and even health workers afraid to venture outside, McCarthy said. Some incidents have occurred near clinics, including an arrest of a passerby outside a clinic in East Los Angeles, which a security guard caught on video, she said.

""We've had clinic staff say, 'Is it safe for me to go out?'"" she said.

At St. John's Community Health, a network of 24 community health centers and five mobile clinics in South Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, CEO Jim Mangia agreed that the new law can't prevent all immigration enforcement activity, but he said it does give clinics a tool to push back if agents show up, something his staff has already had to do.

Mangia said St. John's staff had two encounters with immigration agents over the summer. In one, he said, staff stopped armed officers from entering a gated parking lot at a drug and alcohol recovery center where doctors and nurses were seeing patients at a mobile health clinic.

Another occurred in July, when immigration agents descended upon MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles, in a show of force by the Trump administration. Mangia said masked officers in full tactical gear surrounded a street medicine tent where St. John's providers were tending to homeless patients, screamed at staff to get out, and pointed a gun at them. The providers were so shaken by the episode, Mangia said, that he had to bring in mental health professionals to help them feel safe going back out on the street.

A DHS spokesperson told CalMatters that in the rare instance where agents enter certain sensitive locations, officers would need ""secondary supervisor approval.""

Since then, St. John's has doubled down on providing support and training to staff and has offered patients afraid to go out the option of home medical visits and grocery deliveries. Patient fears and ICE activity have decreased since the summer, Mangia said, but with DHS planning to hire an additional 10,000 ICE agents, he doubts that will last.",https://www.news-medical.net/images/tags/TagImage-1295-45841047278807879412-620x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 10:17:11.261212

The automatic extension policy has since been periodically maintained and expanded—most recently from 180 days to 540 days—specifically to stabilize employment during prolonged adjudication backlogs.","Beginning October 30, 2025, noncitizens who file to renew their EADs will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization or EAD validity while USCIS adjudicates their renewal application.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), has issued an interim final rule eliminating the automatic extension of employment authorization documents (EADs) for most noncitizens who timely file renewal applications. This policy change will apply to EAD renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025.

Key Change

Beginning October 30, 2025, noncitizens who file to renew their EADs will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization or EAD validity while USCIS adjudicates their renewal application. Limited exceptions will remain, including extensions required by federal statute and those issued through Federal Register notices for temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries.

EADs that already received an automatic extension prior to October 30, 2025, will not be affected by this rule.

DHS Rationale

DHS states that the policy is intended to enhance screening and vetting by requiring USCIS to affirmatively reevaluate an individual’s eligibility before extending work authorization. USCIS leadership emphasized a return to stricter review standards, noting that authorization to work in the United States is a “privilege, not a right.”

Impact on Employers and Foreign National Employees

This rule is expected to have significant compliance and operational consequences, including:

Increased risk of gaps in work authorization during renewal processing.

Heightened I-9 compliance exposure if internal tracking systems are not proactively updated.

Greater urgency to file renewal applications up to 180 days before expiration (as recommended by USCIS).

Business continuity risk, particularly for employers with EAD-dependent workforce populations.

Foreign nationals whose employment authorization is incident to their status will continue to have work authorization if their status is valid, even if their EAD is expired. For example, individuals in L-2S with an expired EAD but valid L-2 status will continue to hold work authorization. These employees can present a valid I-797 or I-94 to their employers upon expiration of their EAD.

Recommended Employer Action Items

To reduce risk, employers should:

Identify and audit current employees holding EADs as early as possible.

Update I-9 and immigration compliance protocols—reverification must occur by the current EAD expiration date; post-October 30, 2025, I-797C receipt notices can no longer be relied upon to extend work authorization.

Train HR and onboarding teams on the rule and revised timelines.

Encourage employees to file renewal applications at the earliest permissible window (180 days before expiration).

Coordinate with immigration counsel immediately if relying on TPS-related or statute-based automatic extensions.

EAD Categories Impacted (for Renewal Filings on or After October 30, 2025)

The following categories were previously eligible for automatic extensions and will now be affected:

A03: Refugees

A05: Asylees

A07: Certain parents/dependent children of special immigrants

A08: Certain citizens of Micronesia/Marshall Islands/Palau

A10: Granted withholding of removal

A12/C19: TPS beneficiaries and TPS applicants with temporary treatment benefits

A17: E-1/E-2/E-3 dependent spouses

A18: L-2 dependent spouses

C08: Pending asylum applicants

C09: Pending adjustment of status applicants

C10: Suspension of deportation/cancellation of removal applicants

C16: Creation of record applicants

C20/C22/C24: Legalization applicants

C26: H-4 dependent spouses

C31: VAWA self-petitioners

Historical Background

The automatic EAD extension was originally created to prevent gaps in work authorization for individuals with pending, timely filed renewal applications due to USCIS case processing delays—an issue that had triggered extensive employer advocacy and litigation, including Edakunni v. Mayorkas (2022). In response, DHS first issued a temporary 540-day automatic extension in 2022 to provide immediate relief and workforce continuity. That framework was made permanent in January 2025, with DHS citing the need to support the U.S. economy, protect employers from workforce disruption and reduce uncertainty and anxiety for foreign national employees. The automatic extension policy has since been periodically maintained and expanded—most recently from 180 days to 540 days—specifically to stabilize employment during prolonged adjudication backlogs.

Next Steps

We are closely monitoring implementation guidance and any further clarification from USCIS. Employers should immediately begin reviewing workforce planning and compliance processes to prevent future authorization lapses once the rule takes effect.

For case-specific guidance or assistance in updating compliance protocols, seek immigration counsel.

""A person can interfere with a federal officer doing their job through things like even intimidation or some kind of other interference that is short of actual physical involvement,"" Schwinn said.

But, in his legal opinion, Schwinn says the Trump administration has stretched the limits of what obstruction means when they have prosecuted protesters.

""If the Department of Justice seeks to lodge a charge, they very well may do it, but then it's a different question entirely, whether that'll survive the legal system,"" Schwinn said.

Schwinn says charges likely won't survive, if it is proved federal agents were acting unlawfully while doing their jobs.

In the meantime, Enriquez is not taking any chances. He advises his volunteers who look out for ICE to no longer follow the agents in caravans, stay six feet away and don't engage.

He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, which he said allowed too many people into the country and threatened the social fabric of the United States.
“We cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said.
“The left is already going to do it regardless of whether we do it.” Vance was introduced by Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, in one of her first public appearances since she took over her husband’s role leading Turning Point.

Vance took questions from students at the University of Mississippi at an event organized by Turning Point USA, stepping into the role of debater that was so often performed by the organization’s slain founder, Charlie Kirk.

Vance said the optimal number of legal immigrants to admit is “far less than what we’ve been accepting,” but he did not offer a firm number when pressed by a woman who questioned his stance. He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, which he said allowed too many people into the country and threatened the social fabric of the United States.

“When something like that happens, you’ve got to allow your own society to cohere a little bit, to build a sense of common identity, for all the newcomers — the ones who are going to stay — to assimilate into American culture,” Vance said. “Until you do that, you’ve got to be careful about any additional immigration, in my view.”

Vance also spoke forcefully about avoiding American deaths in “unnecessary foreign conflicts,” touting President Donald Trump’s Middle East diplomacy and the strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the U.S. steps up military pressure on Venezuela and strikes boats that the Trump administrations says are transporting drugs.

Asked whether Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities will lead to a future president using that government power against conservatives, he said his allies shouldn’t be worried about Trump’s exercise of executive power. He justified Trump’s targeting of his political enemies by pointing to his arrest during Biden’s administration. He was charged with illegally keeping classified documents after his first term and attempting to subvert the 2020 election he lost, but the charges were dismissed after he was elected to his second term a year ago.

“We cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said. “The left is already going to do it regardless of whether we do it.”

Vance was introduced by Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, in one of her first public appearances since she took over her husband’s role leading Turning Point.

“Being on campus right now, for me, is a spiritual reclaiming of territory,” she said, reflecting on Kirk’s love of visiting universities and his mission to move campuses to the right.

Wearing a white “freedom” shirt like the one her husband wore when he was shot, Erika Kirk urged young Christian conservatives to courageously fight for their beliefs and not fear the social consequences.

“If you’re worried about losing a friend—I lost my friend,” she said. “I lost my best friend.”

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by US District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on September 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on September 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring US Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-26t193700z-946293913-rc2nzgaum92w-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-30 04:16:43.922760

He also polls in the negatives on abortion (-17 points), education (-19 points), jobs/the economy (-22 points), climate change/environment (-22 points), and inflation/consumer prices (-31 points).

His recent executive actions are also viewed poorly by the American public — he receives a net-31-point approval rating on his decision to cancel trade talks with Canada, a -36-point rating on his demolition of the East Wing of the White House to build a new ballroom, a -44-point rating for his choice to commute the sentence of George Santos, and -44-point rating on his demands to be compensated over past federal investigations into his actions.

Meanwhile, movements against Trump are viewed positively by a plurality of respondents in the poll. Asked about how they view the nationwide “No Kings” protests, 49 percent of Americans said they approved of the demonstrations, while only 33 percent said they disapproved. (Eighteen percent said they weren’t sure how they felt.) Close to 1 in 10 Americans (8 percent) also said they themselves participated in the protests.

That number is significant because of a concept called the “3.5 percent rule.” According to research at Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr-Ryan Center for Human Rights, nonviolent protests that engage at least 3.5 percent of the population have a higher likelihood of accomplishing their aims — indeed, worldwide movements that reach that threshold “have never failed to bring about change,” researchers said.

Despite his dismal approval ratings, Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this week that he has “the best Polling Numbers that I have ever received.” He further claimed that “Radical Left Losers are taking fake ads, not showing REAL Polls, but rather saying that I’m Polling at low levels,” and that such ads “should not be allowed to run.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_1029-trump-polls.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 06:01:56.049951

(AP) — A federal trial over whether President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, was underway Wednesday, with police officials expected to testify that federal agents at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building have inflamed protests in recent weeks through excessive force.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, will preside over the trial in Portland. The trial stems from a lawsuit filed by the city and state against the Trump administration in a bid to block the troop deployment.

Immergut has already issued two temporary restraining orders in the case blocking the troops pending further litigation. She found that Trump had failed to show he had met the conditions set out by Congress for using the military domestically. She described his assessment of the situation in Portland, which Trump called “war ravaged,” as “simply untethered to the facts.”

One of Immergut’s orders was paused last week by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the case before an 11-judge panel.

The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — are pushing back. They argue the president has not met the legal requirements to deploy troops and doing so would violate states’ sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because protests have impeded law enforcement operations.

Portland’s ICE building outside downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June when police declared one demonstration a riot. Smaller clashes have also occurred since then, and federal officers have fired tear gas to clear crowds, which at times have included counterprotesters and livestreamers.

During the trial, witnesses are expected to take the stand for both sides and face cross-examination. The federal defendants will call officials from ICE, the Department of Defense and the Federal Protective Service, the agency that provides security for federal buildings.

The administration argues that it has had to shuffle Department of Homeland Security agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, showing that the city has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces — one of the conditions set by Congress for calling out the National Guard. It has also characterized the protests as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” — another of the conditions.

The state and city argue that federal officers have at times used force that appears to be “needless and arbitrary.”

“They have deployed tear gas and pepper balls on small numbers of nonviolent protesters outside of the ICE building repeatedly, in some cases without apparent need or provocation, and without first exhausting de-escalation or other less-aggressive options,” the plaintiffs wrote in a trial brief.

Portland police have also been “gassed by federal law enforcement” and, on at least one occasion, hit with a crowd-control projectile, the brief said.

The Trump administration says the Portland Police Bureau has been unwilling to help control the protests, describing authorities in a trial brief as “unhelpful and at times hostile.”

“The record is replete with evidence of the PPB failing to provide assistance when federal officials have requested it,” Justice Department attorneys wrote.

The police say they have made arrests when crimes have been committed, but that they also must respect protesters’ First Amendment rights.

Communication between local and federal authorities worsened as federal agents surged to the building “without a clear command and control structure,” the state and city said.

“To list just one illustrative example, at one point pepper balls were shot in the direction of a PPB officer,” the trial brief said. “When confronted, federal officials responded, ‘help or get out of the way.’”

In Chicago, police officers have similarly been exposed to tear gas deployed by federal officials against protesters.

The Portland trial is expected to last three days.

Defendants enmeshed in the wave of online wiretapping litigation scored a victory on October 17, 2025, when Judge Vince Chhabria invoked the rule of lenity and granted summary judgment for the defendant on California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) claims in Jane Doe v. Eating Recovery Center (ERC) LLC, case no. 3:23-cv-05561-VC (N.D. Cal.), Dkt. 167. While it remains to be seen whether other courts will follow suit, Judge Chhabria’s order will doubtlessly be useful for defendants advancing similar lenity-based arguments in wiretapping cases going forward.

Background

California enacted the CIPA in 1967 to regulate wiretapping and eavesdropping on confidential communications. CIPA is primarily a criminal statute, but it also includes a civil private right of action with a statutory damages provision that has provoked waves of litigation since the early 2000s, first as to companies’ call recording practices, and then as to various internet technologies. See Cal. Penal Code. § 637.2. The most recent wave of litigation has focused on consumer-facing websites that use commonplace advertising technologies like cookies, pixels, and similar tracking software. The ensuing wave of litigation has overwhelmed website operators over the last two years, with many facing multiple demand letters and cases across both state and federal courts in California. And it has obliged courts to grapple with how to apply a nearly sixty-year-old statute to internet technologies that did not exist when it was drafted. Given the challenges inherent in such an exercise, federal and state courts remain split on a number of important legal issues, and uncertainty continues.

The rule of lenity can be an attractive defense for defendants in wiretapping cases. That rule, which is grounded in core due process principles, instructs courts to interpret criminal statutes like CIPA narrowly and construe ambiguities in the defendant’s favor. Given CIPA’s age and opaque language, the rule of lenity defense is an important defense to CIPA wiretapping cases. But so far, court rulings have been mixed: several federal courts have decided not to apply the rule of lenity in these cases.

Judge Chhabria’s Order in Doe v. Eating Recovery Center LLC

A positive legal development occurred last week for defendants facing the recent tsunami of CIPA litigation when, in Doe v. Eating Recovery Center LLC, Judge Chhabria of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California applied the rule of lenity in a CIPA case—noting that “courts are issuing conflicting rulings, and companies have no way of telling whether their online business activities will subject them to liability”—and granted summary judgment to a company offering an eating disorders website.

Doe v. ERC was a run-of-the-mill wiretapping case. ERC used the Meta Pixel on its website from 2019-2024 to improve outreach for treatment services. The Pixel’s default configuration sent Meta page URLs, time-on-page, referrer paths, and certain button clicks. The plaintiff alleged that ERC violated Section 631 of CIPA by sharing that data with Meta. Section 631(a) of CIPA imposes liability on anyone who:

“intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable, or instrument”;

“willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same is in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent from, or received at any place within this state”;

“uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to communicate in any way, any information so obtained”; or

“aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in this section.”

Cal. Penal Code § 631(a).

In Doe v. ERC, the plaintiff alleged that Meta violated the second clause of CIPA because it read, attempted to read, or attempted to learn the contents of her communications with ERC while they were in transit, and ERC in turn violated the fourth clause by aiding or conspiring with Meta. On summary judgment, ERC challenged that theory as deficient in two respects: (1) the data that Meta received was not the “contents” of the plaintiff’s communications with ERC; and (2) even if it was, Meta did not attempt to read the contents of the communications while they were in transit.

Judge Chhabria ruled for the plaintiff on the first issue but for ERC on the second issue. He found that the undisputed evidence established that Meta did not read, attempt to read, or attempt to learn the “contents” of a communication while they were “in transit” as required by Section 631(a). In doing so, he rejected the plaintiff’s theory that merely intercepting data with the intent to analyze it later is an “attempt to learn” while in transit, cautioning that this reading would collapse Section 631(a) into Section 632 (CIPA’s “recording device” provision).

But the heart of the court’s analysis concerned the rule of lenity, which Judge Chhabria cited as a key reason for not adopting the plaintiff’s broader interpretation of CIPA’s “in transit” language. He began by lamenting CIPA’s “badly drafted” text and the current state of litigation under it. Order at 6. He also noted that, when courts are called upon to apply CIPA’s “obtuse language” to “new technologies,” “it’s often borderline impossible to determine whether a defendant’s online conduct fits within the language of the statute.” Order at 1; see also id. at 9 (“[T]he statutory language was drafted with very different technology in mind, and it does not map properly onto the internet.”). Because CIPA contains ambiguous language and is a criminal statute, Judge Chhabria agreed with ERC that CIPA should be interpreted narrowly and that any ambiguity should be resolved in the defendants’ favor. Applying that rule, Judge Chhabria granted ERC’s motion for summary judgment, holding that “it would not be appropriate to interpret the ‘in-transit’ requirement of Section 631(a) so broadly as to cover [ERC’s] conduct.” Order at 12.

Judge Chhabria closed with an appeal to the California legislature: he urged it “to step up” and “bring CIPA into the modern age and to speak clearly about how the kinds of activities at issue in this case should be treated.” Order at 2. But until that happens, he concluded that “courts should generally resolve CIPA’s many ambiguities in favor of” defendants. Id.

***

Judge Chhabria’s invocation of the rule of lenity is a positive result for defendants in website tracking and Pixel cases. The opinion may serve as a template for other courts in employing the rule of lenity to help stem the tide of wiretapping cases filling court dockets and may exert further pressure on the California legislature to clarify their decades-old wiretapping statute.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14376_4544.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 03:56:37.718773

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

Abughazaleh and five others are accused of blocking a Department of Homeland Security vehicle from carrying out deportations, banging and scratching on the window.

“It was further part of the conspiracy that Abughazaleh joined the crowd at the front of the Government Vehicle, and with her hands on the hood braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle, hindering and impeding Agent A and the vehicle from proceeding to the BSSA,” the court documents read. “[Abughazaleh] forcibly impeded, intimidated, and interfered with an officer of the United States.”

Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old Palestinian American House candidate in Illinois’s 9th congressional district, condemned the indictment.

Federal forces have been particularly violent and confrontational in Chicago, where the Trump administration is carrying out its “Operation Midway Blitz” crackdown on immigration, resulting in shows of dissent from local residents. Abughazaleh herself was body-slammed and beaten by ICE at a previous protest in September. Other protesters in Chicago, such as Reverend David Black and United Methodist Reverend Hannah Kardon, have also been shot at with pepper balls.

“ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and tear-gassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors, and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“This case targets our right to protest, speak freely, and associate with anyone who disagrees with the government,” Abughazaleh added. “We cannot diminish ourselves in the face of these attacks. That’s why we have to unite and stand up for humanity, our rights, and everyone terrorized by Trump’s lawless secret police.”

Abughazaleh and the other five protesters face charges carrying up to eight years in prison if convicted.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admitted Wednesday that he doesn’t have “sufficient” evidence that pregnant people’s use of Tylenol can cause autism in their children.

While speaking about President Donald Trump’s controversial TrumpRx program, Kennedy made a crucial clarification about the administration’s recent claims linking autism to Tylenol, the number one drug prescribed to pregnant patients for pain relief and fever reduction.

“The causative association between Tylenol given in pregnancy and perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism, but it is very suggestive,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy’s comment came just one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Kenvue, Tylenol’s parent company, alleging that it failed to alert consumers that using its product during pregnancy posed a “significantly increased risk of autism” and ADHD. But that claim isn’t true by Kennedy’s own admission.

Several large studies have found “associations” between substantial use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and higher rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but experts have stressed that these studies are not conclusive. During a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Kennedy cited a number of studies that allegedly support his suspicions about Tylenol but said the existing evidence was “not proof.”

“We’re doing the studies to make the proof,” he admitted—which made the whole thing sound more like a hunch than anything else.

Speaking on Wednesday, Kennedy suggested that pregnant women should consult with their doctors before taking Tylenol, but generally, the Trump administration hasn’t been quite that diplomatic with its recommendations.

In September, Trump seemed to suggest that all Americans should stop taking acetaminophen (though he could hardly pronounce it), especially pregnant women and young children.

“You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words a fever that’s very, very dangerous and ideally a doctor’s decision because I think you shouldn’t take it,” he said.

And as recently as Sunday, Trump was still urging people, “DON’T USE TYLENOL UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

“DON’T GIVE TYLENOL TO YOUR YOUNG CHILD FOR VIRTUALLY ANY REASON,” the president, who has no medical training, wrote on Truth Social.

Toyota has denied President Trump’s recent claim that the company recently pledged to invest $10 billion in the United States.

Trump bragged about the $10 billion figure at least twice during his trip to Asia this week, visiting an American naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, and meeting with the country’s newly minted right-wing Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday.

“Yesterday I was with Mr. Toyoda in Japan, and he’s just announced he’s gonna spend, uh, they’re gonna spend $10 billion, and they’re gonna build new car plants,” Trump said Tuesday, referring to the company’s CEO, Akio Toyoda. “And they’re gonna build ’em in numerous states, about six or seven different states.”

No such deal has been made, as Toyota made sure to clarify. On Wednesday, company executive Hiroyuki Ueda basically confirmed that Trump was either making it up or mixing it up with a deal from his first term nearly eight years ago.

“During the first Trump administration, I think the figure was roughly around $10 billion, so while we didn’t say the same scale, we did explain that we’ll keep investing and providing employment as before,” Ueda told reporters. “So, probably because of that context, the figure of about $10 billion came up. Therefore, we didn’t specifically say that we’ll invest $10 billion over the next few years.”

More on Trump’s Japan visit:

It seems that acting U.S. Attorney Bilal “Bill” Essayli couldn’t care less whether he was illegally appointed by President Donald Trump—or maybe he just didn’t read a judge’s order closely enough.

U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright ruled Tuesday night that Essayli had been “unlawfully serving” as the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California and was “disqualified” from serving in that role. Essayli was, however, properly appointed as a special attorney and could serve as “First Assistant United States Attorney.”

Essayli took to X soon after to assure his followers that everything would remain the same.

“For those who didn’t read the entire order, nothing is changing. I continue serving as the top federal prosecutor in the Central District of California. It’s an honor and privilege to serve President Trump and Attorney General Bondi, and I look forward to advancing their agenda for the American People,” he wrote on X, posting a screenshot of the judge’s order.

Incidentally, the excerpt he shared relayed that he was “never lawfully serving as Acting United States Attorney.”

Journalist Adam Klasfield pointed out the admission on X, adding: “If he’s claiming First Assistant US Attorney is the same thing (it isn’t), he shouldn’t mind identifying himself accurately.”

While the positions are functionally similar, some requests require the signature of the U.S. attorney specifically.

The Trump administration has attempted to stretch the 120-day limits on interim appointments to avoid embarrassing Senate confirmation votes. Trump’s appointments of Alina Habba in New Jersey and Lindsey Halligan in Virginia have both summoned legal challenges.

While illegally serving as acting U.S. attorney, Essayli provided cover for the Trump administration’s federal law enforcement crackdown in Los Angeles and pursued dozens of (mostly failed) cases against protesters opposing immigration raids earlier this year. Seabright declined to toss the cases Essayli had been prosecuting because they had been “lawfully signed by other attorneys,” and there was no evidence of due process violations.

The speaker of the House is apparently in favor of totalitarian rule, so long as Donald Trump is in charge.

The government has been shut down for more than 27 days now. But instead of working to bridge the partisan gulf and restore critical social services to millions of Americans and paychecks to thousands of federal workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson is still hyperfixated on the nationwide No Kings protest that occurred two weekends ago.

Delivering what he clearly believed was a very clever “gotcha,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday that the country would be better off if Trump were king.

“They had a rally a couple weeks ago, they tried to portray President Trump as a king. We pointed out again, the obvious truth, that if Trump was a king then the government would be open,” Johnson smirked. “He’s been trying to do that.”

Johnson then appealed to low-income Americans with his pro-monarchy pitch, arguing that if Trump had singular authority, then he would have already advanced funding for SNAP benefits, which are set to expire November 1. (A coalition of 22 states sued the Trump administration Tuesday for allegedly withholding federal funds set aside specifically to continue the program through the month of November.)

The lower chamber leader has been complaining about the No Kings protests since before they even took place on October 18, trying every which way to leverage the movement to redirect attention away from his failures at the dais. He has falsely claimed that the peaceful, anti-authoritarian protest series—which produced the largest single-day protest in U.S. history—was actually advocating for violence against political officials.

By and large, the multi-month protest series has advocated for Americans’ First Amendment rights and rejected Trump’s agenda. Signage related to the event has emphasized the fight for democracy and against dictatorships. In the same political vein, No Kings participants have used their enormous visual footprint to fight against Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s unchecked authority, turn out for universal health care, condemn the release of disgraced former Representative George Santos, and raise national awareness on the rise of American fascism.

Meanwhile, Johnson appears to be doing everything in his power to keep the government closed. Week after week, he has sent representatives home instead of bringing them in to try to come up with a solution to the shutdown. When asked Wednesday if he would bring lawmakers back to negotiate government funding past November 1, he described doing so as a “futile exercise.” He then blamed Democrats for refusing to pass a continuing resolution that would strip health care away from millions of Americans.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is pretending that he’s never even heard about an ICE agent firing at a faith leader’s face—even though he was first asked about it two weeks ago.

During a press conference Wednesday, Religion News Service’s Jack Jenkins asked Johnson whether an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shooting a pepper ball at a Presbyterian minister outside an ICE facility in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, had infringed on the faith leader’s freedom of religion.*

“I can’t comment on any of those instances. I haven’t seen or heard any of those videos,” Johnson replied.

But the House speaker had already used that line earlier this month. “I’ve not seen [ICE] cross the line yet,” Johnson said when he was first asked about the widely publicized incident.

Jenkins immediately caught the lie Wednesday. “I asked this question, and you’ll hear me say ‘yes you have’ here—because Johnson was already *directly asked* about one of these instances in one of earlier shutdown press conferences,” he wrote on X.

It’s not clear what’s worse: the idea that Johnson would hear a report about the use of excessive force against a faith leader and never think about it again—or that he actually expects Americans to believe he never heard about it in the first place.

But Johnson wasn’t done. For a guy who won’t comment on a video he claims not to have seen, the Louisiana Republican sure said a lot.

“Religious freedom does not extend and give you the right to get in the face of an ICE officer and assault them, if indeed that was what happened there,” Johnson continued Wednesday.

Crucially, video of the incident shows that the agent was standing on the facility’s roof firing at a clearly unarmed priest standing on the ground. But Johnson is so adamant about the alleged abuse of law enforcement by radical activists that he’s willing to take some creative liberties.

In his daily propaganda press conferences, the House speaker has embraced a sort of strategic blindness when it comes to the misdeeds of Donald Trump’s administration. Johnson even played dumb when asked about a report that ICE had detained scores of U.S. citizens, including children.

President Donald Trump has cleared the way for his multiple large-scale construction projects by demolishing the commission that would oversee them.

All six members of the Commission on Fine Arts received an email from the White House presidential personnel office Tuesday night notifying them that they had been terminated, effective immediately, The Washington Post reported.

An official told the Post that Trump planned to replace the members. “We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump’s ‘America First’ policies,” they said.

The official’s statement seems to suggest that Trump is seeking a slate of MAGA commissioners to green-light his every whim, as he attempts to unilaterally transform the nation’s capital into a shrine to his own triumph. The previous commissioners had been appointed to four-year terms by President Joe Biden.

The commission was established by Congress in 1910 to advise the federal government on the art, design, and architectural development of Washington, including major projects at the White House. It’s not clear whether Trump intends to run his plans for a $300 million ballroom or his ridiculous “Arc de Trump” monument past the new commission.

The latest shake-ups come as Trump lays waste to the White House’s East Wing, after promising his grand designs for a space to host diplomats would leave the original building untouched.

It also seems that Trump has allowed his “builder in chief” status to eclipse his actual duties. The president has reportedly become consumed by his large-scale remodeling at the White House, wandering away from his work to survey renovations.

California is rapidly turning its education system, from K-12 schools to colleges, into a benefit for illegal aliens. A slew of recent state laws limit cooperation with federal immigration officials undermining enforcement, placing foreign nationals above American students, and increasing taxpayer costs.

Senate Bill (SB) 580, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, forces schools, libraries, courthouses, health facilities, and shelters to develop and implement policies that actively restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This law violates 8 U.S. Code § 1373 by prohibiting these institutions from sharing immigration status information with federal officials. Beyond the legal concerns, SB 580 adds layers of bureaucracy and compliance costs that California taxpayers will ultimately bear.

In addition to SB 580, an additional four bills were recently enacted that establish new protections to prioritize illegal aliens over American students and lawful residents.

SB 98, signed by Governor Newsom on September 20, 2025, requires colleges and universities to alert students about immigration enforcement activities on campus, maintain strict confidentiality regarding students’ national origin or immigration status, and provide legal assistance and resources for immigration matters. California’s public universities are now expected to function as early warning systems and legal aid centers for those sought by federal law enforcement.

SB 307, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, requires the California State University and University of California systems to implement measures to ensure that foreign nationals retain their academic status even if they cannot attend classes due to immigration enforcement actions. Additionally, it creates taxpayer-funded “Dreamer Resource Liaisons” that guarantees assistance and eligibility for illegal aliens seeking financial aid or non-resident tuition exemptions. American students already face fierce competition for limited financial aid and university resources; now, they must compete against foreign nationals who receive state-sponsored advocacy and support.

Assembly Bill (AB) 419, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, prohibits local educational agencies from collecting national origin and immigration status information. The law requires schools to report any immigration enforcement inquiries and mandates multilingual communications that inform all students about their educational “rights” regardless of legal status. This measure effectively prevents schools from cooperating with federal authorities while simultaneously advertising California’s education system as a safe haven for illegal immigration.

AB 495, also signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, bars daycare centers and state preschool programs from inquiring about citizenship or immigration status and requires these facilities to establish policies that severely restrict cooperation with immigration enforcement efforts.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Migrants%2C%20Money%2C%20Cracked%20Flag%2C%20School%20Bus.jpg.webp?itok=4Qm0Fglx,N,,2025-10-29 23:56:35.975173

Trump has asked the justice department to pay him $230m in damages, the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.

In the Mar-a-Lago complaint, Trump argues he was subject to invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution and abuse of process related to the case.

The effort has set off alarm bells and seen as a staggering act of corruption because the two justice department officials with power to sign off on the claims are Trump appointees and allies. House Democrats sent a letter to the justice department this week calling the effort “blatantly illegal and unconstitutional”.

Trump is seeking compensation under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), a law that allows people to seek damages from the federal government. The law requires claimants to first file an administrative claim for damages; the government then has six months to either settle the claim or deny it. After six months, or if the claim is denied, the claimant can file a lawsuit. The government has not responded to either of Trump’s claims, but Trump has not filed a lawsuit. It is extremely difficult for a claimant to successfully recover damages under the law.

The New York Times published the form Trump used to make the claim about the Mar-a-Lago raid – the only claim that has become public so far. Trump requested the government pay him $100m in compensation. Additionally, a memo attached to the claim requested $100m in punitive damages and says the president suffered $15m in actual harm due to legal costs connected to the case. It is not clear why the claim cover sheet seeks $100m in damages while the memo outlines $115m in requested damages.

Trump’s legal costs in the case were covered by his Super Pac, Save America. Trump retained six lawyers for himself in the classified documents case, including Todd Blanche, who is now the deputy attorney general.

Trump told reporters last week he would donate any money from a possible settlement to charity. The president has a history of making charitable promises that never materialize.

The amount Trump is demanding far exceeds the amount typically paid out by the justice department in administrative settlements under the FTCA. A Guardian review of FTCA claims filed against the federal government that were administratively settled from 2020 to 2024 shows the average settlement amount to be about $51,684. The largest administrative settlement during that time period was for $3.55m. The 139 administrative settlements the justice department reached last year with victims of Larry Nassar, the doctor who abused Olympic gymnasts and many others, totalled $138.7m.

Those seeking a settlement usually aim high because their initial request sets a ceiling on what they can recover, said Gregory Sisk, a law professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. Still, he said, the amount Trump is requesting was difficult to take seriously.

“Typically, someone who was asking for this amount of money, it would be very quickly rejected, because it would be thought of as absurd to request that amount,” he said. “I cannot think of any prior claim, at least at this early stage, that has been settled that involves money approaching that level.”

Cases including a request for more than $4m typically have involved children who had been injured and had a lifetime of medical expenses and lost earnings capacity, according to Rupa Bhattacharyya, a former justice department attorney who worked on FTCA claims, adding that it was also extremely rare for the government to agree to such a big settlement without litigating it.

“A lot of the cases that get settled are small potatoes. If someone slips and falls in the Smithsonian and breaks their arm, they might settle that claim because it’s just not worth it to litigate it,” she said. “But big-money cases, it’s pretty rare for claims to be settled at the administrative stage because before the government pays out taxpayer funds, it wants to ensure that it in fact has a reason to do so.”

Normally, it would be easy for justice department lawyers to reject the overwhelming majority of the money Trump is requesting. The FTCA does not allow for punitive damages.

“It is a frivolous claim to ask for punitive damages under the FTCA. The statute is explicit,” said Sisk.

A key provision of the FTCA immunizes government officials when they are exercising their discretion within the bounds of a policy set by the government. The search warrants of Mar-a-Lago were approved by a magistrate judge.

“Since it was pursued pursuant to a warrant that had been issued by a judge who found that there was probable cause, that would be a pretty high hill to climb for the typical individual who claimed that they had been subjected to trespass by a search, even if the government ultimately concluded we’re not going to bring charges. Or charges were brought and you were acquitted,” Sisk said.

He added he would be surprised if there were many previous cases where anyone who was the subject of a search conducted after obtaining proper probable cause was able to obtain a settlement from the government.

Experts also questioned whether Trump would be able to recover attorneys’ fees in the case. The FTCA caps what an attorney gets paid as a portion of the plaintiff’s recovery, Bhattacharyya said.

Outside of the FTCA, when litigants try to get adversaries to pay their cases in court, judges typically investigate whether the amount billed was reasonable.

None of that may matter. The deputy attorney general and the associate attorney general both have the authority to require FTCA claims above $4m. Both positions are currently held by men who are Trump allies. Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended Trump in the criminal cases against him. Save America also paid legal fees for Stanley Woodward, the associate attorney general who leads the department’s civil division, and who defended Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in the classified documents case. Both men have final authority on sign-offs for the settlements.

This has raised alarm and created serious legal ethics problems, said Joseph Tirrell, who was the top ethics official at the justice department until he was fired earlier this year. He is suing the department for wrongful termination.

“There’s just nobody that can make this decision, career or political appointee, who’s not going to be chock-full of ethical conundrums here,” he said. “In this case, there’s nobody to kick it up to. The attorney general has just as significant conflicts, if not more so than Mr Woodward and Mr Blanche. And, frankly, the risk of any or all of them being fired if they don’t make a decision that comports with the president’s wishes is just as significant and applies to every employee in the department of justice, if not every employee in the executive branch.”

“In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials,” said Chad Gilmartin, a justice department spokesperson. That was of little reassurance to Tirrell.

“Can you imagine an ethics official, a career official, making this decision without thinking, ‘Well, if I don’t tell them what they want to hear, I’m going to lose my job’?” he said.

There also may be little information provided to the public once a settlement is reached. Details of administrative settlements are not typically disclosed to the public, though some basic details are included in a year-end report to Congress.

In an essay published this week, Bhattacharyya outlined a solution for the justice department to handle Trump’s claim: do nothing.

The FTCA does not require the department to respond to Trump’s request for a settlement, and the president can pursue it in court, where he would have to more fully flesh out his arguments before a judge and offer evidence in the public eye.

“If President Trump wants to press his legal claims in a court of law, let him try, as thousands of tort claimants do every year,” she wrote.

“Settling President Trump’s administrative claims before there has been any opportunity to test or defend those claims should be a non-starter for the justice department if it is to retain any integrity, a commitment to doing justice, and a sense of responsibility for the US taxpayer dollars with which they have been entrusted.”

A Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois has been indicted on federal charges relating to an incident in which protesters allegedly attacked an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicle outside a Chicago suburb facility last month.

Katherine ""Kat"" Abughazaleh, 26, who has branded herself a ""Gen Z influencer"" running for Congress in Illinois’s 9th District, is accused of conspiracy to impede or injure an ICE officer while on duty in Broadview, Illinois, Sept. 26, according to an indictment unsealed Wednesday.

Abughazaleh had been expected to win the Democratic nomination to succeed Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., 81, who is retiring.

Five other protesters were also indicted with Abughazaleh, including one of her associates and two other political candidates.

The defendants include Andre Martin, described in the indictment as an associate who worked for or with her; Michael Rabbit, a Democratic committee person in Chicago’s 45th Ward; Catherine Sharp, a candidate for the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh, who are listed as Illinois residents.

According to the indictment, a group of individuals surrounded a government vehicle with ""intent to hinder or impede"" operations by ""aggressively"" banging and pushing the car. The protesters allegedly etched derogatory messages including the word ""PIG"" into the car, broke a side mirror and damaged a rear windshield wiper.

The indictment also alleges that Abughazaleh moved to the front of the government vehicle during the confrontation, pressing her hands against the hood and using her body to block its path.

""No one is above the law, and no one has the right to obstruct it,"" Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, said in a statement Wednesday. ""The Department of Justice will never tolerate such conduct and will continue to hold accountable anyone who seeks to impede lawful federal operations.""

""All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation or threats,"" Andrew S. Boutros, United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, added in a statement Wednesday.

""As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder or impede the due administration of Justice.""

Abughazaleh responded to the charges in a post on X Wednesday, claiming she is being targeted for exercising her First Amendment rights.

""This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges.""

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who is also presiding over a separate case involving President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. Perry had previously blocked the deployment of troops, saying there was no evidence of a ""danger of rebellion"" in the state after the Trump administration had requested an emergency stay.

Reports, photos and videos from several community members show that federal agents were active in multiple locations on Oct. 29 afternoon in Wilmette.

Wilmette Village Manager Michael Braiman, speaking for the Village, said the resident accounts of federal law enforcement activity Wednesday are credible; though, local police did not witness any such activity.

Braiman added that police took calls on Wednesday describing multiple incidents involving federal agents in Wilmette. He could not immediately confirm, though, if agents apprehended any individuals.

Resident Chad Boomgaarden told The Record that he spoke with at least one border patrol agent around 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday in an alley between Park and Prairie avenues near his home. Boomgaarden, who shared photos supporting the encounter, said he inquired about federal jurisdiction on and near private property, among other topics.

He was walking his dog and was not pleased to see men in “face masks, camo, tactical gear and long rifle weapons” just feet from his backyard.

“You know, I’m a pretty chill dad/husband/person,” he wrote to The Record via text message, “but I’ve always had a soft spot and protective instinct for people or animals being bullied … so I have to say I was really pissed off.”

Boomgaarden did not see the agents make any arrests; however, Patrick Hanley, a Winnetka resident and local politician, who followed the agents’ vehicles into the alley reportedly witnessed up to seven armed and masked agents in fatigues detain and drive away with two individuals.

Hanley shared a video taken Wednesday with The Record that shows two vehicles in an alley and at least six uniformed and masked members of law enforcement.

“With no disrespect to sharks, it was like seeing sharks in open water. You know these people are dangerous and don’t know what they are going to do,” said Hanley, the leader of the New Trier Democrats and candidate for Illinois senate.

Hanley and dozens of community members use a group chat to track the local presence and activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officials.

Erinn Martin, of Winnetka, is also in that group chat and said when she saw messages saying ICE agents were in Wilmette, she parked her car near the Wilmette library.

When she saw a possible federal vehicle — as described in the group chat — pass by, she and a handful of other cars driven by community members in that same group chat followed it.

The car stopped at one point and agents got out, she said.

“They open the door and are standing there in tactical gear, like it’s Afghanistan, here in Wilmette,” said Martin, who grew up in Wilmette. “… They are bringing unnecessary trauma and chaos into our neighborhoods.”

Martin said she began blowing a whistle, a growing resistance measure to alert communities of federal agents in the area. She was not alone.

Boomgaarden said six people came to the alley within 30 seconds and were blowing whistles and documenting the agents via photo and video.

Martin and others continued following the alleged federal vehicles out of Wilmette, through Glenview and to the Home Depot in Niles.

Martin said the group chat has a segment they call a rapid response team, of which she is a part, and the team’s goal is to respond to the scene of an ICE sighting and warn community members while also letting the agents know they are unwanted.

“Because this is wrong,” she said. “You can have a conversation about whether immigrants need to be deported, but that’s not what this is about. If you’ve seen footage of them arresting U.S. citizens, breaking windows — there is no responsibility. Nothing is going to stop them except for us. So we have to stop them.”

She added, “There is fear in the air, and everybody should stand up. Nobody should feel that way.”

Wednesday’s incidents come on the heels of an emotional discussion during Wilmette’s Village Board meeting on Tuesday night, Oct. 28, when a large contingent of residents packed board chambers urging Village officials to respond to local ICE activity.

To address the topic, the Village Board directed staffers to prepare possible policy changes the board could approve to “help keep community members safe,” according to a community email sent by the Village on Wednesday.

The board also wants staff to prepare communication material to educate residents and better promote resources available to immigrants in the community.

Ten people were arrested. Charges include civil disorder against law enforcement officers.

AIR7 captured one person who allegedly fired a gun toward federal agents during the Camarillo confrontation. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to a conviction.

""And while the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and the freedom to peacefully assemble, it does not provide for a right to assault federal officers,"" said Eddy Wang, Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles special agent in charge.

The announcement comes as a U.S. district judge ruled that Essayli has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration's effort to extend handpicked acting U.S. attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law.

On the morning of Saturday Oct. 4, Portlanders were awaiting Immergut’s ruling on whether to issue an emergency block on the deployment of Oregon National Guard members to the city.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the federalized guard members were in motion, preparing for the mission. Some were converging on local military bases. And around 11:30 a.m. Oct. 4, according to a military document turned up in subsequent litigation, and reviewed by WW, a small advance group of 9 soldiers had arrived in the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement facility itself.

By around noon that day, the document says, those troops “assumed their first support mission.”

A few hours later, at 3:40 pm, Immergut would issue a temporary restraining order blocking that mission.

But the troops, a military document indicates, remained at the until early Oct. 5—more than 8 hours after the restraining order was issued.

A government lawyer admitted as much to Immergut Wednesday morning, as a trial got under way to help the judge determine whether to issue a more durable block on the deployment.

The government lawyer explained to the judge that it took time for the feds to issue the information about the temporary restraining order to the people on the ground.

Whether the lingering presence of the troops constituted contempt of court or was in direct violation of her temporary restraining order, Immergut responded, would be discussed later: She had a trial to proceed with.

After opening statements, lawyers for the city and the feds jumped into opening statements.

“This case is about a simple proposition, as this court well knows,” said Caroline Turco for the city of Portland. “This is a nation of constitutional law.” She added that her team was confident that at the end of this case, “the court will find that the city does not need the National Guard and the federal government does not need the National Guard.”

Eric Hamilton offered the rejoinder for the Trump administration. “For months, agitators have used violence and threatened violence against the men and women who serve their country by working for the departments of Homeland Security here in Oregon,” he said. Under the relevant federal law, the president can federalize the national guard under certain conditions, including when he could not executive the laws or there was a danger of rebellion.

Hamilton says both of these things were true. And yet, he added, it is not for the court to determine whether these things were “actually” true; Congress, he argued, left such a judgement to the president.

Instead, Hamilton said, it is for the court to decide whether the president has made a plausible “assessment of the facts and law within a range of honest judgment.”

If the testimony from local law enforcement officers that formed the bulk of the first day at trial was meant to provide the factual basis on which the judge could make that call, the discussion also served as a referendum on the quality of the police work that local and federal officers have been doing during the protests outside the ICE facility in South Portland.

The feds contend that local law enforcement has provided inadequate help, failing to intervene to clear protesters from their driveway, for example—claims they said bolstered the argument that the troops need to come in to do the job.

From the stand though, local law enforcement officer made a consistent case: the protests they have been observing and occasionally intervening in outside the ICE building have been relatively tame and lawful. They also contended that the federal counterparts have not infrequently escalated tensions unnecessarily, at times even deploying munitions in a manner that is disproportionate to the “crime or violence” of the assembled demonstrators.

The testimonies tracked how protests grew intense in June, and then became tamer into late September, when tensions rose again after Trump announced he would call in the troops.

But the relevant history clearly went back farther. Portland’s history of protests and riots following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 shaped the image of a city in the minds of many around the nation—including the president himself.

Franz Schoening, a Commander with Portland Police Bureau was there—he was a team commander during the protests in 2020.

From the stand Wednesday, he was asked how he would compare the protests at ICE from June until today to the downtown unrest then.

“I’d say there is no comparison,” he said. “The level of violence, criminal conduct that we saw in 2020 was markedly different.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/7VYCYEQCQJCNVN5HV4GZ7OKT6A.jpg?smart=true&auth=d71b18d03e25f8e55b0b30c6ea6fa1d7695732491e91cc41fb2ec190aabefc42&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-29 22:56:50.327682

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first late-afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz, which has resulted in more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers were appealing her decision at the same time, calling it “extraordinarily disruptive.”

“The order significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.

Judge troubled by tear gas

Lawyers for news outlets and activists whose lawsuit alleging excessive force by agents in and around Chicago prompted the judge to order the briefings from Bovino have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed the use of tear gas in a neighborhood where children gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on Chicago’s Northwest Side. Neighbors joined in the street as someone was arrested.

READ MORE: Immigration agents become increasingly aggressive in Chicago

“Halloween is on Friday,” the judge said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Related cases in many courts

Meanwhile prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses them of illegally blocking an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

READ MORE: Democratic congressional candidate Abughazaleh indicted over ICE protests in Illinois

Abughazaleh called the prosecution an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated that they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower-court ruling blocking the deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

Judge wants real-time updates

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for daily 5:45 p.m. briefings to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges and has banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from ICE, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals of enforcement actions have been one-sided.

“If we allow it to continue here, in the nation’s capital, what happens next?” WTOP has reached out to Nadeau’s office about the residents’ concerns.
Residents said D.C. police are arresting undocumented immigrants for minor infractions.
Nadeau’s committee invited the D.C. Office of Human Rights, which handles cases involving human rights violations, to attend the meeting.
“If actions by our own agencies do not comply with D.C. law and human rights, we need to know and we need to make demands of the executive to put an end to those actions,” Nadeau said.","Dozens of District residents spoke out at a public hearing before the D.C. Council on Wednesday about what they described as a continued collaboration between the city’s police department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

The neighbors told D.C. Council member Brianne Nadeau, who hosted the discussion, that what they’re seeing on city streets are human rights violations.

“I walk with my passport in hand,” said Nadia Salazar Sandi, a core organizer with Colectivo de Familias Migrantes, a human rights nonprofit in D.C. “I’m a parent and I can’t fathom being separated from my 3-year old. … My parents walk with a fear that I’ve never seen before, with passport copies in hand and a prayer that nothing will happen to anyone in our family.”

Last month marked the end of a 30-day cooperation between D.C. police and ICE agents. Mayor Muriel Bowser said then that officers would no longer be involved in immigration arrests.

But residents said it’s still happening.

“Every single day within one mile of the house where I was born and raised, 15 to 20 immigrants are snatched up by masked federal agents with no warrants and no due process,” said Tanya Golash-Boza, a professor of sociology at the University of California who studies immigration law enforcement.

“Our neighbors are being attacked. Families are living in terror. Children are losing their parents. And people are scared to leave their houses,” she said. “If we allow it to continue here, in the nation’s capital, what happens next?”

WTOP has reached out to Nadeau’s office about the residents’ concerns. Her office did not comment on the issue.

Residents said D.C. police are arresting undocumented immigrants for minor infractions. Then, minutes later, ICE agents will arrive on the scene to arrest them.

“On the way to grab my morning coffee, about a dozen masked ICE agents were staging in the firehouse parking lot on the corner of 14th and Newton Street,” said D.C. resident Dante O’Hara. “The workers … on the same corner of the firehouse are absolutely terrified. One of their workers told me that she was afraid to walk her daughter to school in fear of being kidnapped in front of her daughter.”

O’Hara called for the city to follow the lead of Chicago, which recently set up “ICE-free zones.” It bans federal immigration agents from using city property and private businesses as staging areas to scope out suspected undocumented immigrants.

Residents are also asking the city for more legal services for immigrants and more data collected during arrests to track which agencies are on the scene.

Nadeau’s committee invited the D.C. Office of Human Rights, which handles cases involving human rights violations, to attend the meeting. She said the office turned down her request to join.

“If actions by our own agencies do not comply with D.C. law and human rights, we need to know and we need to make demands of the executive to put an end to those actions,” Nadeau said.

Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., said she won’t be intimidated by the charges brought against her.","The Department of Justice has brought federal charges against Illinois House candidate Kat Abughazaleh and five other activists for protesting outside of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago.

The 11-page indictment, which was filed on October 23 and unsealed Wednesday, accuses Abughazaleh and the other protesters of using “force, intimidation and threat” as part of a conspiracy to prevent an unnamed ICE agent from “discharging his duties” and to “injure him in his person or property.”

The conspiracy, as the charging document describes it, involves allegations that the protesters “banged aggressively” on a federal agent’s car, “crowded together in the front and side of the Government Vehicle and pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement,” and “scratched the body of the Government Vehicle, including etching a message into the body of the vehicle, specifically the word ‘PIG.’”

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment,” wrote Abughazaleh, in a statement to The Intercept. “This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges.”

The indictment alleges that Abughazaleh, a former journalist and candidate in the Democratic primary for Illinois’s 9th Congressional District, put her hands on the hood of the car and “braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle.”

The disruption, according to the indictment, forced the federal agent “to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators.”

If convicted, the protesters could face up to six years in prison for the conspiracy charges and eight years in prison for the intimidation charge. Conspiracy charges are a common tool for prosecutors to use against protesters.

Abughazaleh — who went viral earlier this year after video emerged of ICE agents slamming the 26-year-old Democratic candidate to the ground at the same facility — pointed to the irony of the Trump administration accusing protesters of violence.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” she wrote.

The Broadview ICE processing center has been noted for its violent clashes between federal agents and protesters — with ICE agents deploying aggressive tactics at demonstrators — including an infamous incident where agents shot a pastor in the back of the head with a pepper ball.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order against federal agents in the Chicago area earlier this month, requiring them to wear a body camera and give at least two advanced warnings before deploying tear gas.

Abughazaleh, who is running in a crowded field to replace Rep.

In response to Trump’s emergency appeal of the lower court block, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett Wednesday referred a question to the full court on the language of the statute the president invoked in calling up to 300 members of the Illinois Guard into federal service for deployment in Chicago earlier this month.

To federalize the Illinois Guard members, Trump invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), an archaic and rarely used statute that allows the president to federalize state Guard troops when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or when the president is unable to execute laws with “regular forces.”

In addition to the Illinois Guard, Trump also attempted to send federalized members of the Texas Guard to Chicago.

Barrett asked the full court to consider whether the term “regular forces” in the statute refers to the regular forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

Barrett’s referral of the question was unexpected, as the states and cities challenging Trump’s domestic military deployments, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys defending them, generally haven’t broached whether the normal armed forces should be considered part of the “regular forces” referred to in the statute.

Parties involved in the lawsuits, including the Trump administration, have instead largely interpreted that to refer to federal law enforcement personnel executing federal law, such as the FBI or Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The question appears to stem from an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court by Martin Lederman, a former DOJ deputy assistant attorney general who’s now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Rather than referring to federal law enforcement, “regular forces” instead must refer to members of the formal armed forces within the Department of Defense, Lederman argued in the brief.

Lederman noted that throughout U.S. history, and specific legal history of 10 U.S.C. 12406, “regular” was often used as a shorthand for the Army — “the regulars” — as opposed to the state militias that evolved into today’s National Guard.

“It is highly uncommon, however, to refer to such civilian officials and employees as any kind of ‘forces’ at all; and they certainly are not ‘the regular forces’ to which [Title 10] refers,” Lederman wrote.

Because Trump never sent members of the armed forces to assist ICE in Chicago, Trump could not determine that he was unable to execute federal law with “regular forces” as required by Title 10 and therefore lacked the authority to federalize members of the Illinois Guard, Lederman asserted.

However, he stopped short of arguing that the president has the authority to execute federal law with members of the armed forces. That’s an authority regulated by several other laws — most prominently the statutes that make up the Insurrection Act, one of the president’s most expansive emergency powers.

“Amicus does not mean to suggest that this Court should opine on the scope of the President’s powers to use the military pursuant to the Insurrection Act,” Lederman wrote.

If the Supreme Court agrees with Lederman that “regular forces” refers to the U.S. military, it could upset almost all of Trump’s domestic military deployments so far. With exception to Los Angeles, Trump hasn’t sent regular military forces to any city in which he’s attempted to deploy National Guard troops.

When he sent troops to Los Angeles earlier this year, Trump simultaneously deployed hundreds of the Marines and federalized members of the California Guard.

Barrett asked Illinois and Chicago, and the DOJ, to submit written arguments in response to her question by Nov. 17, meaning the district court block to Trump’s Windy City deployment will likely remain in place over the coming weeks.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239839741-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 21:00:55.733696

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jean Lin on Wednesday admitted to Judge Karin Immergut that Oregon National Guard troops were briefly sent to Portland despite Immergut’s order blocking such a deployment.

The revelation came shortly before the opening of Oregon’s three-day trial against President Donald Trump and the federal government over Trump’s attempts to deploy troops to federal property in the city.

Before opening arguments, Immergut asked Lin whether her order had been defied. Lin told Immergut that between 11 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 4 and 2 a.m. Sunday Oct. 5, about six hours after Immergut issued the first of two temporary restraining orders blocking Guard deployment, members of the Oregon National Guard were sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland where protests were ongoing.

Lin did not share how many guard troops were sent or who ordered them.

“We’ll discuss later whether that’s contempt and a direct violation of my TRO,” Immergut told Lin.

In their lawsuit, lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland allege Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, as well as the agencies Noem and Hegseth lead, violated several laws and the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to deploy Guard troops to Portland over the objections of state and local elected leaders.

Each of these issues deals with the balance of state and federal power — particularly related to authority over policing within states — and the extent of presidential power over the U.S. military.

The state of California is also a party to the lawsuit, and lawyers for California asked Immergut that she determine in her final order that the roughly 200 California Guard that have been federalized and sent to Oregon, but blocked from deployment, be sent home. Those troops are waiting at Camp Withycombe in Happy Valley.

Trump federalized and attempted to deploy National Guard Oregon, then California, then Texas National Guard troops to protect the Portland ICE facility in late September claiming in a social media post that the city was “war ravaged” and that they were needed to protect federal property from protestors.

Second federal admission

The potential violation of Immergut’s court order is the second misstep federal lawyers have admitted to in recent days.

Late last week, the state of Oregon asked a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out a decision they made granting Trump the power to deploy Guard to Portland because they found testimony submitted by federal lawyers painting a picture of law enforcement woes at the ICE facility were inaccurate.

Federal lawyers had previously told the 9th Circuit judges that a “surge” of 115 Federal Protective Service officers were sent to work 24/7 since June to protect the Portland ICE facility from what Trump administration officials have tried to characterize as chaos and violence by protestors at the building.

But data that Oregon’s lawyers received as part of requests for evidence showed that no more than 31 federal police were present at the facility during any one-month period since June, and that during the three weeks around Trump’s orders to federalize National Guard troops, a low of 20 federal police officers were at the Portland ICE facility.

The charges are contained in an 11-page federal indictment made public Wednesday accusing the group of conspiring to “interrupt, hinder, and impede” the agent from the “discharge of his official duties” on the morning of Sept. 26. The confrontation marked the height of protests outside the ICE processing facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview in the weeks after the Trump administration launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” a still-ongoing immigration enforcement campaign that has so far resulted in the arrests of more than 3,000 people.

Others charged include Cook County Board candidate Catherine “Cat” Sharp, 45th Ward Democratic Committeeman Michael Rabbitt, and Oak Park Village Board Trustee Brian Straw, all Democrats. They are set for arraignment next week.

During the episode, Abughazaleh and the other defendants — along with roughly two dozen others — surrounded a government vehicle the agent was attempting to drive inside the ICE facility’s perimeter and “banged aggressively” on its hood and windows. The vehicle’s side mirror and windshield wiper were broken during the confrontation, and the word “PIG” was etched into its side, according to the indictment.

Video of the incident, posted to the social media accounts Abughazaleh developed as a progressive activist and conservative media critic before launching her congressional campaign, shows the candidate in front of the vehicle as the agent drove slowly through the crowd.

In addition to the felony conspiracy charge, Abughazaleh and her co-defendants are each charged with misdemeanor simple assault of a federal officer, which does not require physical contact.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who has blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago, which the White House claims is necessary due to “violent” protests. But Perry said the feds’ narrative of the protests has been “unreliable.”

Responding to the unsealed indictment Wednesday, Abughazaleh called it “a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent” by “weaponizing the federal justice system.”

“As I and others have exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and tear gassed hundreds protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” she said in a video posted to social media.

A federal judge earlier this month issued a temporary restraining order restricting agents’ use of riot control weapons like tear gas after protesters, journalists and clergy filed a lawsuit over the deployment of tear gas, pepper balls and other crowd-control tactics outside the Broadview facility.

But even as protests outside the ICE facility have calmed, clashes between U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents and civilians in Chicago neighborhoods have resulted in multiple deployments of tear gas in the last week. To account for the alleged violations of her order, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis summoned Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino into her courtroom Tuesday and ordered him to report for daily check-ins for the next week. But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday stayed the order requiring Bovino to appear daily.

Abughazaleh isn’t the only congressional candidate who’s had a run-in with immigration agents since Operation Midway Blitz began. Earlier this month, state Rep. Hoan Huynh, D-Chicago, who is also running for the 9th District, said a Border Patrol agent pointed a gun at him while he warned residents of Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood of immigration enforcement activity nearby. Yet another 9th District candidate, Evanston Mayor Dan Biss, was tear gassed while protesting in Broadview last month. In a statement Wednesday, Biss called the charges against his opponent “frivolous” and said they should be “dropped immediately.”

Straw, the charged Oak Park trustee, said the Trump administration made a “decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies.” Through his attorney, he said he would “fight these baseless charges.”

State Rep. Lisa Hernandez, chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois, said the indictment was representative of “a hypocritical, tear-gas-loving Administration run on violence, political punishment and suffocating the First Amendment.”

“In this country, protesters are allowed to tell their government, ‘No, we will not stand by and just watch while you disappear our neighbors,'” she said.

“This political prosecution is an attack on all of our First Amendment rights,” Abughazaleh, a progressive influencer and journalist, said in the post. “I’m not backing down, and we’re going to win.”

Currently, Abughazelah is running for an open seat representing Illinois’s ninth congressional district, to the north of Chicago. She is slated to appear on the Democratic primary ballot in March.

Federal prosecutors, however, have accused her and her co-defendants of having “physically hindered and impeded” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at a detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

The indictment said they surrounded a government vehicle, “banged aggressively”, stopped the agent from driving forward, and etched “PIG” on the body of the vehicle. It further alleged that the group broke the vehicle’s side mirrors and a windshield wiper.

Abughazaleh was charged with “conspiracy to impede or injure an officer” and “assaulting, resisting or impeding” a federal agent for the September 23 incident.

Those charged alongside Abughazelah include Michael Rabbitt, a Democratic politician in Chicago’s 45th Ward, and Catherine Sharp, a Democrat running for a seat on the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

The charges come as the administration of President Donald Trump surges federal agents to Democrat-run cities as part of a large-scale deportation drive.

Several Democratic lawmakers have been charged after participating in counterprotests, including Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and US Representative LaMonica McIver. Baraka has since seen the charges against him dropped.

Trump has also sought to deploy the National Guard to several cities, including Chicago, but has been repeatedly blocked by the courts. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the Chicago case, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of such deployments.

A federal appeals court was also set to hear a Trump administration challenge on Wednesday to a lower court’s ruling barring the National Guard deployment to Portland, Oregon.

As part of those cases, the Trump administration has faced scrutiny over its treatment of immigrants and protesters alike.

The administration has also been criticised for comparing protesters to “terrorists” and pursuing disproportionate charges in court.

Even Abughazelah’s opponent in the 2026 Democratic primary, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, was among those condemning Wednesday’s indictment.

“The only people engaged in violent and dangerous behavior at Broadview have been ICE,” Biss said in a statement carried by the local news site Evanston Now.

Biss noted he had also protested the “kidnapping of our neighbours” at the facility multiple times.

“Now, the Trump Administration is targeting protestors, including political candidates, in an effort to silence dissent and scare residents into submission,” Biss said. “It won’t work.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_690277c13c3e-1761769409.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-29 19:02:03.900332

Ellis' order for Bovino to appear in person came after she questioned the Border Patrol Chief for more than an hour Tuesday.
Attorneys representing the Trump administration asked Ellis to stay her requests in open court on Tuesday.
The appeals court has also asked that attorneys representing the protesters, clergy and journalists to weigh in by 5 p.m. Thursday.
In an interview with the Telemundo network last Thursday, Bovino said this when asked about Ellis' order:""Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head with a rock like i did this morning?","In a late afternoon call-and-response, a federal appeals court has placed a temporary pause on a federal judge's order that required Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino to appear in court every day before her.

This afternoon, attorneys representing the Trump administration appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay on federal judge Sara Ellis' Tuesday order which - in part - required Bovino to show up in federal court every day at 5:45 p.m. to discuss use-of-force related encounters with protesters or bystanders who object to the increased immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and surrounding suburbs.

Ellis' order for Bovino to appear in person came after she questioned the Border Patrol Chief for more than an hour Tuesday.

Ellis had previously issued a temporary restraining order back on October 9 barring federal immigration agents from using crowd control agents like tear gas or pepper spray on protesters unless there is a threat.

Her TRO came in response to a lawsuit brought by a group of protesters, clergy and journalists who sued the Trump administration alleging that the use of chemical irritants on them have been unnecessary and violated their constitutional rights to gather.

On Tuesday, Ellis ordered that Bovino appear in person after raising concerns about a number of incidents in which protesters, bystanders or their attorneys have alleged that they were tear gassed unnecessarily - and in violation of Ellis' TRO.

The judge has also asked for all use of force reports since ""Operation Midway Blitz"" began in early September and the accompanying body camera footage by the end of business Friday. Bovino will be required to wear a body camera as well.

Attorneys representing the Trump administration asked Ellis to stay her requests in open court on Tuesday.

She denied their requests.

In their appeal to the Seventh Circuit on Wednesday afternoon, attorneys representing the Trump administration wrote that Ellis' order:

...significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis. The court’s order is also untethered to the plaintiffs’ underlying claims and goes substantially beyond what is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the court’s prior orders.""

And later that:

""... Absent a stay, the government will be irreparably harmed because Chief Bovino will be required to prepare and sit for questioning in open court today and every weekday thereafter, with no stated endpoint in sight. Every occasion that Chief Bovino is required to prepare and appear for those daily court sessions is time that he would otherwise spend carrying out the important law-enforcement functions he has been assigned...""

In their ruling late Wednesday afternoon, the appeals court temporarily stayed Ellis' order that Bovino have to appear daily in court - for now - writing:

""IT IS ORDERED that the government’s request for an administrative stay is GRANTED. Pending a decision on the petition for a writ of mandamus, the district court’s October 28, 2025 order is temporarily STAYED only to the extent it required Gregory Bovino to appear in court, in person, each weekday at 5:45 PM.""

The appeals court has also asked that attorneys representing the protesters, clergy and journalists to weigh in by 5 p.m. Thursday.

NBC 5 Chicago has reached out to Department of Justice attorneys asking for clarity on Wednesday's ruling.

It comes as a deposition for Bovino is set for Thursday - ahead of a preliminary junction hearing set for November 5th where attorneys representing the protesters are trying to prohibit further use of chemical agents.

Top deputy officials with Border Patrol and ICE testified last week that the use of chemical agents in at least two cases were justified because protesters either blocked the path of agents trying to leave during an immigration arrest or threw objects at agents.

Bovino himself has been accused by the plaintiffs' attorneys of violating Ellis' temporary restraining order by using tear gas on a crowd that gathered last Thursday in Little Village where agents were conducting more arrests.

Bovino and the Department of Homeland Security said the use of tear gas was necessary because Bovino had been hit in the head by an object. Bovino said it was a rock.

In an interview with the Telemundo network last Thursday, Bovino said this when asked about Ellis' order:""Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head with a rock like i did this morning? I had to apply gas this morning against people. Was she hit in the head with a rock? Maybe she needs to see what that's like before issuing an order like that,"" Bovino said.

Some Illinois Democrats accused the Justice Department of singling out President Trump’s political opponents for prosecution with the indictment, which was unsealed on Wednesday. The top federal prosecutor in Chicago defended the charges as upholding the rule of law.

For nearly two months, federal agents have flooded the Chicago area as part of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration, making more than 3,000 arrests and clashing repeatedly with protesters and residents.

The charges unsealed on Wednesday related to a Sept. 26 protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill. Demonstrators have gathered repeatedly at the Broadview site, sometimes blocking access to the driveway and engaging in physical confrontations with federal agents. Those agents have at times used tear gas, pepper balls and physical force against protesters.

The charging document asserts that the defendants were part of a larger group that tried to block a federal agent from driving to the ICE facility that morning. The indictment said members of the group banged on the vehicle, stood in front of it, pushed against it and damaged a side mirror and a windshield wiper. Someone in the group etched the word “PIG” into the vehicle, the charging document said.

All six defendants were charged with interfering with a federal agent and conspiring with one another to interfere with an agent. Both charges can carry multiyear prison sentences.

“All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation or threats,” said Andrew S. Boutros, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, in a statement. “As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder or impede the due administration of Justice.”

Those indicted included Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic candidate for Congress; Brian Straw, an Oak Park, Ill., village trustee; and Cat Sharp, a candidate for the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Ms. Abughazaleh, who is running for an open seat in Illinois’s solidly Democratic Ninth Congressional District, said in a video posted online that “this is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent.” That seat, which includes part of the North Side of Chicago and several suburbs, is now held by Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat who is not seeking another term.

Ms. Sharp said in a statement that “I am confident that a jury of my peers will see these charges for exactly what they are — another effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Mr. Straw said in a statement that “the Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office.” He added that “I will fight these baseless charges, and I will continue to stand with and protect our immigrant neighbors.”

The unsealing of the indictment in Illinois came on the same day that federal prosecutors in California announced the arrests of 10 people accused of breaking the law during protests of immigration enforcement in that state. The officials said that an 11th defendant was in state custody and was expected to be transferred to the federal authorities, while they declared a 12th person a fugitive.

Nine of the defendants in California were accused of obstructing, impeding and interfering with law enforcement during a large demonstration in downtown Los Angeles on June 8. The protest, which grew chaotic at times, occurred the day after President Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to Southern California.

In Illinois, the tactics of federal officers have come under repeated scrutiny in recent weeks as agents have been filmed using tear gas on protesters and bystanders while making arrests. Federal officials have said force has been used appropriately after agents have come under direct threats. A federal judge, Sara L. Ellis, placed restrictions on agents’ actions after a lawsuit accused them of indiscriminately deploying tear gas and using force.

During a hearing this week, Judge Ellis, an Obama appointee, voiced concern that agents had not always followed her restrictions. She ordered a senior Border Patrol official, Gregory Bovino, to appear in her courtroom each weeknight to discuss that day’s enforcement activities. Mr. Bovino had been expected to make his first such trip to court on Wednesday evening, but a federal appellate court temporarily blocked that requirement shortly before the hearing was set to begin.

The court intervened on Wednesday before Greg Bovino’s first late afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis.

Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents in the city. The operation has produced more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Ellis's order followed enforcement actions in which tear gas was used, including in a neighborhood where children had gathered for a Halloween parade on the city's Northwest Side. Neighbors had joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” she said. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News, Bovino defended federal agents' actions and said he was eager to talk with the judge.

Among those who face charges related to impeding federal law enforcement is Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate indicted along with five other people over allegations they blocked a federal immigration enforcement building in the Chicago suburbs. The indictment was unsealed Wednesday.

Abughazaleh said in a social media post that the prosecution was an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

The administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration's emergency appeal to overturn a lower court ruling that has blocked the troop deployments.

A federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment in Portland, Oregon, got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for a daily 5:45 p.m. briefing to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing in a lawsuit from news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force during demonstrations.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

Such foreign nationals will need a formal approval of their renewal application and receipt of a new physical EAD.

Under the automatic extension practice, foreign nationals who had timely filed an application to renew their EAD in certain categories would receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization validity anywhere between 180 days through 540 days from the expiration date of their current EAD, while their renewal application are pending.

DHS states that ending this practice will better allow the “proper screening and vetting” of foreign nationals, as well as fraud detection.

Under the new interim final rule, as of Oct. 30, 2025, foreign nationals who file to renew their EAD will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization. Rather, they would need to wait for a formal approval of their renewal application and receipt of a new physical EAD to extend their employment authorization.

DHS has identified limited exceptions to the interim final rule, including extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for Temporary Protected Status-related employment documentation. Further, DHS has confirmed that the interim final rule does not affect EADs automatically extended prior to Oct. 30, 2025.

In light of these changes, USCIS advises that foreign nationals should apply to renew their EADs as soon as possible, up to 180 days before their current EAD expires. Foreign nationals who may be eligible to renew their EADs under premium processing, may wish to do so. These actions can help minimize any potential lapse in their employment authorization.

However, due to the unpredictable fluctuations in EAD processing times and the limited availability of premium processing or expedited review in most employment authorization categories, temporary lapses in employment authorization may occur, even for foreign nationals who file an EAD renewal application at the earliest possible instance.

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first late-afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz, which has resulted in more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers were appealing her decision at the same time, calling it “extraordinarily disruptive.”

“The order significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.

“We are thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Attorneys still met with Ellis in the evening to discuss logistics in the evidence-gathering phase of the case. They agreed to a 9 p.m. deadline to submit body camera recordings of federal agents using tear gas on people in the predominantly Mexican American neighborhood of Little Village last week.

Judge troubled by tear gas

Lawyers for news outlets and activists whose lawsuit alleging excessive force by agents in and around Chicago prompted the judge to order the briefings from Bovino have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed the use of tear gas in a neighborhood where children gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on Chicago’s Northwest Side. Neighbors joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” the judge said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Related cases in many courts

Meanwhile prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses them of illegally blocking an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

Abughazaleh called the prosecution an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated that they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower-court ruling blocking the deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

Judge wants real-time updates

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for daily 5:45 p.m. briefings to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges and has banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.","Border Patrol agents have carried out more arrests in the Chicago area than their counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, illustrating the expanded role they are playing far away from U.S. borders under the Trump administration, internal federal government data obtained by CBS News indicates.

This week, arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the Chicago-area ""Midway Blitz"" operation surpassed those recorded by ICE, the agency that is, on paper, responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country.

Since Sept. 16, agents at CBP have recorded roughly 1,500 arrests in the Chicago region, compared to over 1,400 arrests carried out by ICE officers, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security figures. In mid-October, ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago operation was higher, totaling around 1,000, compared to roughly 800 arrests recorded by CBP at the time.

The government figures underscore the unprecedented way the second Trump administration has used Border Patrol agents, whose work has been historically limited to intercepting the illicit movement of people and drugs along the borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as some coastal sectors.

As part of its nationwide mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has dispatched teams of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents across the country, instructing them to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants in major Democratic-led cities.

That effort has been spearheaded by Gregory Bovino, an outspoken Border Patrol sector chief who has personally led arrest operations, first in Los Angeles and Sacramento over the summer, and most recently in Chicago. He has gained infamy among critics who denounce his agents' tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, as well as support among those who view him as an effective, no-nonsense enforcer of President Trump's aggressive clampdown on illegal immigration.

Over the summer, sweeping ""roving patrols"" by Border Patrol agents in the Los Angeles area targeted day laborers at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes, triggering widespread local backlash, including accusations of racial profiling that federal officials have strongly denied.

Nearly identical scenes have played out in the Chicago area in recent weeks, where the Border Patrol teams led by Bovino have conducted similarly aggressive operations, prompting protests and confrontations with local residents and activists. Videos posted on social media have depicted cases of Border Patrol agents chasing individuals in densely populated areas or being confronted by angry residents. Bovino has joined agents on some of those Chicago-area operations, as well as outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, where protesters have gathered for weeks.

On Tuesday, Bovino was summoned before a federal judge in Chicago who has ordered his agents to limit their use of force against protesters and to generally give them two warnings before deploying chemical agents. The judge told Bovino to ensure his agents comply with the order, citing several cases of them deploying tear gas, including one incident she said affected children getting ready for a Halloween parade.

Federal officials have said they've deployed tear gas in volatile situations and to protect agents. In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Bovino said, ""the use of force that I've seen has been exemplary — the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission.""

Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support for Mr. Trump's mass deportation pledge, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.

Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, routine ICE operations are typically targeted in nature, informed by previous intelligence gathering and surveillance and aimed at arresting people in the country unlawfully who also have criminal records. ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.

But in a sign that top Trump administration officials think Border Patrol's aggressive style can help boost deportation levels, CBS News reported earlier this week that officials made plans to reassign roughly half of ICE's 25 field office directors and, in many cases, replace them with CBP officials.

DHS, which oversees both ICE and CBP, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday the department ""is one team and we have one fight, to secure the homeland.""

""DHS has arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members, as part of DHS's Operation Midway Blitz,"" the department added.

The vast majority of CBP personnel deployed to Chicago are Border Patrol agents, though some officers from its Office of Field Operations branch are also there. As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents, like ICE officers, have the authority to stop people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country, though they have heightened search and seizure powers near border areas.

Matt Hudak, who started at the Border Patrol in the late 1990s until retiring as deputy chief in 2023, said the way the Trump administration has deployed Border Patrol agents to U.S. cities is ""unique,"" though he emphasized their nationwide immigration authorities.

Hudak said the administration is increasingly turning to Border Patrol for interior immigration enforcement because the agency has roughly 20,000 agents — significantly more than ICE's team of fewer than 6,000 deportation officers. Border Patrol is also no longer facing a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where government figures show illegal crossings have plummeted to a 55-year low after soaring to record highs under the Biden administration.

But Hudak said Border Patrol agents can also operate in a ""faster-paced"" and more ""forward-leaning"" way compared to ICE officers, whose approach to arrests is ""methodical"" and slower. That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.

""It's just like a baseball game, right?"" Hudak said. ""If you're not getting the scoring, the game's not going the way you want, you look at another head coach, or you change pitchers during the game to get that different result.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/29/04af6a81-60bf-4832-89c0-3028d375f127/thumbnail/1200x630/ed57edd01f68d208127a77669b7eac84/gettyimages-2243444780.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 21:00:46.002942

“That is the fundamental challenge,” said a person close to the Trump administration, also granted anonymity to speak candidly.
But there is significant friction among the Trump administration’s top immigration officials.
“Border Patrol, as a general matter, is more equipped and better skilled at playing the political game,” said the administration official.","“Border Patrol just wants to go out and arrest every person in the world, and it’s easy for them to do that because they go out and arrest them and they turn them over to ICE,” said an administration official, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “You’re giving ICE all of these cases that aren’t ready to be removed. And that creates a challenge for ICE.”

The dynamic highlights a tension at the center of the president’s second term immigration agenda. Trump officials are eager to ramp up arrests and removals, but continually run up against resource and operational challenges amid an overloaded deportation system.

The Trump administration has seen historic lows for illegal border crossings, and roughly 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE detention, a major increase since the president took office. The number of daily arrests peaked at more than 2,000 but typically hover around 1,000 — far less than the 3,000-a-day target floated earlier this year by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. But even Trump allies continue to question the administration’s deportation figures — citing limited data transparency — and say removals can’t keep up with the pace of arrests, a problem that’s bound to expand.

“That is the fundamental challenge,” said a person close to the Trump administration, also granted anonymity to speak candidly. “The real backlog is with the removal process.”

The GOP megabill, signed by Trump in July, provided DHS with billions of dollars in fresh funding to bolster ICE’s ranks and expand detention capacity, but the build-out process has been slow and ICE has struggled with its hiring. The money has helped, but it hasn’t yet been able to square the mismatch between the White House’s large appetite for better numbers and ICE’s expanding but still limited capabilities.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration’s progress and said the president’s “entire team is working in lockstep to implement the president’s policy agenda.”

“The tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves,” she said.

But there is significant friction among the Trump administration’s top immigration officials. Even as they share the same goal, they differ on the best way to accomplish the president’s promises to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, said the administration official and others close to the administration.

Border czar Tom Homan and acting ICE director Todd Lyons, two career immigration enforcement officials, are more cognizant of the agency’s limitations as it expands and are focused on apprehending criminals and immigrants who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and can be deported quickly, said an administration official and the two people close to the administration.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski, a chief adviser to Noem and a special governmental employee, want to ramp up numbers and are eager to use aggressive tactics to arrest all unauthorized immigrants, the people said.

“It seems to me that [Lewandowski’s] thinking in political terms, whereas, Tom and Todd, I know they’re thinking in operational terms — the operational benefits to doing this, and public safety benefits and safety of ICE officers,” said the person close to the administration. “They didn’t get where they are without understanding the political aspect of it, but that’s not their primary concern.”

DHS did not specifically respond to the notion that there are differing opinions inside the administration, but DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, responding to reports of internal tensions, said it’s “one team, one fight,” led by Noem. In a separate statement to POLITICO, she said the administration is working at “turbospeed on cost-effective and innovative ways” to deliver on mass deportations, citing the megabill that provided DHS funding to hire more ICE officers and expand detention capacity.

“The Trump Administration is on pace to shatter historic records and deport nearly 600,000 illegal aliens by the end of President Donald Trump’s first year since returning to office,” she said. “More than 2 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. including 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and over 527,000 deportations.”

The administration’s latest shift is connected to Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led a series of aggressive raids across Chicago and its suburbs, said the official and one of the people close to the administration. Noem and her inner circle are impressed with Bovino’s approach. He has emerged as the key face of the Trump administration’s immigration blitz in sanctuary cities and was ordered by a federal judge this week to report to her daily after reports of combative enforcement in Chicago, including the use of tear gas.

“Border Patrol, as a general matter, is more equipped and better skilled at playing the political game,” said the administration official. “This very much shows how Border Patrol can get in front of DHS leadership and get them to do things that benefit the Border Patrol.”

The efforts build on the Trump administration’s expanded use of CBP agents and Border Patrol officers, as well as law enforcement officials from across the federal government to support ICE’s operations in recent months. Border Patrol, in particular, is a more aggressive agency, and its expanded role will help the administration stoke fear in its targeting of blue cities, said Deborah Fleischaker, who served as ICE chief of staff under the Biden administration.

“Border Patrol and ICE have different missions, and this appears to be part of the effort of trying to import the Border Patrol mission, which is much more militarized, much less constrained and a little more Wild West, and bring that into an agency that historically has been very focused on identifying and enforcing against specific targets,” she said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F48%2Ff4%2Fafca33bb486984a92381bf1e7af5%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2235818079,N,,2025-10-29 17:57:21.626713

Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela told commissioners during a 10-minute meeting Wednesday in Estancia that the ongoing government shutdown might be behind the delay, and said it’s unclear what will happen if the county does not receive a contract extension by Saturday.

Torrance County’s facility is one of three New Mexico detention centers housing hundreds of detainees for ICE, and its commission has faced renewed calls to cancel the agreement amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push.

According to the latest estimates from DetentionReports.com, which collects and analyzes ICE data, Torrance currently has an average daily population of about 551 ICE detainees, an increase of about 150 detainees since Trump’s second term began.

Immigrant advocates: NM ICE detention ban should have been on special session agenda

In recent years, Torrance County and ICE have renewed the contract with repeated months-long contract extensions, most recently with a six-month extension enacted in April that expires Friday.

While ICE has not yet provided a new contract, “There have been some discussions back and forth,” Barela told commissioners Wednesday. “It’s my understanding that they are currently working on a 30-day contract amendment. I don’t know to what degree that the government shutdown has any implications with that.”

The commission approved delegating authority to Barela to approve an extension if he receives an amended contract from ICE in the next two days.

If ICE takes until Nov. 1 or later to provide an amended contract, Barela will have to take the matter back to the commission. In the meantime, “I imagine if there’s a lapse in the contract term, that revenue would not be coming into the county and could not be distributed to Core Civic [which operates the jail] for providing the services,” he said.

The brief meeting did not allow for public comment, though about a dozen members of immigration advocacy groups tuned in to the livestream, including some whose profile pictures were quotes from current or former Torrance County ICE detainees alleging mistreatment.

NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The groups have cited poor conditions at Torrance, including whistleblower accounts from former jail staff and violations from the Office of the Inspector General. They are calling on the commission to cease its contract, and also on state lawmakers to pass legislation that would ban local governments from contracting with ICE.

Commissioners have pointed to the jobs that could be lost in the rural county without the funding from ICE to house detainees. Barela recently testified before a local Civil Rights commission that the detention center employs approximately 93 Torrance County residents, paying them “millions of dollars a year” in salaries and benefits in an “economically depressed area with few substitute sectors of the economy.”

Shortly before Wednesday’s vote, Torrance County Commissioner Linda Jaramillo asked Barela whether detainees would still receive services if the contract lapses.

“I have had discussions with the facility,” he said. “I can’t definitively speak for them, though they do think that for at least a period of time, the services will continue.”

Barela’s answer did not satisfy Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, one of the groups seeking to cancel the contract. He maintains ICE detainees don’t receive the services they need now, even while the contract is in effect.

“We appreciate her concern about people still getting the services,” he said. “But we would also like to remind the commissioner and the public of the ongoing failures of service provision, both from a due process and a human rights standpoint that occur every single day.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-29-at-9.02.58-AM-2048x1104.png,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:25.328600

The indictment, filed last week, alleges that the 26-year old Palestinian American candidate and five other individuals “physically hindered and impeded” a federal agent who was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators”.

Abughazaleh, who is running for Illinois’s ninth congressional district to replace the outgoing Democrat Jan Schakowsky, was charged with conspiracy to forcibly impede or injure a federal agent, and assaulting or impeding the agent while they were performing official duties.

According to the indictment, the group “conspired with one another and others, known and unknown, to prevent by force, intimidation, and threat, Agent A, a United States law enforcement officer, from discharging the duties of his office”.

It alleged that Abughazaleh, along with the other individuals, “banged aggressively” on the agent’s vehicle, “crowded together in the front and side” of the vehicle and “pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement”.

According to the indictment, the group etched the word “pig” on to the vehicle and broke a side mirror and a rear windshield wiper. It also alleged that Abughazaleh specifically “joined the crowd at the front of the government vehicle, and with her hands on the hood braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle, hindering and impeding” the agent.

Following the indictment, Abughazaleh, who is known for her large social media platform on which she frequently criticizes Donald Trump’s immigration crackdowns, called the indictment “political prosecution”.

“This is a … gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the first amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges,” she said.

Abughazaleh added: “As I and others exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal.

“This case targets our rights to protest, speak freely, and associate with anyone who disagrees with this government … I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism and I’m not going to give up now,” she continued.

Abughazaleh, Michael Rabbitt, Andre Martin, Catherine Sharp, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh are each being charged with conspiracy to impede or injure federal officers, according to a federal grand jury indictment that was returned under seal on Oct. 23. Some of those indicted protesters also face individual counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers as they protested outside the Broadview ICE facility last month.

Sharp is a Cook County board candidate and currently the chief of staff for Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th), and Rabbitt is a 45th Ward Democratic committeeperson. Martin is Abughazaleh’s campaign field director, and he declined to comment Wednesday.

Straw has served on the Village of Oak Park’s board of trustees in 2023 and also practices as an attorney for a Chicago-based law firm. According to his firm’s web site, Straw has done pro bono work and provided legal support for non-profit organizations with a focus on “immigration, asylum, discrimination and constitutionality issues.”

The indictment focuses on a Sept. 26 protest and accuses the six people charged of surrounding a government vehicle as it approached the Broadview building “with the intent to hinder and impede” an agent from proceeding. According to the indictment, those six, and others, “banged aggressively” on the vehicle, crowded together and pushed against the vehicle.

Someone scratched the word “PIG” on the vehicle and broke a side mirror and windshield wiper, the indictment said. Abughezaleh and others are accused of putting their hands on the hood of the vehicle and remaining “directly” in its path.

“All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation, or threats,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros said in a statement Wednesday. “As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder, or impede the due administration of Justice. The rule of law must always be upheld.”

In a post on social media, Abughazaleh on Wednesday described the case as “yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up.”

“That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges, but I need your help to do it,” Abughazaleh wrote to her followers alongside a fundraising plea. “We cannot diminish ourselves in the face of these tactics; it’s time to unite and show up for humanity, for our rights, for everyone terrorized by Trump’s lawless secret police.”

Abughazaleh has been a regular presence at protests outside the Broadview processing facility, sharing videos on social media of federal agents throwing her to the ground at one point last month.

‘The Charges … Are Ludicrous’

The charges were viewed as an attempt at stiffing protest and dissent against Trump’s government, said some of those facing charges.

“The charges brought against Ms. Sharp are ludicrous,” Molly Armour, attorney for Sharp, said in a statement. “We are confident that a jury of Ms. Sharp’s peers will see them for exactly what they are: an effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Vasquez, who has worked with Sharp for years, said the charges won’t have the effect the Trump administration intends for them to have.

“They want to scare us into submission. It won’t work,” Vasquez said. “With these charges, they’re acting with the same lack of regard for the constitution that we’ve seen from them every day on the streets of Chicago. All we need to say is ‘see you in court.'”

In a statement Wednesday, Straw said he joined the protests at Broadview “because of what is happening to our immigrant neighbors: children zip-tied and shoved into vans, mothers pulled from cars on the way to school, neighbors afraid to go to church or work.”

“The Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office,” Straw said. “I will fight these baseless charges, and I will continue to stand with and protect our immigrant neighbors.”

Brad Thomson, an attorney representing Walsh, called the indictment “an egregious attack on First Amendment protected activity” and said that Walsh would be “pleading not guilty to these outrageous charges.”

The Protest At The Heart Of The Indictments

A Sept. 26 social media post by Abughazaleh depicts what appears to be the encounter at the center of the conspiracy indictment.

“At the Broadview ICE facility, an ICE agent tried to run dozens of protesters over with an SUV as we walked on a public crosswalk,” Abughazaleh wrote in the post, which published just before 8 a.m. that day. “He kept driving for about a full football field until ICE barraged us with pepper balls.”

In the 21-second clip, Abughazaleh and about a half dozen others are at the front of a group of protesters crowding around the government vehicle. The crowd chants, “up up with liberation, down down with deportation” as the vehicle slowly pushes forward while Abughazaleh and others hold on to its hood and each other. Multiple people can be seen banging on the vehicle’s hood while others toss stuffed animals at it as the video ends.

The Sept. 26 protest at the heart of the indictment featured hours of conflict between federal agents and demonstrators. Agents deployed rubber bullets, pepper spray balls and pepper spray against protesters — at one point doing so for an hour and a half as outraged protesters crowded in a narrow parking lot adjacent to the facility. The riot-control weapons hit organizers, journalists and photographers who were also at the scene and, at one point, a sniper on the building’s roof fired projectiles that shattered the windows of a nearby business.

Organizers were forced to move locations during that day’s protest because federal officials had erected a fence in the street near the processing center. Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered the removal of that fence after the Village of Broadview filed a lawsuit that said it was put up illegally.

The Justice Department has now charged two dozen people with either assaulting or impeding federal immigration officers in the past month, coinciding with its Operation Midway Blitz effort aimed at enforcing federal immigration laws, according to records reviewed by Block Club.

Five cases were quickly dismissed by prosecutors, including one in which a grand jury refused to return an indictment.

When U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard in Illinois, she pointed to some of those dismissals when questioning the Department of Homeland Security’s “credibility and assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago.”

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She's running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

""I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,"" she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a social media influencer and former journalist running for Congress in Illinois’s 9th District, was hit with two counts: conspiracy to impede or injure an ICE officer and assaulting or impeding them while they engaged in their official duties.

She’s charged alongside five others, including Michael Rabbitt, a Democratic committeeperson in Chicago’s 45th Ward, and Catherine Sharp, who is running to sit on the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Their arraignment has been scheduled for Nov. 5.

Court records show the indictment was handed up by a grand jury last week but unsealed by a federal judge on Wednesday.

The indictment says Abughazaleh and her co-defendants “surrounded” an ICE officer’s vehicle on Sept. 26 as he attempted to reach the immigration enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill., which has become the focus of protests in the area.

The group allegedly “banged aggressively” on the government vehicle and crowded together on the front and side of the car, pushing against it to impede its movement. They also etched the message “PIG” into the body of the car and broke both a mirror and a windshield wiper, prosecutors say.

“It was further part of the conspiracy that the co-conspirators … physically hindered and impeded Agent A and the Government Vehicle such that Agent A was forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators and in doing so slowly progressed towards the BSSA to discharge the duties of his office,” the indictment reads.

In a statement posted to Instagram, Abughazaleh said she was charged for exercising her First Amendment rights over ICE tactics in Chicago, while federal agents have “hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included.”

“Because Chicago doesn’t back down from bullies in masks who teargas our neighborhoods, this administration is resorting to weaponizing the federal legal system to scare us into silence,” the congressional candidate wrote. “But we are not going to be silent.”

If convicted, the conspiracy count carries a sentence of up to six years in prison, and the assault count carries up to an eight-year sentence.

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who is also overseeing the case regarding President Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago — in part to help protect the Broadview ICE facility, according to federal officials.

The others charged are Andre Martin, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh.

Abughazaleh’s lawyer, Joshua Herman, called the case a “political prosecution that tries to turn dissent and First Amendment opposition to the Trump administration’s cruel policies into a conspiracy.”

“Kat has steadfastly opposed those policies and she will fight these charges with the same principled determination,” he said.

Sharp said in a statement that she’s confident a jury of her peers will “see these charges for exactly what they are — another effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.” Her attorney, Molly Armour, called the charges “ludicrous.”

Straw, a member of the Village Board in suburban Oak Park, called the charges “baseless” and said he would fight them while continuing to stand with immigrants.

“The Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office,” he said.

Brad Thomsen, who represents Walsh, called the indictment an “egregious attack on First Amendment protected activity” and said Walsh would plead not guilty.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She's running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

""I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,"" she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

The Post reported Wednesday that an August DHS post, in which a department staffer says that federal officers were on the job “day and night to arrest, detain and deport vicious criminals from our nation’s capital,” featured multiple clips from operations months prior and outside the District of Columbia.

“What a dishonest, slanted, and fundamentally inaccurate piece from @WashingtonPost,” the DHS wrote in a post Wednesday on social platform X, featuring a screenshot of a report from the Post.

”Brutal assaults, and attacks by antifa terrorists have surged against our officers for months now, and the Washington Post has completely ignored them,” the department added.

Clips of operations, such as those used in the DHS video in question, have been used by administration officials in a minimum of six pro-President Trump immigration agenda videos put out within the last three months, according to the Post.

“Here’s the actual story, laying out detailed reporting with receipts,” Lamothe added, featuring a link to the report.

Since Trump’s return to office in January, the administration has heavily cracked down on immigration, increasing raids across the country.

Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons said New York City would experience a higher rate of immigration arrests in the wake of protesters confronting officers amid an operation.

“You will see an increase in ICE arrests because there are so many criminals and illegal aliens that have been released in New York, specifically,” Lyons said on Fox News.

Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., among other cities, have also been targeted by the administration.

“Federal law enforcement officials operating in Seattle are not above the laws of our city,” said Mayor Harrell.
A willful and knowing violation of the ordinance by a law enforcement officer or agency can result in a civil violation and penalty of $5,000.
The second order reaffirms that the City has no role in civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.
This is intended to prevent federal immigration enforcement from using parking lots and similar spaces for staging, which has occurred in other cities like Chicago.","New ordinance will also require officers to clearly display badges or emblems of agency, increasing transparency and accountability

Seattle – Today, Mayor Bruce Harrell proposed a new ordinance to prohibit the use of face coverings by law enforcement, with limited exceptions, and require all law enforcement officials to have visible emblems and badges that identify their agency while performing enforcement duties in Seattle.

This legislation puts Seattle on track to be the first city in Washington and one of the first major cities in the country to adopt a mask ban to increase transparency and accountability around federal law enforcement activity, including immigration enforcement operations.

“Federal law enforcement officials operating in Seattle are not above the laws of our city,” said Mayor Harrell. “The Trump administration’s tactic of using masked, unidentified agents to carry out their inhumane deportation agenda with impunity not only erodes accountability but also sows fear in our communities and creates a dangerous possibility for copycat actors. In the face of Trump’s tyrannical militarization of American cities, this ordinance is a concrete step we can take to uphold our local values and protect our immigrant and refugee communities from these unjust actions. My administration remains committed to using every tool at our disposal to protect the safety and dignity of our residents from federal overreach.”

Face coverings include any mask, garment, helmet, headgear, or other item that conceals or obscures the facial identity of an individual, including a balaclava, tactical mask, gator, and ski mask. The ordinance includes exemptions, including medical or surgical masks to protect against transmission of disease, and respirators to protect against toxins or other environmental hazards.

A willful and knowing violation of the ordinance by a law enforcement officer or agency can result in a civil violation and penalty of $5,000. The ordinance will be enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

“Accountability is not punishment, it is a promise kept,” said Derrick Wheeler-Smith, Director of the Seattle Office for Civil Rights. “This legislation strengthens civil rights by ensuring that masked or unidentified federal agents, and those pretending to be, are seen, documented, and addressed rather than swept aside. By holding every officer and agency to the same standard, we protect the rights of our immigrant and refugee neighbors and affirm a simple truth: justice is not selective, it is shared.”

The legislation follows the two Executive Orders the mayor signed earlier this month on preparedness and coordination in the event of unilateral troop deployment to Seattle and protecting immigrant and refugee communities from unjust immigration enforcement actions. The second order reaffirms that the City has no role in civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Additionally, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) is currently developing guidance for officers responding to emergency calls where masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people. The increased use of masks and plainclothes officers has led to multiple arrests across the country of civilians impersonating federal immigration enforcement officials, posing a real public safety threat to communities.

“Our officers’ appearance will be consistent when someone calls 9-1-1 for help and Seattle police officers are dispatched. They will show up ready to serve the public with their faces uncovered and their SPD badge and name proudly displayed,” said Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes. “At our core, we are peace officers, and our goal is to protect people and keep the peace.”

“For our client communities to truly feel welcome, it is essential to have protections in place that promote trust and safety for all,” said Malou Chavez, Executive Director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “This legislation is an example of the City of Seattle’s leadership seeking to protect all communities, and we hope that other jurisdictions follow suit.”

The City is also developing an ordinance to prohibit staging and operations of federal immigration activities on City-owned properties. This is intended to prevent federal immigration enforcement from using parking lots and similar spaces for staging, which has occurred in other cities like Chicago.

Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, Seattle has advanced multiple legal and legislative steps to protect residents from his administration’s unlawful actions and funding cuts. Efforts include passing legislation that strengthens local protections for people seeking gender-affirming and reproductive health care; a lawsuit over DEI and gender ideology Executive Orders and unlawful conditioning of funds; a lawsuit challenging threats to cities with sanctuary policies; and a lawsuit over frozen counterterrorism funds through the Securing the Cities program.",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/10/107445313_3180711121967837_4273542399787129931_n.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 16:02:32.139945

NPR reached out multiple times to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin with detailed questions about their social media campaign.
American culture is all cultures.""","If you were to base your entire knowledge of American current events solely on the social media feeds of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), you could easily conclude that the U.S. is at war. Earlier this month, a recruitment video featured on the agency's social media platforms urged viewers to join ICE, stating: ""under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, we've reclaimed our border, secured our nation, and have begun to deport these foreign invaders. Equally important as the task of securing our borders is the task of defending our culture - and what it means to be an American.""

The video is part of a social media and advertising blitz to build public support for the current crackdown, and recruit new immigration agents. Homeland Security's stated mission is law enforcement, immigration, travel security and cybersecurity. Its campaign calling for the protection of American culture from invaders has raised eyebrows, and prompted accusations by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch Project, of promoting a White, Christian nationalist agenda.

Consider the agency's Instagram, which has nearly half a million followers: it's a potpourri of pop culture memes, action film quality videos of ICE raids, and paintings of white settlers expanding West as Native Americans flee into the shadows. There's also a lot of re-imagined vintage World War II style posters, often featuring Uncle Sam calling on Americans to join ICE.

Julio Anta, a graphic novelist, says the vintage quality evokes ""the good old days of America, back when America was great."" The World War II themes, he says, are a call to arms, ""trying to inspire this newer generation to see this fight against immigrants as something in line with the greatest generation [who fought in the second World War].""

There's a long history of illustrations demonizing immigrants in America. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, editorial cartoons regularly attacked Irish, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrants. There's an infamous 19th century newspaper cartoon of Uncle Sam hovering angrily over a melting pot, the caption reads: ""we can't digest the scum."" In another illustration from 1911, a burly immigrant shines a shoe, the caption is a racial slur for Italians and how much garlic they eat.

Anta notes that DHS's social media artwork today almost entirely features White Americans and a romanticized past. ""When I look at these images, I see predominantly white people in it. This is all about a time when society was great for white people, and trying to bring it back to that time again.""

NPR reached out multiple times to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin with detailed questions about their social media campaign. She did not respond.

Anta, the son of Cuban and Colombian immigrants, says he's disheartened by the images. He says the rhetoric, combined with the mass arrests of undocumented immigrants, at times with little or no due process, has made him feel unsafe right now as a Latino man. He carries a picture of his passport with him in case he gets stopped. He's taken aback by the recent DHS's recruitment ad which affirms that ""we know what it means to be an American. Everyone knows what an American is.""

""I think when I was growing up I might have felt included by that statement,"" says Anta. ""I was raised to see America as this place that was made up of immigrants, and that the cultures that we all brought made this country a better place. And now we don't even get that.""

42 percent of Latino voters elected Trump, a historic number for a Republican presidential candidate. But about a year into his presidency, polls show a changing picture: a recent New York Times/Sienna poll show 69% of Hispanics disapprove of the President.

The same poll shows 26 percent of Latinos do support Trump.

Among them, Peter Gonzalez, a 66 year old who lives in Tallahassee, Florida. He says he voted for President Trump in large part because he says he wanted illegal immigration controlled. His own parents are Cuban immigrants, but he emphasizes - they came to the U.S. legally.

""I have no problem with immigrants coming into this country,"" Gonzalez says. ""We are all immigrants. But there's a process, there's procedures, there's background checks. All that stuff needs to be done.""

Gonzalez, a retired Coast Guardsman, supports the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign. Gonzalez identifies as Hispanic and white, but says he's no stranger to anti-Latino racism—he faced it growing up. Still, he insists the DHS rhetoric isn't about race. It's about enforcing immigration law. ""I don't feel targeted. I mean, everybody knows my last name. They know that I'm bilingual. I don't feel that the administration is targeting Latinos.""

Gonzalez rarely uses social media. In fact, our interview marked the first time he'd seen DHS's Instagram recruitment posts. Scrolling through them, his discomfort becomes evident. ""Protect your homeland, defend your culture,"" he repeats aloud. ""Why? I'm ok with 'protect your homeland', meaning illegal criminals coming in. But the second part…"" He stops. ""'Defend your culture'? I don't agree with that. American culture is all cultures.""

Gonzalez says he still supports President Trump's immigration crackdown.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1170x658+0+402/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbb%2Fda%2Fc4fa1da6476cbeb0ca963236b99f%2Fprotectdefend-jpg.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:29.076984

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in a case challenging expedited removal—a process in the law in which border officers can bypass immigration courts and get illegal aliens out quickly. President Trump has expanded this process to its maximum extent authorized by Congress—and the same anti-borders group that had tried and failed to stop him from doing so in his first administration is trying to stop him again.

Before Trump’s first term, and during the Biden Administration, expedited removal was limited to aliens who were caught within 100 miles of any land or sea border and who entered the U.S. without inspection less than 14 days before they were encountered. Using authority granted by Congress, the first Trump Administration expanded the program to include all aliens who are found anywhere in the United States without immigration papers, if they are unable to prove that they have been continuously present in the country for two years. After the weak border enforcement of the Biden interregnum, the second Trump Administration reinstated this expansion.

The plaintiff, and anti-borders activist group, was granted an injunction of the expansion by an activist district court. In its brief on appeal, FAIR shows that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the injunction, because the statute of limitations has run, having begun, under the expedited removal statute, when Trump first expanded the program in 2019, not when he later reinstated that action.

FAIR also shows that the plaintiff’s members—illegal aliens who are not supposed to be in the country at all—lack any protected “liberty interest” in avoiding expedited removal, and thus cannot take the first, necessary step in making out a claim under the Due Process Clause. Even if they could, the expedited removal statute, which provides aliens with notice of the action against them and an opportunity to be heard, affords all the process that is due.

“The Trump Administration has expanded expedited removal to its maximum extent under the law,” said Dale L. Wilcox, executive director and general counsel of FAIR. “This step was made necessary by the tremendous number of illegal aliens in the country, and the immense backlog in our immigration courts. We hope the court sees the major holes in plaintiffs’ case, and does not allow it to slow the removal process down.”

BATON ROUGE – In a stunning violation of a federal court order, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported Chanthila Souvannarath, to Laos. Mr. Souvannarath, who has claims to American citizenship for over 20 years, is now detained in a foreign country despite a federal court ruling that recognized his substantial claim to citizenship and prohibited his removal.

On October 23, Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued a temporary restraining order explicitly prohibiting ICE from removing Souvannarath from the United States. ICE deported him anyway.

""ICE just ignored a federal court order and tore yet another family apart,"" said Alanah Odoms, executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana. ""This is the deportation of someone who has strong claims to American citizenship. This administration has shown it will ignore the courts, ignore the Constitution and ignore the law to pursue its mass deportation agenda, even if it means destroying the lives of American citizens.""

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and entered the United States before his first birthday, receiving lawful permanent residence. He became a U.S. citizen as a minor when his father naturalized and gained sole custody of him, meeting all requirements for derivative citizenship under immigration law at the time.

Despite his citizenship, ICE detained Souvannarath on June 18, 2025, and held him at the notorious Camp 57 detention facility inside Angola prison, Louisiana's former slave plantation turned maximum-security prison. From detention, Souvannarath, representing himself, filed a habeas petition with the federal court seeking recognition of his citizenship and immediate release.

""This should shock the nation,'"" said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. ""The deportation of an individual with a substantial claim to U.S. citizenship represents a catastrophic failure of the immigration system and a flagrant violation of constitutional rights. It raises urgent questions about just how many other people, potentially including other U.S. citizens, have been wrongfully deported because our immigration system does not require legal representation of individuals placed behind bars at jails masquerading as ‘immigration detention centers.’”

""ICE defied a federal court order by deporting Chanthila on Friday,"" said Bridget Pranzatelli, Staff Attorney at the National Immigration Project. ""This should alarm everyone. Federal agencies cannot simply ignore the other branches of government. ICE–like every other federal and state enforcement agency–is bound by the orders of the court. We call for the immediate return of Mr. Souvannarath and for ICE to be held accountable for his flagrantly illegal removal.""

“Mr. Souvannarath's case isn't just about the federal government ignoring a court order,"" said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. ""It's about a chaotic system of mass detention that subjects people to abuse behind bars and unjust deportation. This is what happens when you disappear people to notorious, isolated prisons under the guise of 'civil' detention - you end up wrongfully deporting individuals who have pending federal litigation involving their claims to U.S. citizenship.""

The ACLU of Louisiana, along with its partners at RFK Human Rights and the National Immigration Project, are exploring all legal options to secure Souvannarath's immediate return to the United States and hold ICE accountable.

Why it matters: Abughazaleh is the latest in a series of Democratic politicians facing legal consequences for protest actions against the Trump administration's immigration operations.

The 26-year-old progressive, who is a frontrunner in the race to succeed Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), called the charges ""a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent"" in a statement.

Her lead opponent in the Democratic primary, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, called the protest ""nonviolent"" in a statement, saying he hopes ""these frivolous charges are dropped immediately.""

Driving the news: The indictment accuses Abughazaleh and five others of ""hindering and impeding"" ICE officers by blocking an agency vehicle during an anti-ICE protest in suburban Chicago last month.

The indictment alleges that the defendants ""banged aggressively on the [vehicle's] side and back windows, hood, and other vehicle body parts"" and ""pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement.""

It also accuses them of scratching the vehicle, etching the word ""PIG"" into it and breaking a mirror and a windshield wiper.

The defendants have each been charged with one count of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer and one count of assaulting, resisting, or impeding a federal officer, which carry sentences of up to six and eight years in prison, respectively.

The other side: ""As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included,"" Abughazaleh said in her statement.

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first scheduled, late afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis had ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz. It has produced more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers, at the same time, were appealing her decision. Lawyers for news outlets and activists who say agents have used too much force, including tear gas, have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed enforcement actions in which tear gas was used, including in a neighborhood where children had gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on the city’s Northwest Side. Neighbors had joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” she said. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Meanwhile, prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, alleges they illegally blocked an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

Abughazaleh said the prosecution was an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower court ruling that has blocked the troop deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for a daily 5:45 p.m. briefing to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges, and she’s banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals of enforcement actions have been one-sided.

The indictment makes Abughazaleh the latest Democratic figure to be targeted by the Trump administration for challenging the regime’s aggressive tactics.

Abughazaleh shared the news of her indictment on social media on Wednesday. “This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the first amendment,” she says in the video.

The indictment accuses Abughazaleh — whose name is repeatedly misspelled in the document — of bracing her hands on the hood of an ICE vehicle that was attempting to drive through a group of protesters outside of the Broadview Processing Center, ICE’s Chicago command center.

Since announcing her candidacy, Abughazaleh has made ICE’s violent deployment in Chicago a focal point of her campaign, holding press conferences and participating in protests at Broadview. On social media, she’s documented officers reacting violently to protesters presence: Abughazaleh was slammed to the ground in one incident, and hit in the face with a baton during a separate encounter.

“Since I and others have exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and teargassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot become our new normal,” she says in the video posted Wednesday. “And because Chicago doesn’t back down from bullies in masks who tear gas our neighborhoods, this administration has resorted to weaponizing the federal justice system to scare us into silence. But we’re not going to be silent.”

Abughazaleh announced her bid to primary Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who has represented Illinois’ 9th District since 1999, in March. Soon after, Schakowsky announced her intention to retire when her current term expires, setting the stage for the first competitive primary in the district in almost 30 years.

Editor’s picks

Abughazaleh was the first to announce in a crowded field that had grown to 18 candidates, including two state senators, a state representative, and Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss. A recent poll, conducted by MDW Communications and commissioned by Abughazaleh’s campaign, showed the upstart trailing Bliss by five points, and well ahead of the rest of the field, with nearly half of the electorate undecided.

According to a Public Policy Polling survey conducted in September, two thirds of Evanston residents oppose the aggressive tactics ICE has used in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration adopted regulations giving immigrants with pending renewals of employment authorization documents an automatic extension of 540 days.
Exceptions include extensions for immigrants with employment authorization through the Temporary Protected Status program and or extensions provided by statute.
Immigrants with pending renewal claims have already been screened at least once and sometimes multiple times by the government if they’d previously renewed work permits.
“The primary reason for the work permit auto-extension has been the government’s failure to process work permit applications in a timely fashion—routinely leaving immigrants and their employers waiting for over a year.”","The Trump administration is removing an automatic grace period for immigrants with pending work permit renewals, a move that will force out of the workforce many people stuck in worsening administrative backlogs.

The Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration adopted regulations giving immigrants with pending renewals of employment authorization documents an automatic extension of 540 days. They’d previously received an automatic extension period of 180 days.

Immigrants admitted as refugees, asylum seekers, and dependent visa holders of H-1B workers were among the applicants who benefited from the automatic grace period. Exceptions include extensions for immigrants with employment authorization through the Temporary Protected Status program and or extensions provided by statute.

The interim final rule released Wednesday will take effect October 30. It won’t affect the validity of work permits automatically extended before the rule’s publication, but immigrants who file to renew on or after Oct. 30 won’t receive a grace period.

Immigrants with pending renewal claims have already been screened at least once and sometimes multiple times by the government if they’d previously renewed work permits. But DHS said more frequent vetting allowed by ending automatic extensions will better enable the government to detect fraud.

Joseph Edlow, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the Biden administration had “prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security.”

“It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” he said in a statement. “All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”

Immigrants can file to renew employment authorization documents up to 180 days before they expire. As of June 30, more than 47,000 renewal applications were pending six months or more for asylum applicants and more than 165,000 renewals were pending for all work permit holders.

Without major improvements to processing times, the ripple effects of the move will be catastrophic for immigrants, as well as their employers and communities that rely on them to fill critical jobs, said Conchita Cruz, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project.

“Asylum seekers and other immigrant workers are valued employees and colleagues, and provide critical services to local U.S. communities,” Cruz said. “The primary reason for the work permit auto-extension has been the government’s failure to process work permit applications in a timely fashion—routinely leaving immigrants and their employers waiting for over a year.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/1c309f8/2147483647/crop/4000x1542+0+672/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fd0%2Fabe660d340e0bbb8d299161209eb%2F427710899-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:34.280457

(WCIA) — The man accused of crashing into a vehicle with four people inside — killing two and sending another two to the hospital — has been issued an immigration detainer, an ICE spokesperson said.

Illinois State Police previously told WCIA that 34-year-old Edwin Pacheco-Meza was traveling eastbound at West Lincoln Street near South Division Street in Westfield Friday evening. He then reportedly crossed the center line and hit a truck head-on. A Coles County board member and his wife were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, ISP confirmed. The other two passengers were taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. Pacheco-Meza and his passenger weren’t hurt.

WCIA previously reported that Pacheco-Meza was facing a charge of reckless homicide and two counts of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol. Now, he is facing three additional charges:

No valid license/ permit never issued

Class B Misdemeanor

Not driving on the right side of the road

Class P Other

Failure to reduce speed

Class P Other

According to ICE, Pacheco-Meza was living in the county illegally; they said he is from Honduras.

ICE said they issued an immigration detainer for Pacheco-Meza, which requests two things from law enforcement agencies:

ICE is asking to be notified “as early has possible” if and when Pacheco-Meza is released.

The detainer requests holding him for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily release them. ICE said this would allow DHS time to assume custody.

During a detention hearing on Monday, Pacheco-Meza was denied pretrial release.

ICE added that Pacheco-Meza’s passenger was also living in the country illegally. The 18-year-old is reportedly from Guatemala and is now being processed to face immigration proceedings.

On Sunday, State Representative Adam Niemerg (R-Dieterich) released a statement regarding Friday night’s crash:

“The driver who hit Coles County Board member Mike Clayton and his wife Gail was in the U.S. ILLEGALLY. More lives lost because of failed leadership. Governor JB Pritzker’s reckless policies keep putting Illinois families at risk,” he wrote in a post on social media.

Previously, Illinois State Police told WCIA that Pacheco-Meza was living in Indianapolis.

State Senator Chapin Rose (R-Mahomet) also shared a statement following the crash. Rose said Illinois’ laws protect people living in the country illegally over citizens.

“Worse yet, under Illinois’s idiotic laws that protect illegals and criminals over citizens – laws that Governor Pritzker refuses to fix – the Clark County Sheriff is not even allowed to enforce the ICE order to detain the suspect, Edwin O. Pacheco-Meza,” Rose said in a statement shared to his website. “It is also totally ridiculous that the Illinois State Police have apparently been ordered not to release the citizenship status of the suspect – hiding the basic details of this tragedy from the public at large.”

When asked to confirm if Pacheco-Meza was living in the United State legally, State Police said that they are prohibited from inquiring about or investigating the citizenship or immigration status of any individual in their custody, per the Illinois TRUST Act.

This crash follows a similar tragedy that took place in Urbana at the beginning of 2025. Julio Bol of Guatemala is accused of rear-ending a Honda Civic at University and Coler Avenues in Urbana. The crash ended the lives of 21-year-old Chloe Polzin from Deerfield and 20-year-old Katherine Abraham of Glenview. Three other passengers in the Honda Civic were hurt.

Recent immigration enforcement in Chicago — Operation Midway Blitz — is in honor of Katie, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.

In a statement sent to WCIA on Tuesday, an ICE spokesperson said the agency is committing to remove people living in the United States illegally.

This rule is effective for Automatic EAD extensions for renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025. Who is impacted by this rule?
The rule does not affect: Automatic extensions already granted by the timely filing of an EAD renewal application prior to the publication date of October 30, 2025; or Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., Temporary Protected Status (TPS) notices).
Employers are reminded to reverify employment authorization before the current EAD expires as failure to do so may result in significant penalties.","On October 29, 2025, DHS provided an advanced notice of the Interim Final Rule (IFR) titled “Removal of the Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization Documents” (8 CFR §274a.13(e)) to be published on October 30, 2025. The effective date is upon publication in the Federal Register, October 30, 2025, and the comment deadline will be 30 days from publication.

What does this rule do?

This rule eliminates the automatic 540-day extension of certain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for noncitizens that had timely filed a Form I-765 application to renew their EAD. This rule is applicable to those individuals that have obtained work authorization based on one of the category codes listed by USCIS here. This rule is effective for Automatic EAD extensions for renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025.

Who is impacted by this rule?

For EAD renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025, applicants – that are not eligible for an exception noted above – will now be required to wait for USCIS adjudication and issuance of a new EAD before continuing employment after their EAD card expires unless they have an alternative option for work authorization.

The rule does not affect:

Automatic extensions already granted by the timely filing of an EAD renewal application prior to the publication date of October 30, 2025; or

Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., Temporary Protected Status (TPS) notices).

It is important to note that if a noncitizen provides an EAD card as evidence of work authorization with one of the category codes referenced above, together with a Form I-797C (Receipt Notice) that shows a timely filed EAD renewal application filed prior to October 30, 2025, they are still eligible for the 540-day automatic extension.

Why is this rule being published?

USCIS cites national security and vetting concerns, stating that automatic extensions allowed continued employment without full eligibility review and may “allow bad actors to continue to work and generate income to potentially finance nefarious activities that pose an imminent threat to the American public.”

DHS acknowledges that this rule may cause employment authorization gaps and operational strain for employers but asserts that public safety and program integrity take priority.

What are important takeaways for Employers?

Employers are reminded to reverify employment authorization before the current EAD expires as failure to do so may result in significant penalties. It is even more essential that employers track the expiration of work authorization for noncitizens and take appropriate employment action if an individual is unable to provide evidence of continued work authorization – either through a timely filed extension (if applicable) or a new work authorization document (if applicable).

Actions employers can take:

Remind employees to file renewal applications early.

Review current EAD cards to determine potential lapses in work authorization and prepare accordingly.

Plan for increased processing delays and employment disruptions during USCIS backlogs.

Provide immediate notice to any eligible individuals to file the extension/renewal EAD applications online via the myUSCIS account today, October 29, 2025. Such individuals include:

(a)(12) – Temporary Protected Status granted(c)(3)(A) – F-1 student, pre-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT);(c)(3)(B) – F-1 student, post-completion OPT;(c)(3)(C) – F-1 student, 24-month extension of OPT for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students;(c)(8) – Application for Employment Authorization Based on Pending Form I-589, Application for Asylum or for Withholding of Removal, and Applicants for Pending Asylum under the ABC Settlement Agreement;(c)(11) – Paroled for urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit purposes;(c)(19) – Certain pending TPS applicants who USCIS has determined are prima facie eligible for TPS and who may then receive an EAD as a “temporary treatment benefit” under 8 C.F.R. 244.10(a); or

(c)(33) – Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) You must have a pending or approved Form I-821D to file Form I-765.

NOTE: Employees who present an expired EAD card for an eligible category plus the Form I-797C (Receipt Notice) for which a renewal/extension was timely filed with USCIS prior to October 30, 2025 remain eligible for the 540-day automatic extension through the 540-day period even if the documents are presented for verification of work authorization on or after October 30, 2025.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-1-2.png,N,,2025-10-29 14:57:32.406486

Carrillo was captured on video dramatically smashing in federal agents' windows on the pot farm. A female, a known anti-ICE ""agitator"" who allegedly trails agents and posts videos, was also wanted at the same address as Carrillo.

However, she escaped arrest Wednesday morning and is potentially going to be named a fugitive, authorities said.

Wednesday's arrests were part of a broader, sweeping take down across Los Angeles of suspects wanted for allegedly engaging in violence against law enforcement during this summer’s chaotic protests across the city.

Around 10 arrests are expected to be announced, Fox News has learned.

The raids allegedly associated with Carrillo happened in July when federal authorities targeted Glass House Farms in Camarillo and another site in Carpinteria.

More than 300 people were arrested, and one farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof. In addition, 14 minor immigrant children were found on the properties, authorities said.

The raids were part of the Trump administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations.

U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick last week ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep Chanthila “Shawn” Souvannarath, 44, in the United States while he presented what the judge called his “substantial claim of U.S. citizenship,"" court records show. He was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but was granted lawful permanent residence in the U.S. before his first birthday, according to court filings.

But Souvannarath on Sunday messaged his wife on WhatsApp and told her he was in Dongmakkhai, Laos, according to a screenshot she shared with The Associated Press. The message ends with “love y'all.”

“It is very unfortunate, especially for the children that we have together,” Beatrice Souvannarath told AP.

Emails, phone calls and text messages sent to ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security were not immediately returned.

The ACLU of Louisiana, which is representing Souvannarath, called the deportation a “stunning violation of a federal court order.” Before his deportation, Souvannarath had been detained at a newly opened ICE facility at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.

“ICE just ignored a federal court order and tore yet another family apart,” said Alanah Odoms, executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana, in a statement. “This administration has shown it will ignore the courts, ignore the Constitution and ignore the law to pursue its mass deportation agenda, even if it means destroying the lives of American citizens.”

The deportation comes as Trump administration officials have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants. There have been previous cases of U.S. citizens being deported, including U.S.-born children.

Chanthila Souvannarath was taken into ICE custody in June following an annual check-in with immigration authorities in Alabama, where he had been living, his wife said.

“When he went to check in, they detained him. And our two younger kids were with him,"" Beatrice Souvannarath told AP. ""It was the hardest two months of my life.”

He spent much of his childhood living with one or both of his parents in Hawaii, Washington state and California. His father, a native of Laos, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Souvannarath claims his citizenship derives from that status.

“I continuously lived in the United States since infancy,” Souvannarath wrote in a letter from immigration detention, “and I have always considered myself an American citizen.”

Souvannarath filed an emergency motion seeking to delay his deportation. Dick, the federal judge based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, issued a temporary restraining order Thursday, citing the “irreparable harm that would be caused by immediate deportation.”

""Though the government has an interest in the enforcement of its immigration laws, the potential removal of a U.S. citizen weighs heavily against the public interest,"" wrote Dick, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Barack Obama. Souvannarath would be “unable to effectively litigate his case from Laos,"" she added.

The court docket shows no changes in Souvannarath’s case since the judge issued the temporary restraining order, which was set to expire Nov. 6. Dick declined to through her office to comment.

Democratic leaders attending the APEC summit should speak strongly in reaffirming that human rights and democratic principles are universal standards enshrined in international law.
Democratic governments meeting at APEC need to stand up and defend the international system and its vital systems and institutions.","U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will meet on October 30 during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. Media headlines will focus on trade and tariffs. But away from the limelight of the great powers boxing ring and the fears about how China-U.S. competition is impacting global economics, what lurks in the shadows is far more disturbing.

The meeting comes at a time of intensifying authoritarianism, accelerating democratic backsliding, and general deterioration in the international order, fueled in large part by Trump’s and Xi’s attacks on the international human rights system.

With both China and the United States, the attacks on international norms are linked to abuses at home.

In China, Xi started his tenure in late 2012 with an explicit focus on seven political “perils,” including universal values and human rights. Since then, repression has intensified across China, and radiated from its borderlands to outside its borders, as Beijing subjected Uyghurs to crimes against humanity, eradicated freedoms in Hong Kong, and expanded harassment and surveillance of diaspora communities abroad.

In the U.S., in just nine months in office Trump has quickly ramped up attacks on democratic norms that began during his first term. His administration is now threatening the very foundations of democratic rule in the United States, disregarding the country’s constitutional system of checks and balances while threatening institutions perceived to be critical of him. He has deployed the national guard in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere, and greatly expanded abusive immigration raids and forced deportations without due process.

On the international stage, both leaders’ hostility toward people’s inherent dignity and the rule of law has translated into efforts to openly undermine the United Nations’ core human rights infrastructure and its multilateral agencies. Each government has worked in its own way to undermine the International Criminal Court, the court of last resort for grave international crimes.

The U.S. has curtailed its voluntary contributions to the United Nations and withdrawn from numerous U.N. institutions that other governments attending APEC have invested in for decades, including the World Health Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Council, and other multilateral agencies that promote global action against epidemics, atrocity crimes, and climate change.

China, although having long presented itself as a champion of multilateralism at the U.N., has been aggressively silencing criticism at the U.N. of its own human rights record. It has repeatedly sought to defund U.N. human rights institutions, block or weaken U.N. resolutions on civil society, human rights defenders, and peaceful protests, and advanced innocuous-sounding concepts like “win-win cooperation” that are meant to dilute the concept of accountability.

These actions, alongside Russia’s similarly destructive actions against the U.N. system, appear aimed to dismantle the international human rights system and multilateral action, and cement a more lawless world order in which geopolitical strength reigns supreme.

At a summit dominated by two leaders who have demonstrated such utter hostility to the international system, human rights law, and democratic principles, how should rights-respecting, democratic countries respond?

With courage and conviction.

Democratic leaders attending the APEC summit should speak strongly in reaffirming that human rights and democratic principles are universal standards enshrined in international law. They should unabashedly defend the U.N. system and the international rule of law. They should publicly state their opposition to attacks on multilateral institutions by both China and the U.S. and call on both to restore and sustain U.N. funding.

Democratic governments should also pledge to establish an Asia Democracy Defense Fund, to mitigate the harm to human rights defenders and civil society in the region. A fund would provide a vital lifeline to human rights defenders and independent journalists now increasingly at risk due to growing repression and cuts to U.S. foreign funding.

Democratic leaders should also forge an action plan to create safe havens in democratic countries in Asia and across the world, so activists and journalists – many of them now in exile – can continue to function effectively. The action plan should include a special resettlement stream for human rights defenders, similar to one created in Canada, to protect activists from cross-border repression and other.

The U.S. and Chinese governments’ attacks on the international order are undermining global institutions and efforts that many governments in the rest of the world care deeply about, and have invested in, for decades. Democratic governments meeting at APEC need to stand up and defend the international system and its vital systems and institutions.

The speakers will discuss the paper titled “The Pre-Removal Detention of Immigrants: A Return to Ordinary Meaning” by Bas Schotel and Ingo Venzke.

About the paper:

The EU Return Directive demands that immigrant detention be as short as possible, but, by logical implication, this also means that detention can be as long as necessary. What concerns the maximum length of detention, the Return Directive is remarkably generous: Immigrants can be detained for a period of up to eighteen months—a deprivation of liberty that is otherwise justified only as punishment for serious crimes. The practice of such long-term detention, now burgeoning, is highly questionable for moral, practical, and—our focus—legal reasons.

The European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) provides the relevant yardstick. While discussions on the legality of immigrant detention have focused on requirements of necessity, we shift attention towards the surprisingly absent question of maximum duration. Our analysis delves into the drafting context of the ECHR to reveal that it only authorizes the pre-removal detention of immigrants for markedly short periods. Picking up the interpretative canon of the regime, we note that meanings can of course change, but we argue that it is a legal mistake to consider that long-term detention is now sanctioned by the Convention.",https://www.hertie-school.org/fileadmin/_processed_/c/3/csm_Event_Immigration_Detention_Establishing_Clear_Boundaries_in_International_Human_Rights_Law_6f01cc1e79.png,N,,2025-10-29 16:02:36.375154

And while Trump promised to target criminals, immigrants with no criminal record comprise the largest group of people being held.
Although he had followed all government orders and broken no laws, he was sent to immigration detention and fast-tracked for deportation.
Agents have arrested over 1,600 people who appeared for routine hearings only to be snatched by armed, masked ICE agents.","Under the Trump administration, thousands of people who have not broken any laws currently sit trapped in detention centers without any idea if or when they will be able to return to their families and communities. In addition, they’re enduring terrible conditions such as extreme overcrowding, inadequate food and hygiene, and lack of access to legal counsel.

The administration’s agenda is clear: forcing immigrants to endure months or even years of detention under inhumane conditions while their cases make their way through the backlogged immigration system ensures that people will give up and agree to return to their home countries. Even when their cases are likely to succeed, eventually giving them the right to remain lawfully in the U.S., many are unwilling to endure the squalor and uncertainty.

There are some signs the plan is working. The AP recently reported that, while it’s impossible to know how many immigrants have fled the U.S. voluntarily since Trump took office, “The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, said judges granted ‘voluntary departure’ in 15,241 cases in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. That compares with 8,663 voluntary departures for the previous fiscal year.”

Trump’s mass deportation agenda involves flooding America’s streets, businesses, and courthouses with ICE agents to terrorize, arrest, and detain immigrants in intolerable conditions for long periods of time. The ultimate goal is to dramatically increase the number of people who are deported from America, many of whom have legally valid bases to stay in the country.

Thousands of New Yorkers Swept Up, Detained, Deported

Trump isn’t just keeping immigrants locked up for longer while their cases wind slowly through immigration court. His administration is also arresting, detaining, and deporting more people.

A Times Union analysis of ICE data found that agents arrested over 4,600 New Yorkers in the first seven months of 2025, more than the total number arrested in the year prior. Some New Yorkers were arrested on their way to work, waiting at bus stops, or taking their children to school. Most appeared to have ongoing immigration cases.

The number of people deported also surged during these months, the Times Union reports. Over 300 people arrested by ICE were deported between January and July, with at least 170 leaving voluntarily – six times the number of people who did so in 2024.

The harm caused by the Trump administration’s action is immeasurable. Whether trapped in a detention facility or on the other side of the border, tearing New Yorkers from the lives they have built here has devastating ripple effects. Children lose the loving presence of their parent. Families lose their income, their homes, and their vehicles. And employers lose their best workers, leaving them unable to fulfil contracts. Whole communities, our economy and our state suffer under Trump’s mass deportation scheme.

An Impossible Choice

Prolonged detention – in deplorable conditions – has increasingly become a threat hanging over the heads of people who entered the country legally and have broken no law.

They face a cruel ultimatum: to deport themselves voluntarily or remain in detention for however long it takes their immigration cases to navigate the overburdened system.

Each person who leaves brings Trump one step closer to his purported goal of removing millions of immigrants from the country. ICE detentions have ballooned since he took office in January, reaching a record high of over 60,000 in August. And while Trump promised to target criminals, immigrants with no criminal record comprise the largest group of people being held.

Under previous administrations, immigrants were primarily arrested by Customs and Border Patrol agents in regions close to the border, often shortly after entering the country. But ICE agents are now making a majority of arrests in the country’s interior, spreading fear among immigrants who having been living in their communities for years and even decades.

How We’re Fighting Back

Critically, the government does not have authority to indefinitely detain anyone who is not a flight risk or a danger to others. Stripping people of their right to release is not only cruel, it’s illegal.

Here are some of the ways we are fighting back and demanding that the administration respect the rights of immigrant New Yorkers.

A Teen Illegally Detained by ICE

When 19-year-old Oliver Mata Velazquez dutifully showed up to his immigration court appointment in Buffalo in June, he was abducted by ICE agents. Although he had followed all government orders and broken no laws, he was sent to immigration detention and fast-tracked for deportation. But the NYCLU, Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights sued. And we won his release. Oliver is now back home with his family, in his community, while his asylum case proceeds.

A Buffalo Asylum Seeker Locked Up for Over Seven Months

We’re working with Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights to secure the release of another Buffalo resident who has been subjected to a prolonged and illegal detention. Our client fled political persecution in Cuba and entered the U.S. legally through the CPBOne app. He applied for legal status under the Cuban Adjustment Act and received work papers and a social security number. But in February of 2025, he was falsely accused of a petty crime and turned over to ICE. The charges were dismissed, yet ICE has kept him detained ever since in the Batavia detention facility near Buffalo – a facility notorious for its egregious conditions.

Weaponizing Courthouses

Since Trump was sworn into office in January, the epicenter of ICE arrests in New York has been the immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. Agents have arrested over 1,600 people who appeared for routine hearings only to be snatched by armed, masked ICE agents. This cruel policy denies people their right to due process and undermines the functioning of our immigration courts, and along with the ACLU, Make the Road New York, and Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, we’re suing to end ICE’s courthouse arrests.

Inhumane Conditions in ICE Detention Facilities

ICE has been unable to safely hold the surge of people they’re detaining in courthouse arrests, and at 26 Federal Plaza immigrants were made to sleep on the floor of temporary holding cells intended for only hours of use. Yet for days and even weeks at a time, immigrants trapped in these overcrowded quarters were denied changes of clothing, basic hygiene items, adequate food and access to legal counsel. Along with the ACLU, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP, we sued to put a stop to this inhumane treatment, and a judge granted a preliminary injunction requiring the government to reduce overcrowding, provide sleeping mats, improve access to hygiene and ensure that people can make unmonitored calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

A Bronx High Schooler Illegally Detained

Our client, Joel, is a 16-year-old Bronx high school student. He has special immigrant juvenile status, which generally shields minors from deportation. Yet with breathtaking disregard for both the law and basic human decency, ICE agents snatched Joel when he showed up for a mandatory, routine immigration check-in.

Not long ago, just one location in New Hampshire held detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: the Strafford County Jail, which has done so for decades.

In passing that law, Republicans have said sanctuary policies present a threat to the public by allowing, in Ayotte’s words, “dangerous criminals” into communities.","Over the past nine months, Megan Chapman has seen the federal government run deportation flights out of the Portsmouth International Airport.

Chapman heard about several counties considering deals with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with four county sheriff’s offices, seven local police departments and New Hampshire State Police signing onto agreements deputizing them to assist ICE and enforce federal immigration laws.

She watched as the federal prison in Berlin began to house immigration detainees earlier this year. Not long ago, just one location in New Hampshire held detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: the Strafford County Jail, which has done so for decades.

Then, she decided to take action.

Chapman, a human rights lawyer from the North Country town of Albany, is one of many people participating in so-called “sanctuary communities,” a grassroots effort that seeks to create a network of people across New Hampshire to monitor and document ICE activities and advocate against what they call “police-state tactics” by the Trump administration.

“We’ve come together to reaffirm and uphold the best values upon which our nation is built and to root out and cure the worst human instincts that the rhetoric of this moment is trying to unleash,” she told a small crowd at Saint Paul’s Episcopal Church in Concord on Tuesday. “Practically, we must also push back the effort to lay the infrastructure for the authoritarian state and terror regime on our own soil, here in New Hampshire.”

The network of eight groups across the state — some new, others that have existed for several years — seeks to offer trainings on bystanders’ right to witness and record what’s happening in their community, Chapman said.

State Republicans say they’re keeping a close watch on activists and are prepared to punish anyone who crosses the line.

“Threats to law enforcement or efforts to obstruct them will not be tolerated in New Hampshire,” Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in a press release. “If you disrupt law enforcement activity, you will be prosecuted.”

State Rep. Joe Sweeney, the deputy majority leader of the Republican caucus that controls the House of Representatives, warned undocumented immigrants in his statement: “If you are here illegally, you are not welcome in New Hampshire,” he said. “You cannot hide. We will find you and deport you.”

Ayotte signed a law earlier this year banning cities and towns from adopting so-called “sanctuary” and “welcoming” policies designed to keep local police from assisting federal immigration enforcement. In passing that law, Republicans have said sanctuary policies present a threat to the public by allowing, in Ayotte’s words, “dangerous criminals” into communities.

Most people detained by ICE and border patrol have no criminal convictions.

Of the nearly 60,000 people detained in the U.S., less than a third have been convicted of a crime, according to the most recently available federal data. Roughly 15,000 detainees have pending criminal charges, and more than 27,700 people were designated as “other immigration violators.”

As Republicans keep a close watch, activists said they have no intention of breaking the law. They do intend to do everything in their legal rights to protect others from what they view as unlawful actions by ICE.

Bob Baker, an immigrant and a lawyer who lives in Columbia, said federal agents arresting and detaining people off the streets — sometimes while masked and in unmarked vehicles — denies those people of due process in the courts.

Towns and cities in New Hampshire can no longer instruct their local police not to cooperate with ICE, and while lawsuits are an option, Chapman said that path of resistance could jeopardize state or federal funding. Individual community members can still put pressure on institutions, she said.

“By forming a citizens’ movement, No. 1, we make it not about towns and cities and authorities,” Chapman said. “It’s about human beings and citizens saying, ‘We don’t accept this.”

The sanctuary communities plan to host trainings and come up with ways to share information across the network. In the meantime, though, they’re still figuring it out.

“We’re going step by step. We’re not highly sophisticated. We’re just relatively ordinary citizens,” said Larry Brown, an organizer from Lancaster. “This is what citizen movements are about. They grow, and they turn here and there. We don’t know where this is going. We don’t know… if we’re going to be successful, whatever that might mean. This is truly the David and Goliath moment in our history.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.concordmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P1010137-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-29 11:19:05.578277

(San Francisco Chronicle) — Opponents of Prop 36, the tough-on-crime ballot measure California voters approved last year, say it has failed to provide “mass treatment” for drug offenders.","CAMPAIGN FORESHADOWING — As the shutdown standoff over health care funding drags on, GOP leaders are trying to rope one of California’s signature policies into the debate.

For weeks, the Republicans’ messaging has targeted health care for undocumented immigrants — accusing congressional Democrats of demanding federal dollars flow to people in the country illegally as a condition of reopening the government, while separately charging California with exploiting a federal loophole to pay for its in-state program.

The attacks offer a preview of what Gov. Gavin Newsom — who in 2022 approved a major expansion of the state’s Medicaid program — might expect if he enters the presidential race in 2028. California was the first state to offer health insurance to unauthorized immigrants of all ages with low incomes, and GOP figures have used the program’s very existence to make the case that Democrats prioritize immigrants over U.S. citizens.

“It was Gavin Newsom who made this an issue by doing something no other state has done,” said Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican and frequent Newsom antagonist. “It is an interesting contrast when you have all of these national (Democratic) political figures who are saying ‘no no no, that’s not something we would ever do.’”

Democrats have condemned the Republican attacks as misleading or outright false, accusing them of conflating state and federal programs and noting the law prohibits federal dollars from flowing to undocumented immigrants. Newsom has repeatedly called the GOP out for what he calls bald-faced lies about California’s program, which runs entirely on state funding — a point echoed by New York Democrats.

More broadly, Newsom and fellow Democrats argue the GOP is trying to distract from its own record, distorting facts to shift the shutdown conversation away from unpopular health care cuts — including the looming expiration of popular Obamacare subsidies, a central sticking point for Washington Democrats. The governor denounced Republicans’ strategy as “pathetic.”

“It also shows how wrong they are, and the overwhelming now bipartisan opposition to these massive increases in health care costs that are going in effect in January,” Newsom said. “That’s why they’re desperate to paint a different picture.”

But the GOP has a penchant for pivoting to immigration. And if 2020 and 2024 are any indication, it’s likely to be a focus again in 2028. If Newsom is in the race, California’s program is likely to come into the spotlight.

“Republicans are returning to an issue that’s a winner to them: Any time they’re talking about benefits for undocumented or illegal immigrants, that’s a winner for them,” said David Gilliard, a California-based Republican consultant.

California’s program has continually courted controversy. Newsom has defended it as fiscally wise and morally righteous. But he pared the initiative back this summer as soaring costs helped fuel a massive budget deficit, angering liberal supporters and vindicating Republican foes who had long called the idea unsustainable.

The political dynamics in Republican-controlled Washington are starkly different than in Democratic-dominated states like California. While a national Pew poll late last year found Americans overwhelmingly opposed offering public benefits to immigrants, California voters broadly favor extending coverage to the state’s huge undocumented population. That support rose this summer as Trump threw a deportation dragnet over cities like Los Angeles.

There’s a history there: In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson’s push to cut off state aid to undocumented immigrants drew a stark dividing line in California’s politics, helping to enshrine a semi-permanent Democratic majority by activating a generation of Latino voters and politicians like Sen. Alex Padilla.

“There was a general feeling for many years, post-Pete Wilson, that the Pete Wilson immigration attacks backfired on the (Republican) party,” said Anthony Wright, who heads the health care advocacy organization Families USA and spent years advocating for universal insurance coverage in California. “The temperature was turned down partially because they didn’t want to fall into the trap they felt Pete Wilson did.”

Fast forward 30 years and California’s program even drew bipartisan support as recently as last year, with Republican then-Assemblymember Devon Mathis arguing it reduced cost pressures on straining rural hospitals. But Mathis said in an interview that the White House believes it is channeling the will of voters.

“This is another one of those 80/20 issues,” Mathis said, “where the Trump administration has figured out that people are tired of paying for people who aren’t here legally.”

IN THE COURTS

ESSAYLI RULING — A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, has been illegally serving in the role since July, Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report.

The former Republican Assembly member left the Legislature in April after President Donald Trump picked him to serve in the role. But Essayli should have departed the post by July 31 under a 120-day limit imposed by federal law, U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright concluded.

An unusual maneuver by Attorney General Pam Bondi to extend Essayli’s tenure into 2026 violated federal appointment laws, the Hawaii-based George W. Bush appointee ruled.

“Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California,” Seabright concluded. “Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney … He is disqualified from serving in that role.”

Essayli emphasized in a post on X that the ruling permits him to continue serving as the highest-ranking official in the office he oversaw, even if he can’t hold the title of U.S. attorney.

“Nothing is changing,” he wrote.

Essayli did not address another possibility: Under federal law, the judges of the Central District of California could appoint some other attorney to fill the U.S. attorney post until Trump can get a nominee confirmed to the post.

The Justice Department declined to comment, while Sen. Adam Schiff criticized the Trump administration for leaving Essayli in place.

“‘Unlawfully serving’ in his role. Acting illegally. But left in place? While this Administration continues to replace career professionals with illegitimate political allies eager to do Trump’s bidding, Californians need better relief than this,” Schiff said in a statement.

POLLING PLACE

WITH VOTES TO SPARE — More than half of likely voters are planning to support California Democrats’ redistricting ballot measure next week, a new poll shows.

The survey from the Public Policy Institute found that, of the 56 percent of likely voters who plan to support the Nov. 4 measure, 95 percent disapprove of how Trump is handling his job, while 86 percent approve of Newsom’s performance as governor. As Juliann Ventura reports, 43 percent of voters say they will be voting no on Proposition 50, according to the poll, which was conducted by Ipsos.

Regardless of political party, nearly 70 percent of likely voters say that the outcome of the special election is “very important” to them.

MORE ON REDISTRICTING

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: AD ALERT — Reproductive Freedom for All will today debut a new ad in support of Proposition 50, Democrats’ Nov. 4 redistricting measure. The group said it’s making a “five-figure” digital buy to target voters in the battleground districts of Republican Reps. Young Kim and David Valadao.

The spot argues that supporting Prop 50 will help “defend reproductive freedom right now,” a familiar argument that Democrats have deployed as they seek to convince voters that passing the measure will help put a check on Trump’s policies and grip on power in Washington.

Top Talkers

TAKING A PASS — The GOP’s efforts to redraw congressional maps in red states before the midterm elections are hitting roadblocks from state-level Republicans. As Andrew Howard writes, Trump’s team is finding there are some Republicans who simply won’t budge — despite threats and force — on a legally questionable strategy that would grow the GOP’s advantage in next year’s fight to keep the House.

“Trump absolutely controls the national narrative on a day to day basis … but politics continues to be local,” said GOP operative Matthew Bartlett, a New Hampshire native. “It’s hard enough to run the show on the national level; good luck to you getting way into the details and weeds on a state level.”

BLAME GAME — Several Democratic states are blaming Trump and Republicans in Congress for the government shutdown on government websites, as the funding cliff for the millions who rely on federally funded food aid — which is known as SNAP — rapidly approaches, write Jacob Wendler and Cheyanne M. Daniels.

A POLITICO review of all 50 states and D.C.’s SNAP websites found that most have added notices to state webpages about federal benefits. But a handful of Democratic-controlled states — Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania — are using the sites to draw attention to their political opponents. California calls out the “failures of Trump and Congress,” which is under GOP control.

SEE YOU IN COURT — Florida’s Attorney General James Uthmeier is once again taking California to court. On Tuesday, Uthmeier announced that he is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a complaint that alleges California’s tax system is unconstitutional and is calculated in a way that penalizes multi-state corporations that relocate. He also criticized Newsom in the announcement.

As Gary Fineout reports for subscribers, Uthmeier argues Florida has no other alternative way to challenge the tax rules being used by California than to file directly with the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, Uthmeier asked the Supreme Court to force California and Washington to stop issuing commercial driver’s licenses to people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.

FIRED TO HIRED — Newsom has hired Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento who was fired by Trump, as a deputy legal affairs secretary, The New York Times reports. “Michele brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law,” Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom, told the Times. “Trump’s loss is California’s gain.”

BOVINO BACKSTORY — Gregory Bovino, Trump’s top immigration enforcer charged with handpicking new leaders at ICE, first engaged his controversial tactics in California, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. His El Centro sector carried out “Operation Return to Sender,” a surprise January raid in Bakersfield that ensnared U.S. citizens, and he has been on the ground for several immigration raids in California and elsewhere.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday that he believes U.S. military members will be paid at the end of the week, but did not specify how the Trump administration will reconfigure funding in the second-longest government shutdown.

The funding fight in Washington gained new urgency this week as millions of Americans face the prospect of losing food assistance, more federal workers miss their first full paycheck and recurring delays at airports snarl travel plans.

The building strain on lawmakers to end the impasse was magnified by the nation's largest federal employee union, which called Monday on Congress to immediately pass a funding bill and ensure workers receive full pay. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the two political parties have made their point.

""It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship,"" said Kelley, whose union carries considerable political weight with Democratic lawmakers.

Still, Democratic senators, including those representing states with many federal workers, did not appear ready to back down. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he was insisting on commitments from the White House to prevent the administration from mass firing more workers. Democrats also want Congress to extend subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act.

“We’ve got to get a deal with Donald Trump,” Kaine said.

But shutdowns grow more painful the longer they go. Soon, with closures lasting a fourth full week as of Tuesday, millions of Americans are likely to experience the difficulties firsthand.

“This week, more than any other week, the consequences become impossible to ignore,"" said Rep. Lisa McClain, chair of the House Republican Conference.

Shutdown's impact is set to grow dramatically

The nation’s 1.3 million active-duty service members are at risk of missing a paycheck on Friday. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ensured they were paid by shifting $8 billion from military research and development funds to make payroll. But it is unclear if the Trump administration is willing — or able — to shift money again.

Larger still, the Trump administration says funding will run out Friday for the food assistance program that is relied upon by 42 million Americans to supplement their grocery bills. The administration has rejected the use of more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits flowing into November. And it says states won't be reimbursed if they temporarily cover the cost of benefits next month.

The Agriculture Department says the contingency fund is intended to help respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Democrats say the decision concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, goes against the department's previous guidance concerning its operations during a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the administration made an intentional choice not to the fund SNAP in November, calling it an ""act of cruelty.”

Another program endangered by the shutdown is Head Start, with more than 130 preschool programs not getting federal grants on Saturday if the shutdown continues, according to the National Head Start Association. All told, more than 65,000 seats at Head Start programs across the country could be affected.

Will lawmakers find a solution?

At the Capitol, congressional leaders mostly highlighted the challenges many Americans are facing as a result of the shutdown. But there was no movement toward negotiations as they attempted to lay blame on the other side of the political aisle.

“Now government workers and every other American affected by this shutdown have become nothing more than pawns in the Democrats’ political games,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

The House passed a short-term continuing resolution on Sept. 19 to keep federal agencies funded. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of legislative session ever since, saying the solution is for Democrats to simply accept that bill.

But the Senate has consistently fallen short of the 60 votes needed to advance that spending measure. Democrats insist that any bill to fund the government also address health care costs, namely the soaring health insurance premiums that millions of Americans will face next year under plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's 13th attempt to advance the House-passed measure failed once again Tuesday.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed

The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday. In past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has allowed Americans to preview their health coverage options about a week before open enrollment.

As of Monday, Healthcare.gov appeared to show 2025 health insurance plans and estimated prices, instead of next year’s options. CMS was expected to temporarily bring back all its workers furloughed during the shutdown, in part to manage the ACA open enrollment period.

Twenty-eight senators, mostly Democrats, signed a letter urging Trump’s administration to let ACA enrollees start previewing next year’s health insurance options on its marketplace website.

Republicans insist they will not entertain negotiations on health care until the government reopens.

“I’m particularly worried about premiums going up for working families,” said Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa. ""So we’re going to have that conversation, but we’re not going to have it until the government opens.”

Congressional leaders dig in deeper

Schumer said Republicans would prefer to shut the government down than work with Democrats in preventing massive spikes in their health insurance costs. He said the average American doesn’t want to pay an extra $20,000 a year to cover their health insurance.

“And we Democrats want to solve this crisis right away,” Schumer said. “So lowering health care is not a crazy demand.”

Vice President JD Vance attended a Republican luncheon on Capitol Hill Tuesday. But with President Donald Trump traveling in Asia and congressional leaders dug into their positions, a quick deal appeared unlikely.

Meanwhile, some rank-and-file lawmakers urged colleagues to consider the impact of their standoff on the lives of federal employees and Capitol police officers who have not been paid for weeks.

“We have got to come together, which means we’ve got to talk to one another,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a floor speech urging leaders to stop focusing on who was winning the political fight. “Right now, those that are losing are the American people.""

One particular claim had legs – that Republican residents were not getting the aid they needed because of their political affiliation.

An investigation that began under then-President Joe Biden and carried over into the Trump administration ultimately cleared the Federal Emergency Management Agency, finding no evidence of a systemic effort to deny aid based on politics while singling out one supervisor’s actions as illegal and improper.

But at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, leadership including Secretary Kristi Noem weren’t satisfied, three former senior FEMA officials told CNN. Within weeks, leaders ordered a new investigation that came to a much different conclusion.

Noem announced last week that the DHS probe found “for years, FEMA employees under the Biden Administration intentionally delayed much-needed aid to Americans suffering from natural disasters on purely political grounds.” She called it “textbook political discrimination” against Trump supporters.

The investigation looked at whether FEMA workers who went door-to-door in disaster zones recorded any protected private information about survivors’ political views. It found roughly 100 field reports — a small fraction out of tens of thousands of cases during the Biden administration — where FEMA workers visiting homes mentioned campaign signs or made notes related to “political beliefs.”

Investigators flagged a few instances where canvasser notes mentioned “Trump” or “Biden,” but in most cases, workers were documenting gun signage, which also was categorized as political. The report does not show that disaster survivors were denied aid because of these notations, and sources say the gun notations were often made for safety reasons.

Yet Noem portrayed the findings as proof of FEMA’s “widespread” and “systematic” bias and said she would refer the issue to the Justice Department for potential prosecution — her latest public attack on an agency she argues needs sweeping reforms or even abolition. Behind the scenes, insiders accuse DHS and Noem of stoking rumors and misinformation to help justify tearing FEMA down, as some argue it’s the Trump administration using disaster aid as a political weapon.

“They’ve been looking to prove that narrative any way they can, and to me, this is just a fabricated way of advancing it when really it’s not factually there,” said one of several FEMA officials who asked not to be named for fear of retribution.

“If we do something wrong, okay, hold us accountable,” the official added. “But don’t fabricate it because it meets your political narrative. That’s just bad government.”

Two hurricanes and a political firestorm

The political firestorm began last September after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Then-candidate Trump accused FEMA and the Biden administration of ignoring Republican areas and spending all its disaster aid on undocumented immigrants.

FEMA workers soon faced threats and hostility in disaster zones, and some teams were pulled from areas for safety. Weeks later, Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coast. FEMA teams, now stretched thin up and down the coast, reported widespread harassment fueled by Trump’s claims.

In late October, FEMA field supervisor Marn’i Washington delivered a now infamous directive to her 11 staffers deployed in Florida: “Avoid homes advertising Trump.”

Washington told CNN at the time that her supervisors had issued the orders, citing concerns about abuse from Trump supporters. However, the investigation later determined that no such directive was given; it was Washington’s own interpretation of how to protect her team.

FEMA leadership working under the Biden administration fired Washington and denounced her actions, deploying staff to the homes that may have been skipped. Then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell was called before Congress, where she condemned the directive as illegal and unacceptable, and said she’d already referred the case for further investigation.

“I stand by the testimony I provided to Congress under oath. When the initial incident came to light, I immediately took decisive action and addressed the situation,” Criswell told CNN in a statement last week. “I remain confident that we responded appropriately to the information we had.”

Still, Florida’s attorney general filed a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against FEMA and Criswell. To some, Washington’s actions were proof that Trump was right: FEMA is biased against Republicans.

An investigation clears FEMA

Over the next four months, FEMA’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel investigated the incident and broader agency culture – a probe that carried into Trump’s term.

Days after his inauguration, Trump visited western North Carolina and floated the idea of eliminating FEMA.

In March, Trump’s acting FEMA administrator, Cameron Hamilton, told lawmakers that three additional staffers had been fired in connection with the Washington incident, primarily for poor supervision or misleading investigators, two sources told CNN.

But Hamilton’s letter to Congress said investigators found “no evidence that this was a systemic problem, nor that it was directed by agency or field leadership.”

In fact, they found the opposite: that politics rarely came up in disaster zones.

“Tens of thousands of records were screened and reviewed. We found there was no reasonable evidence to authenticate a statement that denial of aid or assistance occurred based upon political bias from FEMA leadership,” Hamilton told CNN this week. “These isolated incidents were awful and a breach of public trust, however I did not see evidence that they were systemic across the agency. I say this as a lifelong Republican and supporter of President Trump.”

The probe formally cleared Criswell and FEMA in April, and Florida settled its lawsuit with no damages paid.

At the time, agency leaders believed the case was closed and perhaps the findings would ease the anti-FEMA rhetoric from Trump and Noem. They were wrong.

A second look at FEMA wrongdoing

Roman Jankowski, the newly appointed head of DHS’s Privacy Office and an alum of the Heritage Foundation, launched a separate review weeks after the internal probe concluded and requested the data investigators had relied on, multiple sources said.

Jankowski took a different approach, focusing on whether FEMA aid workers violated privacy laws by recording protected information — such as political beliefs — and whether that information could have been used to withhold disaster aid for political reasons. His review went beyond the initial investigation, which focused solely on the 2024 hurricane season, and examined data from the entirety of Biden’s four years in office.

“He definitely made it clear that he suspected FEMA was involved in broad-scale wrongdoing,” said a senior FEMA official who spoke directly to Jankowski about the review. “You could tell he had already arrived at a conclusion that FEMA as an agency needed to be severely punished, which was evident in his tone and language.”

Jankowski’s team released its report last week.

The 22-page report concludes FEMA canvassers going door-to-door repeatedly violated – or may have violated – privacy laws by collecting information on survivors’ political beliefs, and in a handful of cases, bypassed certain homes based on the details they noted.

But more than a dozen current and former FEMA officials argue that the evidence does not support claims of a systemic problem. They point out canvassers referenced Trump just 15 times in their reports, and it remains unclear whether workers never returned to those homes.

“I’m not a statistician, but when you’re looking at four years of data across tens of thousands of damaged homes, it doesn’t seem significant,” former FEMA chief of staff Michael Coen, who served under the Biden and Obama administrations, told CNN. “It doesn’t demonstrate that people were discriminated against in a systematic way.”

FEMA officials say these freeform notes are primarily used to alert colleagues about field conditions, especially for safety, and were not surprised that most of the so-called “partisan” notes referenced gun signage.

After Hurricane Helene, those safety worries reached a fever pitch. Trump’s relentless attacks on FEMA had sparked a wave of threats against the teams trying to help survivors in North Carolina, leaving workers on edge.

“We were hearing that guys in trucks with guns were out looking for FEMA employees, and the teams were freaked out,” a former senior official deployed to North Carolina said. “Let’s have common sense. FEMA employees are not law enforcement officers. They’re not walking around with bulletproof vests. This idea that they’re just going to run into harm’s way to register somebody is ridiculous.”

The report points to a few specific entries from canvassers who allegedly skipped homes, such as: “Survivor very anti govt anti Biden. Told me to tell Biden to go [f***] himself” and “…a lot of explicit political flags, posters, etc. ‘F*** Joe Biden’ ‘MAGA 2024’ ‘Joe Biden Sucks’ ‘Trump 2024.’ We do not recommend anyone visiting this location.”

DHS raised concerns that such notes likely led FEMA teams not to return to the homes.

But Noem has been more definitive in her claims about what the investigation found, saying the probe found “FEMA employees systematically refused to visit the houses of disaster survivors that displayed signs and flags they disagreed with, including those with campaign signs supporting President Trump.”

Trump’s FEMA ended door-to-door canvassing earlier this year, largely because of safety concerns and the fact that most survivors now apply for FEMA assistance online or through call centers, not through canvassers.

Several current and former senior FEMA officials acknowledged that some canvassers may have violated privacy laws and agreed that reviewing those cases would be appropriate. However, they cautioned that using this as evidence of an agencywide systemic effort to deny aid based on politics is unfounded.

“Whether or not there was bias in note taking, that’s a highly subjective analysis, but we didn’t find it to be sufficient to conclude wide-spread impact,” Hamilton said this week of the first internal investigation.

The next phase of Trump’s war on FEMA

As Noem paints the agency as partisan and inept, the new FEMA Review Council is set to present recommendations for reforms in the coming weeks. Trump has vowed to start phasing out FEMA after hurricane season, though he hasn’t detailed what that will entail.

From the outset, Noem positioned herself as Trump’s point person to fulfill his promise to dismantle FEMA. She now says the goal is to eliminate FEMA “as it exists today,” and she’s made clear that “cleaning house” and asserting control are central to that process.

“She’s trying to drive this narrative of how woke, terrible and unaccountable FEMA is, which is why they need to abolish it,” one former top official said.

Meanwhile, current and former FEMA officials say her attacks continue to erode public trust in the agency responsible for helping disaster survivors in their most vulnerable moments.

“It’s dangerous,” said Coen, the former FEMA chief of staff. “The faith in FEMA has declined. When people lose their trust in the federal government in a time of need, they’re going to feel more helpless.”

Some FEMA officials note the irony of these accusations, as Trump himself faces criticism for politicizing disaster aid — repeatedly posting on Truth Social about sending millions to states that supported him.

Last week, Trump announced $2.5 million for Missouri after speaking with its Republican governor, despite FEMA recommending denial because the damage was below the agency’s threshold for federal aid to be distributed.

“That request was dead and buried in our minds,” a senior FEMA official involved in the process told CNN. “Our damage assessments didn’t seem to indicate the recovery was beyond the State’s capacity. And believe me, we’re generally eager to help our state partners when it’s warranted.”

The Trump administration had previously fast-tracked FEMA money to Missouri while emergency funds for other states remained frozen.

In contrast, Democratic-led states like Maryland and Washington have been denied disaster aid by the president, even when their damage far exceeded FEMA’s threshold and approval was recommended.

Noem has ramped up her rhetoric in recent months.

Last month, she issued a press release announcing the firing of a FEMA staffer and an agency contractor for viewing sexually explicit content on government devices.

“We are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” she wrote at the time.

Since pledging to dismantle FEMA at the start of the administration, DHS leaders have subjected staff to polygraph tests, publicly fired employees, and placed dozens on administrative leave without warning or explanation. More than a quarter of FEMA’s full-time workforce has left through layoffs and buyouts, including dozens of senior leaders.

Behind the scenes, DHS has consolidated power at FEMA, filling leadership roles with political appointees and pushing out career experts who helped shape disaster response and recovery.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/04-gettyimages-2176731070.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-29 11:19:09.483826

But during the Trump administration, Border Patrol agents have been taking part in immigration enforcement operations around the country, far from their more traditional duties.","One current official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, said 12 ICE field office directors were being reassigned.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is reassigning at least half the top leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices around the country in a major shake-up of the agency responsible for carrying out the president’s vision for mass deportations, according to one current and one former U.S. government official.

The current official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, said 12 ICE field office directors — the officers who run the network of field offices around the country responsible for immigration enforcement — were being reassigned.

Half are to be replaced by existing or retired Customs and Border Protection staff, while the other half would be replaced by ICE officers, both the current and former officials said. The changes were initiated by the Homeland Security Department, the current official said, without specifying which cities were impacted.

The former official, who has direct knowledge of the changes and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information that was not intended for public release, said on top of the 12 reassignments, leaders in another four cities were being swapped out through retirements or other circumstances. He said the cities include major immigration enforcement targets such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington.

He added that ICE leadership has been discussing the changes with other Trump administration officials for some time as part of a broad review of the agency.

The reason for the personnel changes wasn’t immediately clear. But they indicate a greater integration of Border Patrol agents in ICE at a time when Customs and Border Protection has been accused of using heavy-handed tactics in its immigration enforcement.

With a total of 25 field offices around the country, the reassignments amount to turnover of about half or more of the top staffers carrying out the president’s hardline immigration enforcement plans, which has seen a major deployment of law enforcement in major American cities, thousands of arrests and surging fear among residents, especially in immigrant communities.

Homeland Security and the White House did not comment on the reassignments and each instead highlighted that all elements of immigration enforcement were working as one team.

Putting Customs and Border Protection officers into top positions within Immigration and Customs Enforcement would create an expanded role for an agency that is already at the forefront of many of the aggressive tactics seen in both Los Angeles and now in Chicago.

CBP officers — specifically Border Patrol agents — have carried out some of the most controversial operations as part of immigration crackdowns in both of those cities, including a recent raid in Chicago where officers rappelled down onto a building in an apartment complex from a helicopter. Border Patrol agents have also popped out of a moving truck and chased after people and conducted patrols through downtown Chicago.

Border Patrol agents protect the land and water between the official border crossings to prevent human trafficking, drug smuggling or other types of contraband from entering the U.S. ICE, since its creation in 2003, is the main agency responsible for immigration enforcement inside the country.

But during the Trump administration, Border Patrol agents have been taking part in immigration enforcement operations around the country, far from their more traditional duties.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol sector chief from California who has been heading the Border Patrol’s operations in both cities, is himself accused of throwing tear gas canisters at protesters and took the stand Tuesday as a defendant in a federal lawsuit about whether federal officials are using excessive force in Chicago.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement says its agents carry out “targeted enforcement operations,” which often involve hours of time staking out people they’re trying to remove from the country.

This is the third shake-up at ICE since Trump took office, reflecting the importance of the agency’s role in executing the president’s vision.

In February, Homeland Security reassigned Caleb Vitello, the acting director of ICE, to another position. Todd Lyons, a veteran ICE agent, was later announced as the new acting head of the agency, a position he still holds.

Then in May, ICE announced the reassignment of the two top officials heading the agency’s main branches.

A spokesperson for Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, did not comment Tuesday on the personnel changes but said in a statement that the department remained “laser focused on RESULTS and we will deliver.”

“This is one team, one fight,” she said. “President (Donald) Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary (Kristi) Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an e-mailed statement: “The President’s entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President’s policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.”

Differing views of agriculture labor source The labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, said during a June speech the H-2A program will help solve farmers’ labor concerns, according to The Packer.
While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.","This story is is supported by funding from the Chicago Region Food Systems Fund.

President Trump’s deportation of more than half a million people, along with his ending of several programs that allowed immigrants to work in the country legally, has created labor issues across the agriculture sector, including for farmers, an important political constituency.

While experts warned mass deportation would result in agricultural labor shortages, which could then lead to food shortages, Trump officials predicted U.S.-born workers would happily fill those vacant jobs. So far, that hasn’t happened.

There has also been a lack of movement by the Trump administration and his congressional allies toward creating a viable, long-term solution for the immigration system.

Corporate agriculture has often pursued lax safety standards, few labor protections and low wages. In many cases, only immigrants and undocumented workers are willing to toil long hours in extremely hot fields and to cut animal carcasses in hazardous meatpacking plants.

In recent months, to increase the number of farmworkers in the country, the administration has tinkered with the H-2A visa program, which allows some agricultural employers to hire foreign nationals for months at a time. The administration said it has streamlined the process to apply to bring workers to the U.S., and it’s trying to allow farmers to pay foreign visa workers less.

But full-scale reforms — the kind industry groups say are necessary — have not yet materialized, even as the administration ramps up immigration enforcement. Also, some agricultural industries, such as dairy, are not eligible to hire through the program.

“The H-2A program is not the sustainable solution, but it is a short-term solution,” said John Walt Boatright, the director of government affairs at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farmer advocacy group. “I do foresee the H-2A program continuing to increase in use, but by no means is that a measure of its popularity.”

While the Trump administration is relying on the H-2A program to help a vital voting bloc, its approach to government funding has also created problems for those who need it.

As Trump and his congressional allies battled over federal funding with Democrats, the government shut down Oct. 1. That day, the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the H-2A program, said a funding lapse resulted in the program’s suspension.

“A prolonged lapse of funding,” the labor department stated in a notice, “will exacerbate processing delays … especially” for the H-2A program.

In mid-October, more than two weeks into the shutdown, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins saying the delays “imminently threaten agricultural production,” according to Civil Eats. The association did not respond to a request for comment.

While farmers are dealing with roadblocks to one labor source, the Trump administration continues to crack down on another.

Out of about 2 million farmworkers in the U.S., government surveys show about 44% are undocumented. Hundreds of thousands of others in the food supply chain — meatpacking plants, grocery stores, restaurants — are also undocumented.

Trump’s policies have also created more undocumented immigrants in the country. He ended humanitarian parole programs that allowed immigrants escaping unsafe environments to work in the U.S. The move left some meatpacking plants without a reliable labor pool.

Immigration raids, or the threat of them, have led to worker shortages across the country. In Pennsylvania, some dairy farmers, who often have to rely on undocumented laborers, have sold off their herds because they could not find any interested workers, according to Politico. In California this summer, some fields were not harvested because many workers stayed home, according to Reuters. In Idaho, similar concerns pervade farm country.

It’s difficult to know exactly how many undocumented farmworkers have left the labor force, but the country has seen a decline in immigrant workers overall. About 750,000 immigrants have left the labor force since January, the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, estimated in August. The decline in the immigrant workforce is likely to reduce the overall labor force, which could harm the country’s economy, according to CNBC.

The cumulative effect of the Trump administration’s actions will likely lead to fewer small farms and a trend toward larger industrial-sized farms, which will have the ability to access visa workes and explore options for mechanization, said Mary Jo Dudley, former director of the Cornell Farmworker Program and current director of Migrant Advocacy and Support.

“As more people are detained, farms are going to lose workers,” she said. “Dairy producers who don’t have access to H-2A workers are faced with hard decisions: Should they just sell their cows if their workers are going to disappear any day? The possibilities for small family farms are quickly slipping away.”

Despite farmer concerns, immigration raids continue

For months, Trump has said a solution is in the works. During a July 4 speech, he said, “We have some great stuff being written.”

However, Trump’s main goal and the platform he ran on — mass deportation — has always taken precedence.

Over the summer, Rollins pushed Trump to pause enforcement on farms, citing farmers’ concerns, according to the New York Times. A few days later, raids resumed. Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide, has told the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the home of ICE, it needs to arrest 3,000 people a day, according to Axios.

In mid-September, Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, told local TV station WWNY that “there are discussions going on now” about raids affecting farm labor. But he made clear the increased enforcement would continue.

“President has said there won’t be amnesty,” Homan said. “But he is looking at options for farms.”

The labor department did not respond to a request for comment on the statement in the proposed rule. When a spokeswoman was contacted via email, she said she’d have to wait to respond until the government shutdown was over.

Differing views of agriculture labor source

The labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, said during a June speech the H-2A program will help solve farmers’ labor concerns, according to The Packer.

“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” she said over the summer to the Western Governors Association. “I can just tell you, none of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Her comment stands in contrast to other Trump officials, who have consistently said the objective is to replace immigrant farmworkers with U.S.-born workers. About two weeks after Chavez-DeRemer’s comments, Rollins contradicted her.

With Congress in recess, no deliberation on possible labor solutions

The agriculture committee in the U.S. House of Representatives has studied the H-2A program, and last year it offered a template for reforms.

Currently, employers — or specialty firms that employers hire — must file paperwork with three federal departments to bring foreign farmworkers to the U.S. The committee recommended creating a single portal for employers to use. It also suggested lowering how much employers spend on wages and housing.

This summer, a bill was introduced based on the template, but it has not received a committee hearing.

The House has not convened since Sept. 19, and it’s unclear when it will resume. U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and the body’s speaker, has faced criticism from his own party for the long delay, according to The Hill. While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.

With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress and the White House, Investigate Midwest contacted all 30 Republicans on the House agriculture committee to understand their perspective on how the shutdown is affecting a possible labor solution for farmers hurt by increased immigration enforcement.

However, most did not respond, and a few said they would not comment. The chair of the agriculture committee, Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

DOL creates new office, unclear if old issues addressed

The Trump administration has sought to curtail other visas and legal statuses in its effort to severely limit the number of immigrants in the country, but it has backed expanding the H-2A program, which is only for agricultural employers.

In addition to ending humanitarian parole programs, the administration has proposed requiring employers who hire through the H-1B program to pay a $100,000 fee per application. H-1B holders are considered “highly skilled” immigrants who work in high-paying industries, such as tech. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued over the fee.

On the other hand, H-2A farmworkers are typically paid slightly more than minimum wage for jobs that don’t last long, and wage theft is a well-documented problem.

The Trump administration could be attempting to replace many undocumented farmworkers with foreigners who spend just months at a time in the U.S., said Daniel Costa, a lead immigration researcher at the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute.

“Basically, they’re saying, ‘We want workers, but we don’t want people,’” he said.

This summer, the DOL created a new office it said would help increase the number of farmers participating in the H-2A program. However, it’s unclear how the office is addressing issues created by the program’s popularity.

During the June speech to governors of western states, Chavez-DeRemer, the labor secretary, said she was creating a “one-stop shop” for the H-2A program. The new office would help address a backlog of applications, as well as speed up approvals for farmers who need workers quickly, she said, according to The Packer.

“We’re finally going to lean in,” she said, “and then we’ll work with Congress on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

The new office, named the Office of Immigration Policy, will set “strategic oversight,” “strategic management” and “strategic priority” for visa programs, according to Chavez-DeRemer’s memo.

The man tapped to run the office, Brian Pasternak, has worked as a civil servant at the labor department for more than 20 years. Most recently, he oversaw the Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which processes and approves H-2A visa applications submitted by employers.

Even before the current shutdown, the labor certification office struggled to keep pace with the increasingly high demand for H-2A workers, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office report.

Staff members were shifted from their regular responsibilities to processing H-2A applications, which led to longer processing times for other visas. As the number of applications increased, regulators also dinged employers for fewer infractions, such as lacking proof of adequate housing, a longtime problem for farmworkers on visas.

Having enough staff was an issue before Trump assumed office, and it’s unclear if staffing cuts by Elon Musk’s DOGE affected the processing of H-2A applications.

The labor department lost about 1% of its workforce in DOGE’s initial purge, according to The New York Times, and more cuts could be coming during the government shutdown.

The labor department did not respond to a question about how many staffers handling H-2A applications were fired or took early retirement since January. It also did not respond when asked how it plans to handle the issues the Government Accountability Office identified.

The new office “will support President Trump’s efforts to prevent illegal immigration by helping employers access and navigate these programs – supporting legal pathways to work,” said Courtney Parella, a labor department spokeswoman. “By establishing the (Office of Immigration Policy), which reports directly to the Secretary, the Department is cutting red tape and streamlining its ability to execute immigration-related policy priorities and administer foreign labor certification programs.”

Boatright, with the American Farm Bureau, said the labor department’s new office holds a lot of promise. However, at least so far, little has changed on the ground.

“No news yet,” he said, “but we’re anxious to see what this Office of Immigration Policy can do.”

She said she was scared, ""Maybe they were impersonating? Or, getting kidnapped and not seeing my family again?""

Can a new state law prevent that?,Claudia Boyd-Barrett,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-29/california-health-facilities-immigration-raids-pushback,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also have shown up at community clinics.
In response to such immigration enforcement activity in and around clinics and hospitals, Gov.
Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare.
Mangia said St. John’s staff had two encounters with immigration agents over the summer.
Another occurred in July, when immigration agents descended upon MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles, in a show of force by the Trump administration.","In recent months, federal agents camped out in the lobby of a Southern California hospital, guarded detained patients — sometimes shackled — in hospital rooms, and chased an immigrant landscaper into a surgical center.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also have shown up at community clinics. Health providers say officers tried to enter a parking lot hosting a mobile clinic, waved a machine gun in the faces of clinicians serving the homeless, and hauled a passerby into an unmarked car outside a community health center.

In response to such immigration enforcement activity in and around clinics and hospitals, Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed SB 81, which prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters.

But while the bill received broad support from medical groups, health care workers and immigrant rights advocates, legal experts say California can’t stop federal authorities from carrying out duties in public places like hospital lobbies and general waiting areas, parking lots and surrounding neighborhoods — places where recent ICE activities sparked outrage and fear. Previous federal restrictions on immigration enforcement in or near sensitive areas, including health care establishments, were rescinded by the Trump administration in January.

“The issue that states encounter is the supremacy clause,” said Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law. She said the federal government has the right to conduct enforcement activities, and there are limits to what the state can do to stop them.

California’s law designates a patient’s immigration status and birthplace as protected information, which like medical records cannot be disclosed to law enforcement without a warrant or court order. And it requires health care facilities to have clear procedures for handling requests from immigration authorities, including training staff to immediately notify a designated administrator or legal counsel if agents ask to enter a private area or review patient records.

Several other Democratic-led states also have taken up legislation to protect patients at hospitals and health centers. In May, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Protect Civil Rights Immigration Status bill, which penalizes hospitals for unauthorized sharing of information about people in the country illegally and bars ICE agents from entering private areas of health care facilities without a judicial warrant. In Maryland, a law requiring the attorney general to create guidance on keeping ICE out of health care facilities went into effect in June. New Mexico instituted new patient data protections, and Rhode Island prohibited health care facilities from asking patients about their immigration status.

Republican-led states have aligned with federal efforts to prevent health care spending on immigrants without legal authorization. Such immigrants are not eligible for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, but states do bill the federal government for emergency care in certain cases. Under a law that took effect in 2023, Florida requires hospitals that accept Medicaid to ask about a patient’s legal status. In Texas, hospitals now have to report how much they spend on care for immigrants without legal authorization.

“Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in issuing his executive order last year.

California’s efforts to rein in federal enforcement come as the state, where more than a quarter of residents are foreign-born, has become a target of President Trump’s immigration crackdown. Newsom signed SB 81 as part of a bill package prohibiting immigration agents from entering schools without a warrant, requiring law enforcement officers to identify themselves, and banning officers from wearing masks. SB 81 was passed on a party-line vote with no formal opposition.

“We’re not North Korea,” Newsom said during a September bill-signing ceremony. “We’re pushing back against these authoritarian tendencies and actions of this administration.”

Some supporters of the bill and legal experts said California’s law can prevent ICE from violating existing patient privacy rights. Those include the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits searches without a warrant in places where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Valid warrants must be issued by a court and signed by a judge. But ICE agents frequently use administrative warrants to try to gain access to private areas they don’t have the authority to enter, Genovese said.

“People don’t always understand the difference between an administrative warrant, which is a meaningless piece of paper, versus a judicial warrant that is enforceable,” Genovese said. Judicial warrants are rarely issued in immigration cases, she added.

The Department of Homeland Security said it won’t abide by California’s mask ban or identification requirements for law enforcement officers, slamming them as unconstitutional. The department did not respond to a request for comment on the state’s new rules for health care facilities, which went into immediate effect.

Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare. But the federal decision to rescind protections around sensitive areas, she said, “has generated fear and uncertainty across the country.” Many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have been in California, largely involving detained patients brought in for care.

The California Nurses Assn., the state’s largest nurses union, was a co-sponsor of the bill and raised concerns about the treatment of Milagro Solis-Portillo, a 36-year-old Salvadoran woman who was under round-the-clock ICE surveillance at Glendale Memorial Hospital over the summer.

Union leaders also condemned the presence of agents at California Hospital Medical Center south of downtown Los Angeles. According to Anne Caputo-Pearl, a labor and delivery nurse and the chief union representative at the hospital, agents brought in a patient on Oct. 21 and remained in the patient’s room for almost a week. The Los Angeles Times reported that a TikTok streamer, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, was taken to the hospital that day after he was wounded during an immigration enforcement operation in South Los Angeles.

The presence of ICE was intimidating for nurses and patients, Caputo-Pearl said, and prompted visitor restrictions at the hospital. “We want better clarification,” she said. “Why is it that these agents are allowed to be in the room?”

Hospital and clinic representatives, however, said they already are following the law’s requirements, which largely reinforce extensive guidance put out by state Attorney General Rob Bonta in December.

Community clinics throughout Los Angeles County, which serve more than 2 million patients a year, including a large portion of immigrants, have been implementing the attorney general’s guidelines for months, said Louise McCarthy, president and chief executive of the Community Clinic Assn. of Los Angeles County. She said the law should help ensure uniform standards across health facilities that clinics refer out to and reassure patients that procedures are in place to protect them.

Still, it can’t prevent immigration raids from happening in the broader community, which have made some patients and even health workers afraid to venture outside, McCarthy said. Some incidents have occurred near clinics, including an arrest of a passerby outside a clinic in East Los Angeles, which a security guard caught on video, she said.

“We’ve had clinic staff say, ‘Is it safe for me to go out?’” she said.

At St. John’s Community Health, a network of 24 community health centers and five mobile clinics in South Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, chief executive Jim Mangia agreed the new law can’t prevent all immigration enforcement activity, but said it gives clinics a tool to push back with if agents show up, something his staff has had to do.

Mangia said St. John’s staff had two encounters with immigration agents over the summer. In one, he said, staff stopped armed officers from entering a gated parking lot at a drug and alcohol recovery center where doctors and nurses were seeing patients at a mobile health clinic.

Another occurred in July, when immigration agents descended upon MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles, in a show of force by the Trump administration. Mangia said masked officers in full tactical gear surrounded a street medicine tent where St. John’s providers were tending to homeless patients, screamed at staff to get out and pointed a gun at them. The providers were so shaken by the episode, Mangia said, that he had to bring in mental health professionals to help them feel safe going back out on the street.

A DHS spokesperson told CalMatters that in the rare instance when agents enter certain sensitive locations, officers would need “secondary supervisor approval.”

Since then, St. John’s doubled down on providing support and training to staff and offered patients afraid to go out the option of home medical visits and grocery deliveries. Patient fears and ICE activity have decreased since the summer, Mangia said, but with DHS planning to hire an additional 10,000 ICE agents, he doubts that will last.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1811c06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3272+0+348/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe9%2F4a%2Fa3fcfde046efb99213f4d148f7ee%2F1513307-me-ice-macarthur-park07a-cs.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 10:17:04.327191

Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, both Democrats.","A federal judge disqualified the United States Attorney in Los Angeles on Tuesday, the latest rebuke to the Trump administration’s attempts to circumvent congressional approval for federal prosecutors.

The ruling creates leadership uncertainty in the nation’s largest judicial district, the Central District of California, which serves seven counties in the Los Angeles area. The order was issued by Judge J. Michael Seabright of the Federal District Court in Hawaii, who ruled that the Trump appointee, Bill Essayli, “is not lawfully serving as acting United States Attorney” and “cannot continue to perform any role” that job entails.

But it was unclear what the practical effect of his order would be, since the judge also allowed Mr. Essayli to revert to the role of the office’s top deputy, as the first assistant United States attorney.

The judge, an appointee of George W. Bush, said he shared concerns expressed by lawyers who had challenged Mr. Essayli’s status that the result was “little remedy at all” and agreed that the Department of Justice was effectively circumventing the intent of the law. But he said he was constrained “to apply the statutes as written.”

The judge also did not dismiss the three criminal cases being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney’s office in which defense lawyers had argued that Mr. Essayli lacked legal standing to prosecute. And while Mr. Essayli could not supervise the cases as the head of the office, the judge ruled, he could supervise them as the office’s top deputy.

A spokesman for Mr. Essayli could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Trump administration’s strategy of forgoing congressional approval has clouded the legitimacy of several prominent regional offices of the Department of Justice. Three federal judges have now rejected attempts by the administration to retain federal prosecutors on an “acting” basis, without Senate or judicial confirmation, after their initial 120-day terms expired. A fourth challenge was brought last week by James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, who has asserted in court filings that Lindsey Halligan, a prosecutor Mr. Trump put in place in Virginia, was improperly appointed.

And California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office confirmed on Tuesday that the governor had hired one of the federal prosecutors purged by the Trump administration, Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento.

Last month, a federal judge disqualified Nevada’s top federal prosecutor, Sigal Chattah, from handling four cases, saying that she was “not validly serving as acting U.S. attorney” and that her involvement in cases “would be unlawful.” Challenges have since arisen in other federal cases brought in that state. In August, a different judge ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Mr. Trump, had been serving as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney without legal authority. Both decisions have been appealed.

Mr. Essayli and Ms. Chattah had initially been appointed “interim” U.S. attorneys. Interim appointments expire after 120 days, but in late July, the Trump administration extended their terms by naming them both acting U.S. attorneys. Permanent U.S. attorney appointments typically require approval either by the U.S. Senate or by federal judges in the affected district.

In a hearing on Mr. Essayli’s situation in Los Angeles earlier this month, lawyers debated the fine points of laws dictating the rules for appointments, which are not always straightforward. Alexander Robbins, an assistant U.S. attorney, argued that “it’s pretty clear that Mr. Essayli legitimately works here, like I do and like all the other A.U.S.A.s in this office.”

Public defenders in Nevada and California have led the challenges but have not discussed them publicly. But they have been joined by other lawyers who have.

“They are trying to get around congressional oversight,” Mark Windsor, one of the private lawyers challenging Mr. Essayli’s appointment on behalf of a client, said during the hearing in Los Angeles. “I don’t think that this court can avoid the conclusion that this really is an intentional, knowing, deliberate attempt to circumvent some of the key safeguards within our Constitution and that it deserves the most extreme remedy that this court can fashion in order to deter that conduct,” he added.

The case is likely to be appealed along with the others. In remarks during the court hearing, Judge Seabright said that “no matter what” he ruled, the case would inevitably end up before a higher court.

Mr. Essayli, a former state assemblyman who once worked as an assistant U.S. attorney, is a Trump ally who has been far more outspoken on political issues than have many of his predecessors. In social media posts, he has criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, both Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News, he said that many state lawmakers appeared to have “a disease in the mind” and “want soft-on-crime policies.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/28/multimedia/28nat-la-essayli-mlbj/28nat-la-essayli-mlbj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 12:02:14.310917

So for its a challenge, not just to the muscle commute, all faith communities.","Local faith leaders are speaking out on immigration enforcement, from churches to mosques.

Synagogues.

Many religious groups are taking to the streets to protest ramped up federal immigration action across the Chicago area.

Joining us to talk about these issues are Reverend Juan Vargas, associate pastor at our Lady of the Rosary Parish on Chicago's northwest side.

Rabbi Rachel Weiss from the Jewish Reconstructionist congregation in Evanston Romney national.

She be founder and executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network.

And Reverend Quincy were intent.

Pastor at the Highland Park Presbyterian Church.

Thanks to all of you for joining us for this discussion.

I want to get a sense from all of you.

So the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Midway Blitz began in September.

And since then, of course, we have all seen the video of ICE agents in Chicago neighborhoods, masked men pending people to the ground as state leaders.

What is your reaction when you see video like that in and around your communities?

Father, want start with you, please it, Tony source anger within myself and also I kind of feel with the congregation this last lost the pope.

>> I know even before that, just listening to parishioners with this fear that was just kind of boarding up at this point, like seen that it just really create a lot of tension and and, you know, within myself, it's just like how do we bring, you know, hope to this community?

How do we hope to people to be able to walking just just around the neighborhood and be able to their normal life.

>> It's unconscionable.

What's happening.

I think we are seeing the worst of what human beings are capable of doing being enacted in our streets in our communities amongst people that are neighbors, they're our friends, our co-workers, people who are important members of our community who are not even feeling safe to let their children walk home from school to do their jobs, cutting lawns or going into their their places of of employment.

And we are feeling how and what do we do and trying to find as many tangible ways that we can stand up.

We can speak out.

We can be there and we can help.

From an SUV.

>> It's been really a reign of terror and it's inflicted some of the most dramatic set of circumstances that will be with people for the rest of their lives.

We're talking about women that have been selling them honest and neighborhoods for 30 years.

We're talking about residents of the South side like in South Shore woman that lived entire life on the South side, never confronted any form of violence until ice age and put a gun in her face that's affecting everyday people.

King came to the Chicago over 60 years ago in neighborhoods that worked in London for the last 30 years to confront what he called evil that was inflicted upon the city at that time.

I think at this moment we need to as faith leaders and organizers call what we're seeing, what it is.

It's evil.

>> Strong words Reverend.

>> Yeah, I agree with everything everybody Definitely sense of shock and I'm hoping a righteous anger.

Quickly followed the question of what Christ have do and where would cry said a stand?

>> A rabbi, your synagogue in Evanston.

It's right next to where ICE has been active in Evanston, detaining people.

How are members of your congregation reacting?

Our candidates are showing up and saying what do I do?

They are getting whistles.

They are being trained.

They are coming into the streets.

They are standing across from Home Depot.

They're walking around the neighborhood, making sure that they are seeing what they can see and ready to call out.

They're also gathering together to at support one another.

We know so many families that don't have enough food right now that aren't able work or terrified to leave their houses.

And so our congregation collected over $5,000 in gift cards over our high holidays as a start to say, how do we give these to school social workers and ESL teachers?

How do we help a little bit makes something easier that we can in the face of so much destruction and so much of humanity photo and tell us about some of your because you said that members have asked for zoom option because they're scared to make the trip to church.

Yeah, it's been unfortunate where like?

>> mass attendance has been kind of regular.

You kind of see a little bit of a flow that goes up and down.

But not too dramatic.

But when it comes to light the day today, you know, religious education costs like that's where like I'm just scared of walking out with my child.

And so is there an option go back to what we had and we experienced of COVID, which is a sad and, you know, to know that the human encounters necessary, especially when our faith by fan just recognizing the dignity of others.

And so we've gone back to some of those classes and others have also given the opportunity car pulls, says like what we we take the same class, have always go together.

And I think you often so point so, that's it's been a very alarming to hear that from starting as soon mask just yet as the COVID days.

No, not yet.

One of the things is that we talked about it is just a calm at the end of the day since people are still coming.

But this is the one thing that's normal.

The one thing where they can calm and just kind of take a deep breath.

>> We don't know that's going to last for long.

You know, as you know, we've seen that there's been some ice presence in my parking lots churches and so forth.

So it's just being really careful with that.

But we can't lose that.

That strand of ensuring to give some are mallet, eat everything that's happening.

>> Revenue Bennett, the broad, detention center every week since September on.

In fact, you were standing just feet away from Reverend David Black out when he was pepper sprayed and hit with pepper.

What was that moment like?

>> Terrifying shocking.

again moment of righteous anger and it quickly shifted to find him if they're doing this to us broad daylight, they're doing this to clergy in front of cameras.

What in the world is going on inside detention center that has oversight.

And how are those people being treated?

Yeah, and we're looking at some of that video just now of that incident happening >> roaming we've seen students investigated or even detained for voicing support for Palestinians.

We have seen clergy pepper sprayed for protesting outside Broadview as we're discussing.

You've spent decades in interfaith activism.

What does it say to you that people who dissent, whether it is over Gaza or ISIS presence in our communities, that it's being met with this kind of state response one of our legendary organizers from the South side, Chicago Pentecostal preacher once used to say in our sermon who got next.

And I think right now what we as organizers and also rooted in faith like that one shun that I leave in a city with some action network.

The man knows that, you know, none of us are isolated from the types of tactics that we're seeing deployed, whether it's fathers in broad when the Ritz, you know, inside folks as homes and so one of the things that we know we need to do in this moment is find ways to connect together to stay together and to find ways to realize that there is no limits to the types of tactics that they're willing to deploy.

So there should be no limits in organizing tactics that were ready to use to bring hearts and communities and minds together that lean into the best of our traditions, especially in this moment.

>> To all of you, what do what is your, you know, your respective faiths, what they say about the persecution of in this case, immigrants and some will say all black and brown people.

But what is for one will come to you first.

What is your fate say about the persecution of humans of immigrants in this case?

>> it's just recognizing that people are just looking for, you know, play to survive.

And starfish just kind of says it's like how and your heart you becoming more Christ like and this can be both for the immigrant also for those that are persecuting following others like, how are you exemplifying what Christ taught us and what he came to do when you come to master, come to celebrate the Eucharist to come to.

He seemed Jesus Christ himself in at the end.

That's an invitation for conversion conversion.

Meaning you trying to glorify the road the best we can and it starts at home.

It starts with how do you provide to your family?

How do you do that?

And so even for the immigrant is how do you how do we get out of, you know, whatever difficulty or poor situation we're living in or violence and it's so it's again following the steps of Christ to be able to be safe and be able to live.

You know, just a life that can take you to that Santa to that we're all called to >> Judaism believes that every human being is created.

LaMelo.

which translates to in the image of the divine.

We don't know what looks like.

So God must look like us all.

And the idea that 36 times in the Tara, it says that you shall love the stranger, the immigrant, the person who has different among you.

And it is a deep part of our tradition to look back and say this has happened to us.

This has happened to other people.

It is our responsibility to recognize the good in human beings.

We believe that human beings are created.

Good.

And if we're all created essentially good at heart, then it's our responsibility to help uncover that good in others.

And the best way we can do that is in relationships with other people in thinking about how we use our Jewish traditions, too.

Both nourish and raise us up in this moment in ICE and immigration.

Jews aren't being targeted.

But yet, as you said, Robbie, I think who's next in this question of how do we with empathy?

And with quarter values and making relationships and reaching out to one another partner with each other each other's burdens and to really live the values that that we believe me.

>> Yeah.

In the in the tradition there's a prophetic, Heidi.

The tradition from the Prophet Muhammad peace blessings be that said none of you believe unless you want for your brother and sister, what you want for yourself.

And and the word here is none of you really have faith.

So for its a challenge, not just to the muscle commute, all faith communities.

If we don't put ourselves in the positions of one another and understand what does a family community that has been tending to people's lawns are sending bodies are working in anyone's neighborhood are working.

These fathers and mothers that have been working now coming home to a family that has been rent asunder and living in this extraordinary moment of trauma.

How do we connect to that?

And like you said earlier, none of us in this moment.

Free from Even if you espouse basic human dignity for Palestinians are whether you're standing with your Latino neighbors or whether you're standing with you right for African-American, black and brown communities that have been traumatized.

This is a moment that challenges our core expression of faith.

And I believe it's a challenge, but it's also an opportunity to stand up and exemplify what real faith looks like.

Reverend.

Yeah, I got my reading of scripture leads me to believe that God is preferential treatment to the poor the marginalized and the oppressed.

>> And we see Jesus talking prophetically teaching prophetically in living prophetically that we need to stand with those people and make sure that they know that they loved by God and that God's grace extends to them.

And one of the things that we see Jesus condemning people for are people like me in this country are privileged just by the nature of my skin.

My ethnicity, my gender, my sexuality Jesus condemns people in my position who do not use that privilege to stand up for the people who can't stand by themselves and I can't speak for themselves.

And so for me, it's it's a matter of if the gospel is going to claim supreme in my life.

Then I have to take the teachings of Jesus very seriously.

Which means that I to the to use my privilege.

To show preferential treatment to the press, the marginalized and the outcast.

All of that said, do you feel like you've heard our national and federal leaders in power?

>> Hughes get basically Christian nationalism to justify their actions.

>> Yeah, they have.

And I think the use scripture that that they've utilized has been nothing short of an affront to the Gospel, plain and simple.

I think it's important and it's one of the most offensive uses of scripture to to use it too dominate in dehumanize people is the antithesis of the teachings of Christ.

And so I think we need to take of a very hard look at ourselves as faith leaders and make sure that we speak out very loudly very clearly and very plainly it it's an important piece of scripture.

>> Rabbi, for many in Jewish community, there is a collective memory of soldiers patrolling the streets in Europe.

When you see masked men detaining men and women and sometimes children and American neighborhoods today.

Does that history?

Does that come to mind for Absolutely.

I've had congregants say to me, this feels like Germany, 1938, when my grandparents are my parents where terrified to leave their houses.

And at the same time, we also look at the history that says, look who came out and supported us.

Look who came out to say this is wrong.

We have to stop this and who spoke up.

And that's really what we're trying to embody to say that Judaism doesn't say, well, this happened to us.

So we survived it.

And now we're done.

It says in every generation you have to tell the story of the exodus as though you lived it yourself and you're still living yourself to remind ourselves that well, we might have a level of privilege is most of us in our congregation are white and middle class.

But our neighbors don't.

And so it's our obligation to say how do we, as you said, use that privilege.

How do we stand up and make sure that we're surrounding and a company?

Father?

Juan, you join Eucharistic procession to the Broad View Detention center a few weeks ago.

You what we're hoping you all were hoping to hold a service for those on the inside.

We will out now.

So we were denied There was congregation about 7 that we're going to try and distribute communion inside.

>> That was denied.

So now we're going to try to get November first on Saturday will be having a mask outside about the detention center and another group will also be trying to attempt to go inside.

And so to be able to distribute hope, not just communion to those that can receive but also hope to the rest that are there.

>> Revenue warning to the national detention standards requires that people in ICE custody be allowed to practice their faith and have adequate space for religious activities.

And it sounds from when also from what you've seen and heard that what or is that being allowed and what's the impact of not being able to observe your faith even though in detention?

No, it's Monday night.

Every there have been at least 3 or 4 efforts.

I think.

>> Just in the past month to try and get communion or religious services into them.

Obviously.

>> Might Roman Catholic brothers and sisters?

I think at the biggest push and I'm excited for you all to be there on Saturday.

I think it's wonderful.

>> To >> deny people access to, to be able to practice their faith.

back.

>> I don't even know what to say about it.

It's just it's we've been using the word of Horton unconscionable lot here in that.

It fits right in with I think especially people who are captive.

And separated from their families and their future so uncertain.

I mean, that's when they need to know God's presence among us.

And that's when they need to feel God's grace.

The most it in my tradition, it which isn't Roman Catholic, unfortunate and Presbyterian.

We believe that communion don't break are you know?

looking to get we believe that Communion is essentially steroid injection of grace into the community.

>> Right.

And so you're denying people grace, you're denying people the comfort of the Holy Spirit I mean, it.

That alone is a basic human rights violation.

Let alone the denial of a basic bands.

I mean, you 150 men crammed into a room together.

So it sounds like the 4th you have your work cut out for you thank you for joining us.

That's where we'll have to leave it.",https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/Gpz16Yq-asset-mezzanine-16x9-2IOczWm.jpg?focalcrop=1200x630x50x10&format=auto,N,,2025-10-29 10:17:08.730467

Khathavong contributed to one of Philadelphia’s most shocking and senseless acts of violence — the 1994 death of Philadelphia high school student Eddie Polec, who was murdered on the steps of a local church.

“We sincerely hope that the removal of Bou Khathavong can finally help the family of Eddie Polec and the city of Philadelphia heal from one of the most horrifying crimes in Philadelphia’s history,” said ICE ERO Philadelphia acting Field Office Director David O’Neill. “ICE is working daily to safeguard the American public and bring justice for the families of those who are harmed by illegal aliens.”

Khathavong legally entered the United States from Laos on June 23, 1980.

On Nov. 11, 1994, Khathavong was arrested by the Philadelphia Police Department for his role in the brutal murder of Polec, 16, who was savagely beaten to death by a mob of suburban teenagers in the Fox Chase neighborhood of Philadelphia.

The brutal murder horrified the community and made national headlines. Khathavong was charged with two counts of murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and criminal conspiracy.

Reporting at the time recounted how the victim was mercilessly beaten with baseball bats and other weapons while lying defenseless on the steps of a church. Despite desperate calls for help, the attack continued until Polec succumbed to his injuries.

On March 19, 1996, Khathavong was convicted of criminal conspiracy and sentenced to a minimum of five years and a maximum of ten years in prison.

On Feb. 14, 1996, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service lodged an immigration detainer against Khathavong at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia.

While policymakers have described parental notification as less onerous than parental consent laws, parental notification laws effectively grant parents—or a judge—veto power over a young person’s abortion decision.

Lawmakers in states with parental notification laws should repeal these laws and affirm young people’s rights to make fundamental decisions about their bodies and lives.

(New York) – State laws requiring healthcare providers to notify a parent about a young person’s abortion decision cause harmful delays and can block access to abortion, Human Rights Watch and If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice said in a report released today. As access to abortion in the United States continues to deteriorate, young people face additional hurdles to receiving care.

The 89-page report, “Whose Abortion Is It? The Harms of State-Mandated Parental Notification for Abortion and Judicial Bypass in the United States,” documents how state-mandated parental notification laws in six US states threaten young people’s health and safety and undermine their human rights. Most young people considering abortion involve a parent in their decision. Those who do not often have no access to a parent or fear that parental involvement will lead to severe consequences, such as physical abuse, loss of housing, family alienation, or forced continuation of a pregnancy against their wishes. The alternative to notifying a parent involves petitioning a judge for a court order in an invasive, stressful, and often traumatizing process called “judicial bypass.”

“Young people should be able to access abortion care without being forced to involve an unsupportive parent or appear before a judge in court,” said Margaret Wurth, senior children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch and a co-author of the report. “State lawmakers committed to reproductive freedom should defend young people’s health, safety, and dignity by repealing parental notification for abortion laws.”

Currently, 25 US states where abortion is legal at some point in pregnancy require a healthcare provider to notify or obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian before providing abortion care to anyone under 18. While policymakers have described parental notification for abortion laws as less onerous than parental consent laws, Human Rights Watch and If/When/How found that parental notification laws effectively grant parents—or a judge—veto power over a young person’s abortion decision.

The researchers found that judicial bypass delays care, endangers young people, and can present an insurmountable barrier for some.

Researchers interviewed 62 healthcare providers, attorneys experienced in representing youth in judicial bypass cases, people working for abortion funds (organizations offering support to those seeking care), advocates, and public health researchers across the six states, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Montana, and New Hampshire. They found that state-mandated parental notification laws have harmful impacts on youth similar to those in states with parental consent laws. Earlier this year, a similar law went into effect in Nevada, but that state is not included in the report. Legal challenges to Nevada’s law are ongoing.

When parents are able to withhold financial support, restrict young people’s movement or access to communication or transportation, or threaten life-altering consequences, they can effectively block young people’s access to abortion care even if the law requires only notice and not explicit consent, the researchers found.

“All young people should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and futures with the support of the people they trust,” said Jessica Goldberg, associate director of youth access at If/When/How and a co-author of the report. “Whether a young person can access abortion or not can determine the entire trajectory of their life. In this moment of continuous efforts to cut off access to abortion, it’s imperative that state policymakers use their power to remove needless barriers for young people.”

Even for young people who involve a parent and do not pursue judicial bypass, forced notification laws can delay and obstruct access to abortion, pushing young people to seek care later in pregnancy that may be more costly or time-consuming. Interviewees described young people delaying care by a week or more to track down contact information for a parent or legal guardian who was no longer involved in their lives. The laws compel some young people to involve unsupportive parents who belittle or shame them as they seek abortion care, the groups found.

In one case in the report, clinic staff believed a young person was so frightened by parental notification that she remained pregnant against her wishes. “We scheduled her for an appointment and hoped she could come, and we could walk her through the process [of parental notification or judicial bypass],” but the young person never made it to the appointment. “We lost contact with her.”

These laws also grant immense power to judges whose biases and antiabortion beliefs can influence their decisions to block a young person’s access to abortion. The system lends itself to arbitrary decision-making, with judges using factors such as young people’s grades, extracurricular activities, or career ambitions to determine their maturity to make an abortion decision.

“The idea that a young person is not mature enough to make a decision about whether they want to parent, but they are mature enough to raise a child … feels so disingenuous,” said the director of a clinic that provides abortion. “You can’t decide not to be pregnant, but you can raise a child for the rest of your life with no one questioning your maturity level?”

Parental notification laws and judicial bypass processes cause distinct and additional harm to youth already facing systematic barriers to accessing abortion care and fair treatment in the US legal system in general, especially Black, Indigenous, and other young people of color, and young people in the foster system, the groups found.

The deal involves the deportation and offshore detention of refugees, raising significant human rights concerns. Critics argue that this policy undermines Australia’s international standing and sparks internal political conflict. The Albanese Government is under pressure from both activists and allies to reassess its stance on immigration and human rights.

Background of the Nauru Deal

The Nauru deal, a cornerstone of Australia’s immigration policy, involves deporting asylum seekers to Nauru for offshore detention. This approach, aimed at deterring boat arrivals, has been controversial due to the harsh conditions reported on the island. The recent billion-dollar renewal of this policy has reignited debates over its efficacy and ethical implications. This move highlights Australia’s ongoing struggle with balancing border security and humanitarian obligations.

Human Rights Concerns

Key objections to the Nauru deal center on human rights violations. Reports from Nauru highlight overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and mental health issues among detainees. Organizations like Human Rights Watch argue that such conditions breach international human rights laws. The implications extend beyond ethics—these issues could tarnish Australia’s global reputation as a promoter of human rights. Critics urge immediate policy reform to align with international standards.

Domestically, the Nauru deal fuels political tensions. The Albanese Government faces criticism from opposition parties advocating more humane refugee policies. Economically, the billion-dollar expenditure raises questions about fiscal priorities amid budget constraints. Internationally, strained relations with countries prioritizing human rights could impact trade and diplomacy. The economic and political stakes emphasize the need for a balanced immigration strategy that considers both security and human rights.

Potential Paths for Policy Reform

Addressing these concerns requires strategic policy shifts. Advocates suggest increasing transparency in detention centers and improving living conditions for asylum seekers. Additionally, exploring alternative paths, such as onshore processing, might alleviate human rights criticisms while maintaining border security. For Australia, adopting more compassionate immigration policies could restore its international image and foster political stability.

This perspective is gaining traction among legislative analysts and human rights groups.

Final Thoughts

Australia’s Nauru deal remains a controversial element of its immigration policy. While aimed at controlling immigration, the approach has sparked significant human rights concerns and political unrest. The Albanese Government stands at a crossroads, needing to balance national security with ethical obligations. Addressing these issues could improve Australia’s global standing and internal political landscape. By reassessing and potentially reforming its policies, Australia has the chance to align more closely with international human rights standards—an essential move for future harmony.

It’s law enforcement at its most fearful.
He was willing to promote immigration enforcement in the manner that this administration wants, which is unlike anything I have ever seen before.","Every day, news of federal immigration raids, and the protests they attract, pop up across the country. Enforcement blitzes have drawn attention to Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities. In-your-face videos of aggressive tactics repeat — tear gas fired off in city streets, projectiles shot at journalists, children detained.

Sarah Saldaña, a former U.S. attorney in Texas, led Immigration and Customs Enforcement between 2014 and 2017 during President Barack Obama’s second term. Her tenure coincided with an influx of Central American families and unaccompanied children showing up at the Southern border, a period in which Obama received the moniker “deporter-in-chief” from immigration rights advocates. She was the last ICE director confirmed by Congress, and the agency has been led by acting heads ever since.

In a conversation with The Marshall Project that has been edited for clarity and length, Saldaña discussed how the agency has operated in past administrations and how it has changed since Trump returned to office earlier this year.

The Marshall Project: When you see ICE on the news today, what goes through your mind as a former leader? What tactics stick out to you?

Sarah Saldaña: We did not do our business out in public. We did not record our operations. Things are different. We weren’t out to make the news.

We were out to enforce the priorities of the administration, which at that time was [focusing on apprehending] terrorists down to aggravated felons, people who had a criminal conviction.

The priorities were not to go to a Home Depot and pick up people standing there waiting for day labor. That’s not something that happened. You planned ahead, and then you carried out the plan. And if you found the person you were looking for, that's the person you took. It wasn’t a matter of course that you would ask for identification of everybody in the household, let's say, and haul off people who were not a priority. That’s a very different operation than what’s happening now.

What do you think about the video footage that has been created and shared by Department of Homeland Security agencies like ICE?

I think the videoing is for clips for the evening news. That’s my opinion. All I know is that I’ve never seen ICE on the evening news so much as I have in the last three or four months. We were just as happy to work behind the scenes rather than having the people photographed or videoed. I think [Secretary] Kristi Noem is in half of them. And she’s not even with ICE. She’s with Homeland Security. She’s their boss, but I am not sure why she needs to go out on these operations other than one reason and one reason alone, and that’s advertising.

The secretary of Homeland Security has more important things to do than go out on operations. I can see doing it once or twice. I did it myself, just to know how an operation is conducted, but she’s in an awful lot of these videos. It strikes me as advertising. It strikes me as wanting to get the 15-second video and provide it to the evening news.

What’s your response to footage of the helicopters, flash-bangs and different means of luring people out of their homes during immigration enforcement operations?

I would describe it as “shock and awe.” It is intended. It is a different approach, certainly from what I experienced and from what I was familiar with. Its primary purpose does not appear to be making the community safer. It is intended to instill fear in those who might be subjected to our laws in the immigration area, as opposed to fostering public safety.

Is it effective?

If that’s the way you want to run your country, there are a lot of things that are effective. It’s effective to, like they are doing now, take drug dealers before trial, line them up against a wall, or shoot them in a boat and kill them. That’s very effective. That person won’t be dealing drugs anymore. But is it the way you want to run your country, is the question? Apparently the majority of the voting American public thought that was a good thing — that the ends justify the means. So it’s hard to say, “This is not our country,” because people had a choice when they voted and they voted for this approach.

Can ICE do these things?

Well, there are lawsuits all over the country that will test that issue. My personal belief is that a number of them, they cannot. And they will not withstand a legal challenge.

For instance?

The recent Supreme Court decision , I would say, to profile people. But clearly now that's legal after the Supreme Court case: If you speak Spanish and you look like you could be from another country, you could be interrogated. We will see where things come out. I am done predicting what the law of the land is because the Supreme Court is fashioning laws in a way that I would have never expected, like that profiling case.

My skin is brown. I speak Spanish fluently. I have been on occasion in old tattered clothes. I don’t think that that should be permitted to stop me — who was born in this country and has lived here for 73 years. I don’t think so, but apparently the law has changed, and profiling is allowable under those circumstances. We’ll see if specific cases are challenged, whether the facts of those cases justify if law enforcement can articulate a reason for stopping that person. It’s a slippery slope as far as I am concerned.

How would you have reacted to an agent stopping people for looking and sounding brown, or like they could potentially be undocumented?

It wouldn't have been tolerated.

Every administration has a right to set its own priorities. In this administration, it is, “Pick up anybody who is in the country without authorization.” Period. End of story. Even though they say, “Well, we are only after the worst of the worst,” I am sorry, that’s baloney.

What we are seeing today under this administration is extraordinary. It has never been done in this way before. There were already 11 or 12 million people without authorization in the United States before [President Joe] Biden took office. So I don’t know how you can blame President Biden for that. Now, did he let a lot more in? Of course he did. I have little patience for people who try to throw all that in one bag and say, “Look at where this country is now because of Biden.” It’s all the administrations beforehand. And it was the American public who said this is what I want to do. The voting public has a responsibility too.

You recently wrote a letter in The Dallas Morning News, titled “Stop the hate for ICE and for immigrants,” arguing for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws that would include a more secure border, reform of asylum restrictions and a “rational plan for allowing people from other countries to work here in jobs our citizens cannot or will not do.”

There is not a thoughtful, informed, methodical approach to immigration. It is slapdash, and as long as we don’t reform the immigration statute, not just through Band-Aids, but wholesale, we are going to continue this way. Every administration kind of comes in and does their thing. It doesn’t mean the future administrations considering comprehensive immigration reform won’t have their own priorities, I am just saying things like asylum can be tightened and accomplished without going after people who are here legally and seeking asylum.

What’s your reaction to Illinois state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat, who said ICE has acted like ""an invading army,"" with helicopters ""terrifying families"" from above, and in violation of people's ""right to live free from persecution and fear”?

I’d be open to somebody telling me how many times this has been repeated. I’d be open to those facts, but I have a problem with both sides using extreme rhetoric.

This idea that every immigrant who is in the country without authorization should not be dealt with, that’s not the law. The law prescribes that they have broken it by coming to the country without authorization. And remaining in the country without authorization is also illegal. I don’t know why we have to have an extreme on either side — either take everybody down or keep those borders open. There is so much wrong with both of those positions. It’s sad, but that’s where the extreme comes from.

Now this particular legislator, I am equally disturbed by activity like that [which Jiménez described]. I am not willing to say this is happening everywhere and it’s a national crisis. I don’t see it that way.

What do you think when you see federal agents with their faces covered, and the aggressive operations. Does that feel like the same agency to you?

No, no, no. It’s intended for TV. It’s intended for effect. It’s intended to instill fear. The ultimate objective is not legitimate law enforcement, it is to scare people to death. It is effective. There are a lot of people staying in their homes that would ordinarily come out, that are immigrants in the country without authorization. So, it’s effective. But it is disturbing to me to see that. It’s not law enforcement at its best. It’s law enforcement at its most fearful.

Face coverings?

There actually may be a basis for it. I think [immigration officers] are being targeted. Once they are targeted, of course, it’s not just the agent, it’s their families, their homes, getting doxxed. Now the left has provided a basis for those coverings. They weren’t legitimate at first, but now, you know, if I am on an airplane meeting somebody, I am not bragging that I am an ICE agent to anybody because they become targets. That Enforcement and Removal officer is not making policy.

What was Tom Homan, Trump’s appointed immigration czar, like to work with when you ran ICE?

I know him to be a great guy, based on my experience with him up through 2017. Very confident. Knows this area left and right. He is a convert, though, and a believer in this administration. He has always been fiercely loyal to whoever the head is. He was very easy to work with. I worried that he was going to die from a heart attack because he worked so hard. He’s a good human being. I just think he’s a believer in everything that this administration is doing.

He was willing to promote immigration enforcement in the manner that this administration wants, which is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I can’t judge him. I wish he would consider otherwise, but who is to say if you’ve got your own person in there. Expected to follow what the head honcho has to say. So, Tom is doing that.

Reportedly, ICE has increased spending for small arms from about $10 million to $70 million. Was it hard to get money when you were running ICE?

Not really, but our priorities were different. If you are picking up everybody, you are going to need a lot more money for that. Our priorities were, OK, we have $6 billion, we have 34,000 beds approved by Congress. Who should we be focusing on to fill those beds? Do we take a gardener who is working at a landscape company who has a pristine record in this country and has a family and has been here for decades? Or do we focus on the drug dealers, sexual assaults, domestic abuse perpetrators? It’s just prosecutorial discretion. Happens everyday in law enforcement. If we needed more money, we asked for it. Nothing like the numbers being discussed now.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/8ue3GBa_FYhMjMqKV4gwUBN8Vr8OWQp24dBjm5ukLTw/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9udHJ3a2VsZ2Ju/N2dvbm55eWphc2R4/N211dmZpLzI1MTAy/OV9DU29tb2Rldmls/bGFfU2FyYWhTYWxk/YW5hX0dldHR5SW1h/Z2VzLmpwZw,N,,2025-10-29 06:56:44.312385

The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio found that privilege did not apply and granted access.
I.e., the internal investigation was initiated by legal counsel for the purpose of providing legal advice.
It was therefore evident that the driving force behind the internal investigations was in anticipation of litigation.","On October 3, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that the fruits of internal company investigations conducted by counsel are protected by both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. In re FirstEnergy Corp., No. 24-3654.

In 2016, the federal government launched an investigation into FirstEnergy, an Ohio-based public utility company, in connection with an alleged bribery scheme involving later-convicted State Representative Larry Householder. As a response, FirstEnergy and its board retained separate outside counsel to perform internal investigations. Two securities class actions against FirstEnergy followed, and the claimants requested access to all withheld documents from the two separate investigations. The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio found that privilege did not apply and granted access. FirstEnergy petitioned the Sixth Circuit for a Writ of Mandamus and a stay of the District Court’s order. The Sixth Circuit overruled the District Court’s Order on the following grounds:

Attorney-client privilege applied because “what was true for” Upjohn Co. v. United States, was also true for FirstEnergy. I.e., the internal investigation was initiated by legal counsel for the purpose of providing legal advice.

The work product doctrine applied in First Energy’s case because both the company and its board retained outside counsel in anticipation of legal risk, which later became the actual risk of liability resulting from the government’s potential investigations. The Court highlighted that “but for” the federal government’s investigation into FirstEnergy, the company and its board would not have retained counsel for the internal investigations. It was therefore evident that the driving force behind the internal investigations was in anticipation of litigation.

Takeaways for In-House Counsel:

To avail itself of privilege, it is imperative to clearly establish that counsel is being engaged for legal advice, because, as the Court highlighted, what matters most under attorney-client privilege is that a company seeks legal advice. Therefore, in-house teams should avoid ambiguity surrounding the role of outside counsel to maintain attorney-client privilege, even if the information obtained from that engagement informs other (non-legal) decisions within the company.

Equally as important is to clearly state in engagement communications with outside counsel that their services are being sought as a response to anticipated legal risk and/or potential litigation, including labeling documents with “attorney work product.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15853_0143.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 10:01:05.550921

Bovino appeared Tuesday for a tense hearing before U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in downtown Chicago.
Those orders forbid agents from using tear gas or “riot control” weapons without giving two warnings and from deploying them against people who pose no immediate threat.
And that’s OK. That’s what democracy is,” Ellis said during the hearing, referring to protesters or others who might be voicing opposition to federal agents on the ground.
“If [federal agents] are using tear gas, they better be able to back it up,” she said.","CHICAGO — U.S. Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, the face of “Operation Midway Blitz” cracking down on illegal immigration, must report daily to a federal judge after reports of combative enforcement, including using tear gas.

Bovino appeared Tuesday for a tense hearing before U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in downtown Chicago. She questioned him about reports of aggressive immigration enforcement and the federal agents’ treatment of protesters, journalists and even children during the ongoing “immigration blitz.”

The hearing was part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by local media organizations alleging that federal agents have violated prior court orders restricting their use of force. Those orders forbid agents from using tear gas or “riot control” weapons without giving two warnings and from deploying them against people who pose no immediate threat.

“They don’t have to like what you’re doing. And that’s OK. That’s what democracy is,” Ellis said during the hearing, referring to protesters or others who might be voicing opposition to federal agents on the ground. “They can say they don’t like what you’re doing, that they don’t like how you’re enforcing the laws, that they wish you would leave Chicago and take the agents with you. They can say that, and that’s fine. But they can’t get teargassed for it.”

While Bovino’s immigration enforcement efforts came under scrutiny Tuesday, President Donald Trump threatened to send ""more than the National Guard"" to combat crime in blue cities like Chicago. Some National Guard members have already been sent to Illinois, though they have yet to be deployed to the streets. The president has also sent the National Guard into Washington and is seeking to send troops to Portland, Oregon.

In Chicago, the judge, an Obama appointee, imposed a new requirement: Bovino must meet with her every weekday to update her on the immigration enforcement efforts. “Mr. Bovino’s going to be here every day at 6 to tell me what happened,” she said.

From the outset of the hourlong hearing, Ellis made clear her expectations. “My role is not to tell you that you can or cannot enforce validly passed laws by Congress,” she said. “My role is simply to see that any enforcement of those laws is done in a manner that is consistent with your obligations under the law.”

The judge reminded Bovino of rules that state he must “leave journalists alone. If they’re doing their job, they need to be left alone to do their job.”

Bovino agreed. “We’re on the same page,” he said.

Bovino listened intently while on the stand, and at least once took time to gaze across the courtroom, which was crowded with reporters and a few onlookers.

Outside the courthouse, a few protesters waved signs reading “Stop ICE Brutality” and “Judge Sara Ellis is a Boss.”

Inside, the tone was serious as Ellis read anecdotes aloud from reports that federal agents had used tear gas in Chicago neighborhoods during Halloween festivities. “Kids were tear gassed on their way to celebrate Halloween,” the judge said, referring to an incident in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on Chicago’s North Side. “Those kids were dressed up in their Halloween costumes. You can imagine, their sense of safety was shattered.”

Halloween was on the judge’s mind as she told government attorneys: “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

For his part, Bovino responded throughout the informational hearing with “yes ma’am,” and challenged only when asked about tear gas being used. “Your honor, I believe that each situation is dependent on the situation. I’d like to know more about what happened.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs moved to ban tear gas altogether, but Ellis said for now she would not decide. “If [federal agents] are using tear gas, they better be able to back it up,” she said. “And if they can’t, then they will lose that as something they can use.”

Ellis raised concerns from the public that federal agents haven’t identified themselves. “I instructed all agents under my command to place an identifier conspicuously somewhere on their uniform,” Bovino replied. Ellis suggested IDs appear “in a conspicuous location” in at least two places, and Bovino agreed.

Ellis demanded that Bovino deliver use-of-force reports and body-worn camera footage compiled since Sept. 2.

And she ordered him to wear a camera himself. “The camera is your friend,” the judge said.

Bovino had acknowledged that he hadn’t been wearing one. “How about by Friday you get one for yourself?” Ellis asked. Bovino agreed, saying, “We can get that.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x7IeHFYMCuh6wslcl8CUKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/c1271e1ada2a1017b9eb1774c151e36a,N,,2025-10-29 10:56:44.921761

Mnemty, an anti-racism nongovernmental organization, became the latest group to receive a one-month suspension order on Tuesday, its spokesperson Zied Rouin said.

Its president, Saadia Mosbah, has been detained since May 2024 along with several other migrant rights activists, as a once-vibrant post–Arab Spring civil society has steadily been eroded throughout the tenure of President Kais Saied.

Mnemty’s announcement came less than a week after similar suspensions were handed down to other leading groups.

The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights — known by its French acronym FTDES — received a similar notice on Monday and the Tunisian Association for Democratic Women, a prominent feminist organization, days earlier.

Romdhan Ben Amor, FTDES spokesperson, told The Associated Press on Monday that he considered the move an attempt to deflect attention from major national issues, particularly environmental protests convulsing the city of Gabes. Targeting human rights groups like FTDES, he said, “aims to stigmatize individual and social rights and freedom defenders.”

He said he believed the group was targeted for its stances on two issues: the migration crisis and high-profile “conspiracy against state security” cases launched against politicians and opposition figures.

Ben Amor maintained that FTDES has always adhered to financial transparency laws. FTDES plans to appeal the suspension, he added.

The one-month suspension orders against FTDES and ATFD are the latest in a series of measures critics say are aimed at curbing the work and independence of civil society organizations since Saied’s 2021 consolidation of all branches of power.

As president, Saied has often cited foreign funding as a threat to Tunisia, using it to fuel a populist narrative and accuse his political opponents and social justice activists of being foreign agents and stirring unrest at home.

Colorado state law prohibits state and local agencies from assisting in most federal immigration enforcement.","Chaos erupted outside of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Tuesday in southwestern Colorado after agents took a family into custody and Durango police tried to get the children released. The arrest and subsequent protest have sparked outrage from some in the small city and statements denouncing ICE's actions from local immigrant advocacy groups.

In a now-widely circulated video, a masked agent took a 57-year-old woman's phone as she recorded the events and as she tried to retrieve it, he threw her to the ground. The agent is only identified with a patch on his vest that reads ""police"" with a badge next to it.

She and other protesters characterized it as theft and assault. This all unfolded around 6 a.m.

""I was videotaping this ICE agent, and I said to him -- because they swear that they're good Christians, right? -- and I said to him, 'you're a good Christian, right?' Looking him in the eyes, and I said, 'what would Jesus do?' and that's when he flipped out and- I don't know if he grabbed my phone or flicked it out of my hands, that's sort of a blur to me,"" Franci Stagi told CBS News Colorado in a Zoom interview on Tuesday. ""Then I had my knee-jerk reaction of sort of going after my phone, which I shouldn't have done, but I don't know, I just- so I did touch him on the shoulder after he grabbed my phone.""

That's when Stagi said the agent reacted violently.

""He grabbed me by the hair, and he lifted me off the ground somehow, in a chokehold. It's still really blurry, but I've seen the video myself,"" she said, choking up in tears as she recalled. ""Then he and two other ICE agents were over top of me which- they're huge people and it's just pretty surprising that this would happen.""

Stagi described herself as a 5-foot-2-inch waitress and worries about how children in custody are being treated -- the initial reason for the protest outside the facility.

""If they're doing this to me- there's an 11-year-old girl. A little girl and her brother in detention right now. What are they doing to her? It's horrible,"" she said. She went on to say the initial agent who grabbed her was pulled away from her by another masked agent, whose vest said ""ICE.""

The crowd of about 50 protesters gathered after they and immigrant advocacy groups said ICE arrested a Colombian family seeking asylum while the father took the children to school the previous day.

""Despite our members remaining entirely peaceful, an ICE agent violently punched one of our community members in the face,"" a statement from the Southwest Colorado Rapid Response Network read, in part. ""This excessive force against peaceful protestors is unacceptable and underscores the brutal tactics ICE is willing to employ.""

A spokesperson for ICE's Denver Field Office and the Department of Homeland Security -- ICE's parent agency -- in Denver, said the agency was looking into the incident and questions about the family's arrest and likely wouldn't have a response or statement until Wednesday.

A joint statement from city leaders said Durango police officers tried to intervene in the detention of the children.

""On multiple occasions, Durango Police requested to facilitate the release of the children to their mother, but were unsuccessful. On Tuesday, the Police Department received a report that one of the children may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse. In response, officers attempted to conduct a welfare check and to bring food. Unfortunately, federal agents denied officers entry to the facility,"" the statement read, in part.

""In moments like these, our duty is not only to uphold the law, but to preserve our humanity,"" Durango Police Chief Brice Current said in a statement. ""While we have a sworn responsibility not to interfere with federal operations, our department advocated for the children's well-being. These situations are complex and often misunderstood. I want to be clear: the Durango Police Department operates independently and remains fully committed to protecting every member of our community with compassion and professionalism.""

The detained family has not been publicly identified, but Stagi said the girl is 11 and her brother is 14.

City officials have asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate the events from the protest. Because the event occurred on federal property, the city says the FBI is also investigating.

In addition to calling for the release of the children, the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition is calling for an investigation into ""the use of excessive force by ICE agents against peaceful protestors"" and an investigation by the Colorado Attorney General's Office into ""local cooperation with ICE."" The organization specifically called attention to the participation of Colorado Highway Patrol troopers.

""The presence of state troopers with ICE raises alarming questions about the level of local and state cooperation in this operation,"" said Gladis Ibarra, co-executive director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. ""We need immediate clarity from state officials on their role in this family's separation and the violence that followed. The people of Colorado have a right to know if their state is violating its own laws to aid in tearing families apart.""

Colorado State Patrol said troopers did respond to the protest ""at the request of local law enforcement,"" saying protesters ""were reported to have blocked the facility's exit and bolted an access gate closed."" The agency said troopers did not assist in any immigration enforcement action or deploy any weapons or chemical munitions.

""The Patrol's role was to aid in de-escalation and protection of all parties present, maintain the peace, and address any identified unlawful behavior,"" CSP said in a statement.

Colorado state law prohibits state and local agencies from assisting in most federal immigration enforcement.

Stagi said she just wants the children released and reunited with their family.

""If my child was abducted and I knew where they were, I would hope that people would show up. I would hope people would show up and help me, even if they're total strangers,"" Stagi said. ""I see you. I hear your call. I feel what you're going through. I have empathy, compassion, I want to help you and I don't know how, but by being there physically with my presence, I was hoping to help. To be another person.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/29/34651f1d-0f58-4d66-acc9-4523b1b3c640/thumbnail/1200x630/7ff67d1fcdf6816e7ef3dfff8ced4672/durango-protest-3-frame-10.png,N,,2025-10-29 01:00:52.751462

“ICE has blocked all the mother’s attempts to see her children, and is reportedly preparing to forcibly separate these minor children from their father and send them alone to Texas.
In its statement, Durango officials said that ICE told local police that immigration agents tried to release the kids to another parent.
In a subsequent statement, an unnamed agency spokesperson wrote it arrived “at the request of local enforcement.” “The Patrol did not participate in any immigration enforcement action.
“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he wrote.","Two children and their father on their way to school were detained by federal immigration agents in southwestern Colorado on Monday, sparking protests from demonstrators who tried to prevent the family from being separated and moved to different facilities.

Videos of the protest posted on social media Tuesday show law enforcement clashing with demonstrators outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango, where agents in tactical gear carried weapons capable of firing less-lethal projectiles. Video taken overnight shows one agent taking and throwing a woman’s phone and then throwing the woman to the ground. Other protesters appeared to have been hit by projectiles fired by federal officers.

In a statement, the city of Durango said it had asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate the woman who was shoved by the federal agent.

Fernando Jaramillo Solano and his two children, ages 12 and 15, were detained by ICE on Monday morning while driving near their home, said Enrique Orozco-Perez, the co-executive director of the Compañeros Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

The family applied for asylum after coming to Colorado from Colombia and has an active, ongoing immigration case. The children’s mother, who is the primary applicant on the asylum case, has not been detained, the group said.

“ICE has blocked all the mother’s attempts to see her children, and is reportedly preparing to forcibly separate these minor children from their father and send them alone to Texas. This is not enforcement; it is a traumatic kidnapping of family members who are doing everything right and being punished for it,” Compañeros said in a statement.

Steve Kotecki, spokesman for ICE’s Denver field office, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The protests echoed similar opposition that’s been mounted against ICE facilities in Chicago and Portland, where protesters have gathered outside of the agency’s offices and detention centers.

Orozco-Perez said in an interview that Solano was “violently” arrested Monday morning while taking his kids to school. He shouted to volunteers who’d arrived to observe the arrest that his children were in the car, and the kids were also handcuffed and detained.

In its statement, Durango officials said that ICE told local police that immigration agents tried to release the kids to another parent. Orozco-Perez said the children’s mother was afraid to come to the scene for fear of being arrested. Local police “then offered to facilitate the release of the children back to their mother, but were informed that it was no longer an option,” according to the city’s statement.

Volunteer legal aides from the group also came to the ICE field office, where the family was held, to provide documents about the family’s pending asylum case. ICE officials refused to accept the documents, Orozco-Perez said.

The police also attempted a welfare check on the children, one of whom “may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse,” the city said. But Durango officers were denied entry into the facility.

“In moments like these, our duty is not only to uphold the law, but to preserve our humanity,” said Police Chief Brice Current. “While we have a sworn responsibility not to interfere with federal operations, our department advocated for the children’s well-being.”

Protesters began to gather outside the facility shortly after the arrests Monday. When an attorney later arrived to again try to provide documents to ICE, legal aides were told by ICE that the family would be detained together, Orozco-Perez said.

But the children’s mother later told advocates that she’d spoken with one of her kids and that they had been told they would be transported to Texas while their father was moved to Colorado’s immigration detention center in Aurora. Protesters then set up an all-night vigil to try to prevent any vehicles from leaving.

That’s when one volunteer from Compañeros was shoved by an ICE agent, Orozco-Perez said. Video posted to Facebook by the group shows a masked agent grab a phone from a volunteer who’d held her camera close to the man’s face. The agent then throws the phone as the woman yelled for him to return it. He then grabbed the woman and threw her to the ground, the video shows.

In its statement, the city said it had requested an independent investigation into the incident. Rob Lowe, spokesman for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment on the request Tuesday.

The protests continued into Tuesday morning and afternoon. Law enforcement began handcuffing and pulling people sitting in front of the office’s gates. A group of Colorado State Patrol troopers were also present and appeared to be clearing the road so several SUVs could leave the building. Protesters threw objects and bottles of water at the SUVs, one of which grazed a protester standing in the roadway as it sped past them.

Susy, who volunteers with a local immigrant advocacy group and asked to be identified only by her first name to avoid retaliation, said ICE personnel were picking up and “bodily throwing” protesters who’d blocked the gates. She said they were then sprayed in the face with pepperspray.

“To have it in our little peaceful community is just — ” she sighed. “I don’t know what to say. To have our own government attacking people and spraying tear gas in our faces, it’s bad.”

Video also shows a masked agent in tactical gear unloading what appear to be pepper balls from close range on two people sitting in the roadway.

“What you saw was people defending our community with their bodies, trying to not allow ICE to leave,” Orozco-Perez said.

Sgt. Ivan Alvarado, spokesman for the state patrol, said the agency was at the protest to assist. In a subsequent statement, an unnamed agency spokesperson wrote it arrived “at the request of local enforcement.”

“The Patrol did not participate in any immigration enforcement action. Demonstrators were reported to have blocked the facility’s exit and bolted an access gate closed,” the spokesperson wrote. “The Patrol’s role was to aid in de-escalation and protection of all parties present, maintain the peace, and address any identified unlawful behavior. Members of the Colorado State Patrol did not use any weapons or chemical munitions.”

Tom Sluis, spokesman for the city, said the city had notified the patrol about ICE’s apparent plans to transport the family and that the patrol then said it would be present at the Durango facility.

In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis said he was “deeply concerned” about the family’s detention.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he wrote. “The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families.”

In a statement, Durango School District spokesperson Karla Sluis said the district could not confirm whether any students were involved in “immigration enforcement action” because of federal privacy laws.

“Our schools remain safe and welcoming places for every student who walks through our doors. By both state and federal law, every child is entitled to a public education regardless of background or circumstance, and the district does not collect or share information about immigration status,” Sluis said.

The Durango arrests come days after a Parker teacher and her family were detained during a routine check-in appointment in Centennial, despite having legal authorization to live and work in the United States.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-Z-durango-ice-protest-003.jpg?w=1024&h=955,N,,2025-10-28 23:17:14.840019

It was that order, halting the mission while litigation proceeded, that the appeals court panel would go on to assess.
But in its Oct. 20 order, the appeals court panel majority disagreed, finding that Immergut should have deferred more to Trump’s analysis of events and his military judgement.
The dissenting judge on the panel had asked her colleagues on the broader appeals court to consider rehearing the case en banc—as a larger group.
Soon, another judge on the appeals court initiated proceedings for a vote.","In yet another twist in a weighty legal dispute, an appeals court has cancelled a ruling that had largely cleared the way for the Trump administration to deploy U.S. troops in Portland, opting to rehear the matter with a larger group of judges instead.

“Upon the vote of a majority of nonrecused active judges, it is ordered that this case be reheard en banc,” wrote Chief Judge Mary H. Murguia of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an order Tuesday evening. The previous order, which a three judge panel of the court had published Oct. 20 “is vacated,” she wrote.

“This ruling shows the truth matters and that the courts are working to hold this administration accountable,” said Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield in a statement shortly after the latest order came down. “The Constitution limits the president’s power, and Oregon’s communities cannot be treated as a training ground for unchecked federal authority.”

What comes next at the appeals court level was not immediately clear. The order gave no other information, and did not set a schedule for its proceedings.

But the development means a Portland district court judge’s temporary restraining orders, which have now for weeks been blocking the deployment, are set to remain in place until their natural expiration dates, which remain a few days out.

Meanwhile, Oregon continues to seek a more durable block on the deployment: an injunction. The lower court is set to consider this matter in a three-day bench trial beginning Wednesday.

It has now been a month since President Donald Trump acted, following a provocative post on his social media platform, Truth Social, to deploy federalized Oregon National Guard members to Portland to quash protests surrounding the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on the south end of town—a move state and local leaders said was plainly unnecessary, but which the president said would restore order to a leftist hellscape allegedly besieged by domestic terrorists.

Arguing that this nightmarish characterization was an absurd fiction, Oregon officials filed suit, and won a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment to Portland. It was that order, halting the mission while litigation proceeded, that the appeals court panel would go on to assess.

The lower court judge, Karin J. Immergut, had found that the conditions on the ground in Portland did not appear meet any of the legally relevant circumstances under which the President was authorized to federalize the National Guard for domestic deployment.

But in its Oct. 20 order, the appeals court panel majority disagreed, finding that Immergut should have deferred more to Trump’s analysis of events and his military judgement.

The appeals court decision, rejecting the reasoning of the lower court’s first restraining order, seemed to all but clear the way for the deployment to proceed.

Yet there was another wrinkle. The dissenting judge on the panel had asked her colleagues on the broader appeals court to consider rehearing the case en banc—as a larger group. Soon, another judge on the appeals court initiated proceedings for a vote.

On Friday, the appeals court, noting that it had the consent of the members of the smaller panel, paused the Oct. 20 ruling of their colleagues while they considered whether to go the en banc route and hear the case as a larger cohort. The results of that vote arrived Tuesday evening.

On Wednesday morning, meanwhile, the case is set to proceed on a parallel track in Immergut’s courtroom at the federal courthouse in Portland.

Lawyers for Oregon and the Trump administration have in recent days been filing briefs citing various authorities—old court cases, media reports, an 1891 dictionary definition for the word “rebellion”—as they establish their basic cases for why the judge should, or should not, establish a more durable block on the deployment.

At issue is whether the situation at the ICE facility justified the calling in of the National Guard—and specifically, whether the president, as the applicable federal law puts it, “is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” or “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

In its brief, the U.S. government argues that “both conditions apply in Portland.”

In the weeks and months before the president made this assessment, Trump administration lawyers write, “agitators assaulted federal officers and damaged federal property in numerous ways.”

In its brief, however the state of Oregon and its allies say the challenges federal and local law enforcement have faced outside that facility have been plainly ordinary.

If the protests indeed grew violent in June, they remained well the capacity of law enforcement to manage, the state says, and from there they grew far tamer, into September, when police reports indicate little of note was happening outside the ICE facility at all.

Then, Oregon says, came Trump’s Sept. 27 post saying he would send troops to “War ravaged” Portland. Crowd sizes and tensions again increased, Oregon officials argue, though the most problematic interactions involved altercations between protesters and counter protestors—rather than being directed at federal officers.

One thing that both parties seem to agree on is that relations between the Portland Police Bureau and federal agents have been poor of late—though their analyses differ greatly.

The feds note that local law forbids PPB from assisting with immigration enforcement, but that the local police department has an “extraordinarily capacious understanding of the scope of this prohibition” and has at times refused to help to protect the ICE facility, or work constructively with their federal counterparts to, say, clear the ICE driveway of protesters.

Portland Police Bureau officers are set to testify otherwise at trial. And the state’s brief, for its part, argues that relations soured as federal law enforcement needlessly deployed munitions, gassing PPB officers themselves and creating made-for-TV spectacles out of minor protest events. Meanwhile the state says, the federal officer deployment surged without a clear command and control structure, undermining communication between federal and local officials.

As an example of the problems that emerged, the brief notes a moment when pepper balls were shot in the direction of a PPB officer. When confronted, the brief says said, federal officials responded, “help or get out of the way.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/NTDHZXJD2JDYVPMNUFEIV6PS3I.jpg?smart=true&auth=33dd5c63b73248b8e8e25b9e5951e08324efcb94fd949d237773ef1d039c915d&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-29 01:56:58.141089

“The Supreme Court does not appear to give a great deal of weight to district court findings of credibility.","By Andrew Chung

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s administration has told the U.S. Supreme Court he needs to deploy National Guard troops to the Chicago area in part because local police have failed to respond to what the Justice Department described as mob violence by people protesting his aggressive immigration enforcement.

Those law enforcement agencies have given the nine justices a starkly different account of protests they called limited in scale, detailing in court filings how they have responded on specific dates and explaining how a unified command they set up to coordinate efforts dealt effectively with the demonstrations.

This is just one of many contrasts in how events on the ground are being portrayed in the case, creating for the justices what may be a dilemma over who to believe as they mull the Justice Department’s October 17 emergency request to allow the deployment. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the move, rejecting the administration’s legal rationale and its version of events. The Supreme Court could act at any time.

The Justice Department relied heavily in its Supreme Court request on two written statements to justify its stated need for the National Guard to protect federal agents and property. The statements by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency official Russell Hott and Border Patrol official Daniel Parra portray the situation on the ground as dire and dangerous.

The Justice Department cited Hott’s declaration 37 times in its 40-page application to the Supreme Court, and Parra’s 15 times, a Reuters analysis showed.

Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry found the sources of the administration’s facts to be unreliable, a determination an appeals court upheld.

“In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor” by Hott and Parra, Perry wrote in her decision, “it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts.”

In the U.S. legal system, trial judges and juries have the primary role in fact-finding, with higher courts generally deferring to those conclusions.

“Here, the district judge carefully detailed the factual record and found it ‘impossible to align’ with the statements in the affidavits submitted by the administration. The judge also raised serious credibility concerns with those statements,” said Brandon Garrett, a Duke University School of Law expert in legal evidence.

Garrett said it would be “all the more problematic for the Supreme Court to engage in fact-finding which is outside of its role as an appellate court.”

University of Chicago constitutional law professor Aziz Huq said it is not surprising for the court to be encountering a major gap between versions of events given its increasing willingness to settle weighty matters on its so-called emergency docket – as in this case – before the facts of a dispute have been fully determined.

“The Supreme Court has created a situation in which the ordinary process for settling factual disputes no longer exists in these cases,” Huq said.

The Justice Department declined to comment. An ICE spokesperson said that agency “is not going to comment on court documents and pending litigation.” The Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.

DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENTS

In their legal challenge to Trump’s deployment, the city of Chicago and state of Illinois have said he is using protests that have been limited in size and severity as a pretext to dispatch troops to punish adversaries and stifle dissent. They noted that Trump has talked about sending the military into Democratic-led cities like Chicago for years.

Trump since June has deployed troops to various Democratic-led jurisdictions in an extraordinary expansion of the use of the military for domestic purposes. Trump also has sent them to Los Angeles, Memphis and Washington, D.C., and has sought to dispatch them to Portland.

Challenges to those deployments are playing out in other cities. A judge who already has blocked the Portland deployment is set to preside over a trial beginning on Wednesday.

GLARING DIFFERENCES

A comparison of statements provided by both sides as evidence in the case reveals important differences in how the situation in Chicago and at a federal immigration processing facility called BSSA in the suburb of Broadview is being described, including the nature and size of protests and the response of local and state authorities.

Hott stated that “riots at the BSSA escalated from September 12 to the present,” alleging blocked traffic, vandalized property and assaults on personnel. Broadview Police Department Chief Thomas Mills, in his own written statement, never mentions a riot or rioters, and said protesters number typically fewer than 50.

On the use of tear gas and pepper spray near the BSSA, Parra said federal agents take such steps only after issuing warnings and only against “assaultive subjects.” But Mills called this use by federal agents indiscriminate and “unlike anything I have seen before,” sometimes targeting a protest with no more than 10 people.

The Hott and Parra statements use nearly identical language in detailing an October 4 incident in which a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a female driver in Chicago who allegedly aimed her car at the agent, the Reuters analysis found.

For instance, both statements include the following passage: “Approximately 200 rioters converged near the scene of the shooting at three separate locations. Over the next four hours, rioters threw objects at agents, including glass bottles and traffic cones, and forcefully pushed the agents. The Chicago Police Department initially refused to assist, but over one hour later, they provided perimeter security.”

The gender of the federal agent who shot the woman was changed from male in the Hott and Parra statements to female in the Justice Department’s later Supreme Court filing.

“A declaration or affidavit is far less credible if it uses repeated text or legal language,” Garrett said. “A hearing can shed more light on such documents. And that kind of fact-finding is the role of a district court. The Supreme Court is not in a position to carefully evaluate a factual record.”

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces answering to state governors except when called into federal service by the president. Trump has relied on a law that lets a president deploy state National Guard troops to suppress a rebellion or if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Trump’s administration federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops and ordered more Texas National Guard troops into Illinois.

WINNING WAYS

In almost every challenge to Trump’s actions since he returned to office in January, the Supreme Court has ruled in his favor, often lifting orders imposed by district court judges.

“The Supreme Court does not appear to give a great deal of weight to district court findings of credibility. To my mind, that is a very problematic stance for the court to take,” Huq said.

“It suggests that the Supreme Court has the power not just to pick and choose what the law is, but it has the power to pick and choose what the facts are,” Huq added.

Perry, appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment as likely violating the federal law establishing preconditions for use of National Guard troops as well as the state’s rights under the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

Perry faulted the statements by Hott and Parra for “equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence.”

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously left Perry’s order in place, concluding “the facts do not justify the president’s actions in Illinois.” Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Trump.

Richard Friedman, a University of Michigan Law School expert on evidence and the Supreme Court, said if the justices apply normal standards, they would overturn the district judge’s factual findings only if they are “clearly erroneous” – a high bar, Friedman said.

That form of deference may yield to another in this case, given it involves the president and his power over military matters.

“The court will presumably give a great deal of deference to the executive,” Friedman said.

Kristine Beckerle “The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.","A new, in-depth investigation by Amnesty International concludes that a US air strike on a migrant detention centre in Sa’ada, north-western Yemen, on 28 April 2025 that killed and injured dozens of African migrants amounted to an indiscriminate attack. US authorities must promptly and transparently investigate it as a war crime.

The attack, carried out by the US military during “Operation Rough Rider,” inflicted catastrophic civilian harm on vulnerable migrants, many of whom were held by the Huthi de facto authorities in the detention centre solely for their irregular immigration status.

‘It is a miracle we survived’: US air strike on civilians held in Sa’ada detention centre is based on interviews with 15 survivors, all of whom were Ethiopian migrants detained in Sa’ada, and analysis of digital evidence, including satellite imagery, photos and videos. The report provides compelling evidence that, in carrying out this attack, the US failed to abide by its obligation under international humanitarian law to distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives.

The strike killed and injured dozens of the migrants held at the detention centre at the time of the attack. Survivors who spoke to Amnesty International were able to identify by name and approximate age 16 of the people – all Ethiopian migrants, all men and most in their twenties – who had been killed.

This was a lethal failure by the US to comply with one of its core obligations under international humanitarian law.

Kristine Beckerle, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The harrowing testimonies from survivors paint a clear picture of a civilian building, packed with detainees, being bombed without distinction. This was a lethal failure by the US to comply with one of its core obligations under international humanitarian law: to do everything feasible to verify whether the object attacked was a military objective,” said Kristine Beckerle, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“Victims and their families should receive full reparation, including financial compensation. Given the air strike killed and injured civilians, the US authorities should investigate this attack as a war crime. Where sufficient evidence exists, competent authorities should prosecute any person suspected of criminal responsibility, including under the doctrine of command responsibility.”

Amnesty International formally requested information from US Central Command (CENTCOM) and US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) on 27 August 2025, detailing its findings and seeking clarification on the military objective attacked and the precautions taken. CENTCOM provided only a brief response on the same day the request was sent, stating that it was still “assessing all reports of civilian harm”, that it was taking all of them “seriously” and reviewing them “thoroughly”.

Amnesty International also requested information from the Huthi de facto authorities on 11 September 2025, sharing its findings and seeking clarification regarding the uses of the Sa’ada prison compound and the migrant detention centre, the number of people detained at the time of the attack, their conditions of detention, and what steps, if any, the Huthi authorities took to investigate the failure of prison guards to allow detainees to seek safe shelter.

The Huthi Ministry of Justice and Human Rights provided two detailed responses on 24 September and 6 October 2025, including information on the number of migrants detained at the centre, denying any wrongdoing in terms of conditions of detention, and sharing a list of casualties from the US air strike.

A mass-casualty attack on a known civilian target

Amnesty International’s investigation found no evidence that the migrant detention centre was a military objective. Survivors said the migrant detention centre was an open space, so they were able to see everyone who was present in the building, whom were all migrant detainees.

The facility, part of the Sa’ada prison compound, had been used for years by the Huthis to detain migrants, and its civilian nature was widely known. It was visited by humanitarian organizations.

A few years earlier, on 21 January 2022, the Saudi-led coalition carried out an air strike on another detention facility within the same prison compound in Sa’ada. The 2022 attack, which Amnesty International also investigated, was carried out using a US-made precision guided munition, killing more than 90 detainees and injuring dozens.

Given this context, the US should have known the facility was a civilian object and that any aerial attack could result in significant death and injury to civilians. Under international humanitarian law, attacking forces have an obligation to do everything feasible to verify whether their intended target is a military objective and, if there is doubt in this respect, to refrain from launching an attack or to cancel or suspend it.

Survivors severely injured, maimed and traumatized

Almost all the 15 survivors Amnesty International spoke to said that they were sleeping when they heard the sound of an explosion nearby, sometime between 4 and 4:30 a.m. This was most likely a US air strike on a different structure within the Sa’ada prison compound which took place minutes earlier.

According to satellite imagery, another building, located about 180 meters from where the migrants were detained, was hit and destroyed the same day. In their response to Amnesty International, the Huthis stated that this building was a prison administration building.

Survivors said they woke up terrified and ran towards the gate of the detention centre. They screamed for help and pounded on the gate, asking the prison guards to let them out to seek safety. Instead, prison guards fired warning shots, to keep the detainees inside. Minutes later, a second US airstrike hit the migrant detention centre.

In their response to Amnesty International, the Huthi de facto authorities stated that 117 African migrants were detained at the time of the strike, of whom 61 were killed and 56 injured. They also claimed that “there were no recorded instances in which prison guards prevented detainees from fleeing the targeted area or from seeking a safe location”, but did not respond clearly to whether they had investigated this particular incident.

The air strike caused profound civilian harm with devastating, long-lasting consequences. Of the 15 survivors interviewed by Amnesty International, 14 sustained critical injuries with lifelong impacts including lost limbs, serious nerve damage, as well as head, spine and chest trauma. Two of the 15 migrants had their legs amputated, one had his hand amputated, and one lost an eye.

One 20-year-old survivor, Hagos*, who lost his leg and regained consciousness days after the attack in hospital, described his pain, stating: “You just wish you were dead there… I am begging for some money from friends to get the treatment and pills.”

Another survivor, Desta*, suffered from a head injury and lost one of his eyes. He was so traumatized that he could not speak for 20 days. He said: “The attack was really terrible, it killed lots of people, it made us disabled and left others in shock and terror.”

At the time of the interviews, almost two months after the US air strike, 10 survivors said that they still required some form of medical treatment, including follow up surgeries and medication. They also said that, despite their dire economic situation, they were paying for this treatment themselves or with the support of their financially struggling families back home.

Urgent call for accountability and reparations

In addition to its obligations under international humanitarian law, the USA has codified in its domestic law and policies key human rights protections and international humanitarian law obligations. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response notes that mitigating civilian harm is not limited to compliance with international humanitarian law and encourages commanders to “take additional protective measures not required by the law of war as they deem appropriate”.

Critical systems put in place in recent years in the US to reduce and better respond to civilian harm caused by US military actions abroad are under threat by the Trump Administration. Amnesty International urges the US Congress to ensure that civilian harm mitigation and response mechanisms remain intact and robustly funded to effectively respond to this and other recent incidents.

The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.

Kristine Beckerle

“The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public. Survivors of this attack deserve nothing less than full justice. They must receive full, effective, and prompt reparations, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, through an effective and accessible mechanism,” said Kristine Beckerle.

Amnesty International also urges the Huthi de facto authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into the failure to evacuate and provide shelter to the detained migrants. They should also end the arbitrary detention of migrants based solely on their immigration status and nationality and provide survivors of the US air strike with temporary residency status so they may recuperate, heal, and complete essential medical treatment without fear of re-detention.

The administration is downplaying the importance of a leadership reshuffle at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the infusion of Customs and Border Protection leaders into ICE field offices is already getting a sour reception at the agency.

The move, news of which broke Monday night, involved sending CBP leaders into as many as 12 of ICE’s “underperforming” field offices. Deputy ICE Director MADISON SHEAHAN said on Fox this morning, “What you are seeing here is us being able to work with Secretary [KRISTI NOEM] and President [DONALD TRUMP] to be able to deliver on his promise to remove the worst of the worst.”

But there’s already internal blowback. An administration official told our own Myah Ward that “it’s not going over well at ICE. Not at all going over well.” NatSec Daily granted the official anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the personnel changes.

Border Patrol is a significantly more aggressive agency than ICE, but it lacks some of ICE’s community knowledge that could be useful in the sensitive situations Trump’s crackdown could create, according to KATHLEEN BUSH-JOSEPH, an immigration lawyer and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute think tank in Washington.

Border Patrol is “used to very quickly deport primarily single Mexican men, and they were the ones who were doing expedited removal, which means deportation in a matter of hours,” she told NatSec Daily. ICE, meanwhile, is used to dealing with the issues that arise when federal agents arrest people in workplaces and in their neighborhoods.

That makes it likely that the leadership reshuffle is teeing up additional internal divisions within the U.S. government’s immigration enforcement apparatus.

The shakeup at ICE — which is expected to affect field offices in cities including Los Angeles, San Diego, New Orleans and Philadelphia — comes as progress has stalled towards the Trump administration’s promise to deport a million unauthorized immigrants in a year. ICE has had to navigate a limited number of beds to hold and process immigrants in its custody and intense pressure from the White House over the last few months. It has pushed to quickly hire 10,000 new agents, but that recruitment is expected to still take some time as officers are screened and trained.

The Trump administration has commissioned CBP agents and Border Patrol officers, as well as agents and officials from across the U.S. government, to support ICE as it tries to ramp up deportations. Arrivals at the southern border have ticked up in recent months, but those numbers are still below the levels they were at when the Trump administration took office.

The U.S. government also hasn’t released comprehensive data about removals in months, leading some analysts to question whether the deportation figures the administration touts are accurate.

For its part, DHS is arguing that there’s no daylight between any parts of the administration on how to achieve deportation and immigration goals.

Spokesperson TRICIA McLAUGHLIN told NatSec Daily that “since the beginning, President Trump promised to arrest the worst of the worst criminals and those in our country illegally. Our leadership understands that mission and is committed to defending the homeland.” McLaughlin also pushed back on the idea that these would be anything more than “standard personnel changes.”

The Inbox

RAFT OF RARE EARTHS: Trump and Japanese Prime Minister SANAE TAKAICHI signed an agreement today to each “intensify” their efforts to increase the “resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.” In other words, make sure there are plenty of options beyond China for obtaining minerals needed for advanced technology, including on the battlefield.

The framework, released by the White House, says reps from both countries will convene a bilateral ministerial on mining within 180 days. The two sides also agreed to take steps to “provide financial support” to projects that will generate products for delivery in the U.S., Japan and “like-minded countries.”

Critical minerals have been a clear focus of Trump’s trip through Asia, and he has reached agreements with Cambodia and Malaysia and frameworks with Thailand and Vietnam to cooperate on the processing and exports of critical minerals. He inked another with Australia last week to boost efforts to produce the coveted raw materials.

NADIA SCHADLOW, a former deputy national security adviser for strategy, told NatSec Daily these deals should be seen in the context of Trump’s meeting planned for Thursday with Chinese President XI JINPING.

“It gives Trump leverage ahead of his meeting with Xi,” she said. “It shows there’s ongoing concern over giving the Chinese continuing leverage over critical inputs. This is an alternative, this is a counterweight. These deals show how powerful working with partners can be.”

CEASEFIRE ON THE ROCKS: The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be in trouble.

Israel launched strikes on an area of Gaza close to Shifa hospital after Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU declared that he’d ordered strikes on the strip earlier today.

In a post to social media ahead of the attacks Netanyahu announced that he had ordered the military to “immediately carry out forceful strikes in the Gaza Strip” after “security consultations,” our own Gregory Svirnovskiy reports.

Although Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations since the peace agreement was struck earlier this month, Israel’s move today marks a major escalation of conflict under the fragile truce.

Netanyahu did not provide a rationale for the decision, though Israel earlier today claimed that Hamas had opened fire at Israeli military forces in southern Gaza, adding to frustrations over Hamas’ return of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage that had already been retrieved.

Hamas has accused Israel of obstructing the entry of heavy machinery needed to clear rubble and find bodies, both of Israeli hostages and Palestinians killed in airstrikes. Today, the group said Israel is violating the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to hold Israel to the terms of the ceasefire. It also said it would delay the handover of a body of an Israeli hostage “due to violations by the occupation.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the strike decision.

HIT ’EM WHERE IT HURTS: Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY wants to expand Ukraine’s strikes against oil facilities deep within Russia and is stressing that he needs more weapons to do it, our own Veronika Melkozerova reports.

In comments to a small group of journalists Monday, including Veronika, Zelenskyy pointed to the success of prior strikes on Russian oil facilities that forced the country to redistribute production to other refineries.

“Therefore, our task is absolutely clear,” Zelenskyy said, “to continue our work at other plants that have started to increase the volume, especially diesel.” According to the BBC, Kyiv has hit 21 of Russia’s 38 major oil refineries since January.

The Ukrainian president said that a key priority for Kyiv is building upon its long-range capabilities. While Ukraine completed 90 percent of deep strikes into Russia with its own long-range drones and cruise missiles, according to Zelenskyy, he said he still wants European allies to continue giving long-range missiles to help with the effort. In addition to its own weapons, Kyiv also uses U.K.-made Storm Shadow and French SCALP missiles.

Zelenskyy hopes that a combination of continued strikes on Russian refineries and pressure from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies — as well as a potential European loan to Kyiv funded by Russian frozen assets — could force Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN to the negotiating table.

CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE: The Federal Communications Commission is taking more steps to prevent imports of high-risk communications technology, in particular targeting gear from China, our own John Hendel reports (for Pros!)

In a unanimous vote today, the FCC moved to close loopholes on imports of gear on the so-called covered list of tech considered to present national security risks to the U.S. Among the security concerns: fears that adversaries like China could use the equipment for espionage.

Today’s move addressed worries that some of the equipment on the list was still being used, since FCC rules didn’t bar use of previously authorized versions of the gear. Under the proposal, earlier models of equipment sold by Chinese companies like Huawei and Hikvision would join the list of barred import items.

The vote immediately garnered backlash from China’s Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. and Hikvision, who argued that the move “exceeds the scope” of the FCC’s authority.

The Complex

HOW MANY IS IT NOW? Another day, another set of boat strikes.

The U.S. military conducted three more strikes on four boats suspected of ferrying drugs in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, Secretary of Defense PETE HEGSETH announced in a post on social media today.

The strikes killed 14 people and left one survivor. According to Hegseth, Mexican search and rescue authorities took responsibility for coordinating the survivor’s rescue, roping another country into the U.S.’s widening military operation in the region. But the Mexican navy has yet to locate the individual, The Wall Street Journal reports.

During a news conference Tuesday, Mexican President CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM said she had requested a discussion on the strikes between the Mexican navy, foreign ministers and the U.S. ambassador in Mexico City as part of a new security initiative between the two countries, the Journal reports.

As in previous attacks, Hegseth claimed that the individuals aboard the ships were “narco-terrorists,” but did not provide evidence for those allegations.

On the Hill

KUWAIT AMB. NOMINEE TANKING: It’s been a bad few days for Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Kuwait.

AMER GHALIB, the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, is facing bipartisan opposition over his history of allegedly antisemitic remarks. At least three Senate Foreign Relations Republicans plan to vote “no” on Ghalib, our own Benjamin Guggenheim reports today, all but assuring that his nomination won’t succeed inside the panel — or on the chamber floor.

If three Republicans join all Democrats to vote “no,” then Vice President JD VANCE would have to cast a tie-breaking vote. Sen. JOHN CURTIS (R-Utah), Sen. TED CRUZ (R-Texas) and Sen. JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas) all said they’d vote against Ghalib. A potential fourth lawmaker, Sen. PETE RICKETTS (R-Neb.) indicated that he’s not committed to supporting Ghalib’s nomination either.

Ghalib was grilled during a hearing last week over comments he’d previously made suggesting that Israel deserved to be attacked by Hamas and for lauding the Muslim Brotherhood and SADDAM HUSSEIN. The Michigan mayor made waves last year for his endorsement of Trump, as a Muslim mayor alongside an all-Muslim city council in the small Midwestern city.

Broadsides

WE’RE WATCHING YOU: Major importers of Russian oil are railing against the Trump administration’s new sanctions, but Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) is warning that the U.S. won’t put up with plans to undermine its sanctions efforts.

“To Hungary, Turkey and Slovakia: if you think we’re not watching your efforts to undercut U.S. sanctions on Russian oil, you are mistaken,” the Russia hawk cautioned in a social media post today, adding that purchasing Russian oil “is funding terrorism, death and destruction.”

Hungarian Prime Minister VIKTOR ORBAN said last week that the country was working on ways to “circumvent” U.S. sanctions on Russian oil. Hungary, along with Turkey and Slovakia, remain largely reliant on Russian oil, while other European countries have made efforts to shift away from those imports since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

According to court records, Bonilla was in court before he escaped custody on Monday for an adjudicatory hearing.

Bonilla was found guilty of assault and battery of a family member. He received a 90-day jail sentence, but all 90 days were suspended. He was charged a $91 fine.

Bonilla was also facing charges of damaging a phone line to prevent a 911 call; however, those charges were dropped.

This is the first known deportation under the Government’s recently expanded Nauru regime – a secretive and multi-billion-dollar arrangement that allows people to be banished offshore.

Earlier today it was reported that Nauru’s President, David Adeang, told the Nauruan Parliament last Friday that the first person had arrived under the new offshore detention deal. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, which supports people seeking asylum held on Nauru, had heard reports of an arrival but has been unable to confirm or make contact with the individual. The organisation holds serious concerns for the person’s wellbeing, safety and current whereabouts.

The Albanese Government made a secret deal with Nauru for the transfer of migrants and refugees in the so-called NZYQ cohort. The deal was signed alongside new laws allowing deportations to occur without any consideration of the consequences people would face, such as whether a person might die without proper medical care, be permanently separated from their families, or face persecution in Nauru.

It was revealed in estimates it could cost up to $7 billion, and there are serious concerns about corruption risks tied to past offshore detention contracts, including payments to companies linked to criminal organisations.

The organisations are calling on the Albanese Government to immediately halt deportations to Nauru, end offshore detention once and for all, and uphold equal treatment under our laws. Australians voted against fear and division at the last election, and they will not accept the return of cruel, secretive policies that punish people for seeking safety.

Jana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“This kind of ICE-like behaviour ripping people from our community is not in line with what our community expects from our government. This is a scary, shocking precedent, and it is not what people voted for in the recent Federal election.

Deportations are life-changing – we all know people who weren’t born here, who we consider as part of our community. It’s another blatant example of politicians trying to distract us from the real issues and demonising migrants – and they are spending billions of dollars in secrecy to do it.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre said:

“The Albanese Government has today demonstrated it is willing to completely disregard the basic rights of migrants and refugees, and ignore serious questions about the lawfulness and safety of its deportation deal, by condemning the first person to exile in Nauru. The government’s mass deportation plans have been shrouded in secrecy from the outset to ensure that it does not have to grapple with the real, human consequences of its actions.

“Some people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives, others are stateless with no other home, and some have serious health conditions meaning they will likely die in Nauru. They should not be subjected to lifelong suffering. Our rights should be the same, regardless of visa status.”

Sarah Dale, RACS Centre Director & Principal Solicitor said:

“There have been many dark days in our immigration history: 24 August 2001, 19 July 2013 and now we add 24 October 2025 to that list. It is a day when our country chose exile over basic principles of humanity. This should shake to the core anyone who cares about the rights of refugees in our community.

We do not seek to deny the complexity of the situation for many of the people in this cohort. However, exile, family separation, significant ill-health and possible return to a fate of torture or death – none of these should be an acceptable outcome for any human being. It’s yet another dire chapter added to the horror story of Australia’s deplorable Offshore Detention policy.”

Paul Power, CEO of the Refugee Council of Australia said:

By Arnie Alpert, Active with the Activists

Arnie Alpert spent decades as a community organizer/educator in NH movements for social justice and peace. Officially retired from the American Friends Service Committee since 2020, he keeps his hands (and feet) in the activist world while writing about past and present social movements.

CONCORD—Immigrants’ rights activists from several New Hampshire cities and towns on Tuesday announced the formation of Sanctuary Communities, a grassroots project to oppose “police state tactics” employed by federal immigration enforcement agencies.

At a news conference held at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church across the street from the State House in Concord, the group said that while it is now illegal for municipalities to refuse cooperation with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the law cannot prevent Americans from exercising their Constitutional rights to protest, publicize, and lawfully resist the agency’s actions.

“We’re here as people of faith, people of conscience, people of conviction and compassion, who are doing what people have done for millennia: organize to protect community members who are facing persecution, organize to insist on a better world, to insist that our values of love and care and dignity are reflected in how we treat each other, creating circles of support and accompaniment and resources, attempting to match the courage and the leadership of immigrants in this community who are targeted by so much racism and xenophobia and dehumanization,” said Maggie Fogarty, a member of the Seacoast Interfaith Sanctuary Coalition, one of eight New Hampshire groups calling themselves “Sanctuary Communities.”

“We are people from many walks of life and probably a variety of political persuasions,” said Philip Kaifer, representing the Manchester and Merrimack Region Sanctuary Community. “But our common concern is the fear we have because federal police are interfering with life as we know it,” he continued. “Our Granite State motto is ’Live Free or Die,’ but we no longer feel so free when we see secret agents—often masked and with no ID —whisking people off our streets and even disappearing them.”

“We are witnessing news headlines that read like something out of Nazi Germany,” said Bob Baker, a former Air Force Intelligence officer who lives in Columbia, near the Canadian border. “We cannot sit by while lawlessness and indecency are being visited upon us by masked agents sent into our communities from Washington.”

“Let’s talk about due process,” Baker, a retired lawyer, said later in the news conference. “Every single human being in this country, all they have to be is on the soil, is entitled to due process. That means, in simplest terms, the right to know what the charges are against you when you’re arrested. That’s not happening.” When people don’t even know what they’re being charged with, they can’t defend themselves, he said. “Just think about that. That’s wrong,” Baker said.

The Sanctuary Communities groups drew critical responses from Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte before their news conference had ended, and in press releases from other Republicans later on Tuesday.

In a statement headlined, “New Hampshire is NOT a Sanctuary for Criminals,” Ayotte said, “Threats to law enforcement or efforts to obstruct them will not be tolerated in New Hampshire. We are not a sanctuary for criminals who have come into this country illegally, and the law I signed earlier this year reinforces that. If you disrupt law enforcement activity, you will be prosecuted.”

The Sanctuary Communities project was born several months ago in New Hampshire’s North Country, where J. Larry Brown and Judi Garfinkel, residents of Lancaster, circulated a concept paper stating, “Any community—groups of concerned people from nearby towns, churches and institutions—can informally come together and declare themselves a Sanctuary Community, ready to provide assistance to people whose lives and well-being are threatened by federal security forces. Individual Sanctuary Communities can simply announce themselves publicly and organize to take steps they choose.” The idea was to spark a grassroots upsurge of groups openly objecting to ICE abuses and providing support for those harmed by them.

“History is clear,” they wrote, “that the only way to thwart growing authoritarian rule is for common people to speak out and resist. The courts alone cannot do it. The media alone cannot do it. Masses of American citizens rising up to oppose heavy-handed tactics is the way to salvage our democracy and to highlight the rule of law.”

From there, Brown and Garfinkel created a website to promote the concept and encourage activist groups to sign up. At this point, New Hampshire has eight self-designated Sanctuary Communities: North Country, Mt. Washington Valley and Lakes Region, Concord and Capitol Region, Manchester and Merrimack Region, Monadnock, Plymouth Area, Seacoast, and Sunapee/Upper Valley.

The Sanctuary Communities concept received a boost in August when former Labor Secretary Robert Reich promoted it on his Substack newsletter, calling it “an important way to fight Trump fascism.”

Brown said they have received hundreds of inquiries from other states, but at this point, only groups in New Hampshire are listed on their website. “The nice thing about this is that we’re not asking people to join our parade. We’re simply saying, create Sanctuary Communities, but do them in your own way,” Brown said. According to the website, “The Sanctuary Community movement is not an organization and has no leader. It is an idea around which people can organize themselves, creating groups from towns and communities in an area that the participants define.”

The Monadnock Immigrant Solidarity Collaborative defines itself as “a network of people in the southwest corner of New Hampshire, some of us immigrants, some of us allies, who support our immigrant neighbors. We believe immigrants enrich and strengthen our communities through their hard work, wisdom and culture. Our communities are welcoming places and we intend to keep them that way.”?

Any group can declare itself a sanctuary community, the website says, by “organizing a group of 6-10 people from different cities and towns in your area.” Next, a new group should write a statement of purpose, give themselves a name, decide what actions they will take, publicize their existence, and hold meetings to plan and evaluate its actions. “Each Sanctuary Community across the nation can operate on its own but in conjunction with sister Communities as national momentum and news coverage builds.”

New Hampshire Sanctuary Communities represented at the press conference say they will engage in activities such as monitoring and videotaping ICE raids; providing witness information to state and national media and local law enforcement; informing houses of worship, veterans groups, health facilities and schools about heavy-handed ICE actions; and writing letters and placing ads to oppose police-state tactics that threaten legal immigrants, neighbors and fellow citizens.

Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer from Albany, New Hampshire, who is part of the Mount Washington Valley and Lakes Region group, called for a pushback against “efforts to lay the infrastructure for the authoritarian state and terror regime on our own soil.”

“At the beginning of 2025, there was just one ICE detention center in New Hampshire, at the Strafford County Jail,” she said. “In March, the federal prison in Berlin became the second. Now ICE is trying to negotiate with three more counties in our state to use their jails to incarcerate our neighbors. We must push back in Rockingham, Merrimack and Hillsborough County, and any/everywhere else.”

Chapman cited the example of Wells, Maine, where the town has just revoked a 287-G cooperation agreement with ICE, as an example for New Hampshire jurisdictions to follow.

The group cautions against engaging in any illegal activity, such as physically interfering with ICE operations, but says videotaping ICE agents is lawful. “It is anticipated that as the number of Sanctuary Communities grows across the nation, the Administration will threaten and intimidate us. It’s a sign of success, don’t let that stop us,” they say.

State Senator Bill Gannon and Representative Joe Sweeney, both Republicans, released statements as well. “Across New Hampshire, local police departments are working closely with federal officials to enforce the law and keep Granite Staters safe. We have seen the consequences of Democrats’ continual support for open border policies, and we will never have Sanctuary Cities in New Hampshire,” said Gannon, who was the prime sponsor of a bill outlawing “Sanctuary Cities.”

“The ban on Sanctuary Cities is the law of the land,” said House Deputy Majority Leader Sweeney. “We will not allow activists to skirt the law to create open-border policies in New Hampshire.”

The Sanctuary Community groups are well aware of the law. Noting in a Q&A handout distributed at the news conference that Ayotte had recently signed a “Sanctuary Cities” prohibition, the group said, “The Governor’s action pertains to municipalities like cities, towns and counties but it does not pertain to individual citizens. We have a First Amendment right to speak and to organize Sanctuary Communities. We do not work for the Governor.”

In response to the governor’s news release, Megan Chapman said it is ICE that is violating the law and the Constitution. “We do want to be a sanctuary in which people’s rights are upheld and the Constitution is upheld, and that’s what we’re standing for.”

“There’s nothing that we talked about today that is in violation of any New Hampshire or federal law,” Chapman added. “In fact, what we’re trying to do is uphold the Constitution, uphold its guarantees, uphold the rights that are afforded to the people, and make sure that those are protected against a lot of policies and practices that are happening now in violation of those rights.”

“For many of us, this is about answering to a higher law, a law that that calls us to care for the vulnerable, to push back against state sponsored violence and persecution,” Maggie Fogarty commented.

“We’re going step by step,” Larry Brown said as the news conference closed. “This is what citizen movements are about. They grow and they take turns here and there. We don’t know where this is going.”

Success is by no means assured, Brown said. “This is truly the David and Goliath moment in our history. But let us all get organized. Let us work together and see what we can do.”",https://indepthnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bob-Baker-speaking-at-Sanctuary-Communities-news-conference-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:57:17.186494

The facility quickly drew immense criticism for its inhumane conditions and treatment of detainees.

Though Alligator Alcatraz is currently shut down due to environmental and moral concerns, the Trump administration’s use of it as a model for expanding detention capacity across the country is extremely concerning. Reports described the center as having contaminated food, floors flooded with sewage water and overcrowded cells resembling cages, according to AP News.

This precedent reflects a disregard for human rights and normalizes mistreatment under the guise of immigration control. The situation highlights a distinct lack of empathy from Trump’s administration and other officials, as they easily cross other humans’ boundaries in this facility.

Additionally, detainees were denied the opportunity to speak to lawyers, family or friends, according to NBC News. They were effectively denied one of America’s most fundamental rights: access to a fair justice system.

The detention center is oppressive toward immigrants who deserve equal and just treatment. Even the most basic standards of human decency are ignored, as if immigrants deserve fewer rights than any other citizen does. Everyone, including immigrants, should reserve the ability to possess human rights, no matter their origin.

In the midst of it all, the government’s reaction toward public criticism is offensive. Its complete disregard for the public’s opinions shows a disinterest toward serving the people of America, which should be one of their top priorities.

Trump’s unprofessionalism was shown clearly as he joked that detainees would have to “learn how to run from alligators,” according to CNN. Instead of understanding the cruel conditions they forced the detainees of Alligator Alcatraz into, the administration ridiculed them.

To prevent more unjust facilities from being built, Americans must stand up and hold government leaders accountable, demanding humane treatment for all people, regardless of their immigrant status. The same goes for officials, whose silence makes them complicit in the moral wrongdoings of Trump’s administration.

Similarly, the government must take responsibility and shut down existing facilities with inhumane conditions. It has a duty to ensure that detention centers, or any other facility, meet basic human rights.

And in a nation that prides itself on being a country of immigrants, forcing people to suffer because of their background is deceitful. These centers take away dignity, separate families and reduce people to less than human.

Americans can not claim to value the right to freedom while tolerating this kind of abuse. Ending these facilities is not just about policy, but about deciding what kind of country we want to be.",https://hhsepitaph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alligatoralcatrazillustration.png,N,,2025-10-28 22:21:08.297040

“Our interfaith leaders who are present here today are doing just that, and they’ve been doing that.","What's at stake:

Advocates and interfaith leaders gathered outside the Fresno ICE Processing Center to denounce racial profiling and detentions of immigrants attending required appointments with no criminal record.

On Tuesday morning, around 40 community members and faith leaders gathered outside the Fresno U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Processing Center for public prayer and “moral witness” as local detentions continue to rise.

Faith in the Valley, along with clergy from Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Indigenous, and other traditions, also held a parallel interfaith vigil outside the Stockton ICE Processing Center simultaneously with the Fresno rally.

Some local interfaith leaders emphasized the challenges faced by immigrants and Indigenous communities in Fresno and the broader Central Valley, describing these struggles as “permanently intertwined and interlinked.”

“We have to stand up against ICE and its unjust and inhumane treatment of our immigrant sisters and brothers,” Hajj Reza Nekumanesh, executive director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Fresno said. “And we have to stand up against the genocide of all indigenous peoples, and in particularly of the Palestinians, because all of these struggles, sisters and brothers, and all of our victories, are permanently intertwined and interlinked with one another.”

Faith leaders spoke out against ICE raids in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and numerous other communities, highlighting repeated violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The leaders condemned these detentions as civil rights violations, which affect both U.S. citizens and undocumented workers. They also raised concerns about racial-profiling, violent arrests, prolonged detentions without access to legal counsel, and deportations to third-party countries, such as South Sudan, where people face indefinite imprisonment, torture, and even death.

Fresnoland has previously reported that immigrants attending required appointments at the Fresno U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office, are being detained during or after their visits — despite having no criminal records and maintaining current paperwork.

Fresnoland also reported that immigrants attending required appointments related to their permanent residence status at the Fresno U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office were detained during or after their visits—despite having no criminal records and maintaining current paperwork.

Earlier, in June, two undocumented immigrants were taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents during an ICE-led operation outside Fresno’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) office, reflecting a practice seen in several states.

ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have increased by 58% during the first seven months of President Donald Trump’s administration compared to the same period the previous year, according to The Fresno Bee.

At the vigil Tuesday, advocates raised concerns about California’s newest and largest detention center, a 2,560-bed facility that opened in late August in California City’s Antelope Valley. They cited reports of poor conditions, alleged mistreatment by staff, and the fact that CoreCivic has not yet received approval for its operating permits.

‘Racialized targeting’

Nekumanesh called on interfaith clergy to uphold “consistency, consistency, consistency” in defending immigrant rights, fighting police brutality, addressing the genocide in Palestine, and standing against other instances where human rights are being denied.

Other faith leaders, including Rev. Akiko Miyake-Stoner of the United Japanese Christian Church, drew on their personal histories to highlight the parallels between current immigration detentions in Fresno and the city’s past.

She noted that the Fresno Fairgrounds served as a temporary detention facility, the Fresno Assembly Center, from May to October 1942, where over 5,000 Japanese Americans, many from Central California, were held during World War II, describing the similarity as “eerily familiar.”

“One doesn’t have to look hard to see the parallels with today’s ICE raids done with such brutality and without due process,” Miyake-Stoner. “Both rely on racialized targeting that singles people out by appearance, language or national origin rather than individual guilt. Both depend on sweeping executive and bureaucratic power that suspends ordinary protections and normalizes detention. Both leave families separated, lives disrupted and communities carrying intergenerational trauma.”

Rev. Madeleine Guekguezian of the United Methodist Church of Merced, an Armenian Armenian American and descendant Armenian Genocide survivors, reflected on U.S. immigration policy, emphasizing that enforcement has often targeted people based on race rather than legal status.

She highlighted how undocumented immigrants are subjected to inhumane detention and removal from their communities, framing those who look different from the white-skinned Anglo majority in the U.S. as threats rather than as fellow human beings.

“The Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II had once said, ‘justice is a gift from God, lack of justice is a sin against God.’ I carry that with me,” Guekguezian said. “For those standing in line for ICE processing, for check ins, my prayer is that justice and relief comes to you as soon as it may be through the action of the people and the repentance of our leaders, but it will not be soon enough.”

How to build a first line of defense

Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, Faith in the Valley’s Watch Network program manager, said she struggles to speak to people who think it’s acceptable for families to be torn apart and denied due process. She emphasized that caring for neighbors should be a basic value learned from childhood.

“They’re dragging people out of their homes, out of their cars and out from public spaces in front of their families because of where they were born, not because of whatever crap they made up or discovered after,” Zaragoza-Yáñez said. “Where’s the due process? No, really, where is the due process? This isn’t acceptable.”

Zaragoza-Yáñez explained that the Watch Network empowers the community by educating people about their rights, accompanying them to check-ins or court appearances, and preparing families for potential incidents. She described the program as the community’s first line of defense, operating across eight Central Valley counties to respond to the tactics used by ICE.

“We keep our community safe by adding our little grain of sand into the bigger picture,” Zaragoza-Yáñez said. “Our interfaith leaders who are present here today are doing just that, and they’ve been doing that. They have bared witness to the atrocities that are being committed against our communities, they’re standing strong against any dehumanization of them, and their efforts are the embodiment of what it means to accompany someone to bear witness to what’s happening.”

That sense of shared responsibility also resonated with local community members in attendance. Jackie Pierson shared with Fresnoland that, as a white person whose “Christian faith is tied to the most marginalized,” she strives to leverage her privilege by volunteering with watch networks and by listening to and walking alongside her neighbors.

While attending the No Kings protests, Sylvia Valdez, a community member invited by an interfaith leader from On Ramps Covenant Church, told Fresnoland that the narrative seems to be shifting, with more white people showing up in solidarity with the communities most directly affected by the actions of Trump’s administration.

Valdez said she wasn’t sure what to expect from the morning’s vigil but ultimately felt “unity, peace, and God doing something powerful” through the gathering.

“I was able to look inward and grieve what’s happening,” Valdez said. “I thought about the needs of the people.”",https://fresnoland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1347-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:01:42.515663

""Me and my dad had nothing to hide,"" the Houston teenager said at a news conference Monday. ""We were confused, so we just pulled over in a parking lot.""

According to Arnoldo, the two cars then blocked them in, and masked law enforcement officers — whom he claimed did not have identifying badges on their vests — began hitting the windows. Arnoldo said he and his father were scared, so his father decided to drive away.

""That's when me and my dad went [into] fight or flight,"" he said. ""He was trying to protect me. That's what he told me — ‘I'm going to protect you.’ ''

The unmarked cars then followed Arnoldo and his father down Boone Street in Southwest Houston to the Restaurant Depot on Bissonnet Street, where the two got out of the car, according to Arnoldo.

""I ran with my dad, but then they tackled him,"" he said. ""Three of them jumped on him, but when I saw they started choking, kicking, punching, it's when I reacted. I just ran to my dad, and a lady, she grabbed my shirt.""

The Montgomery County Processing Center, which is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told Houston Public Media that Arnulfo Bazan was deported to Mexico on Monday — the same day his son recounted their experience during a news conference organized by FIEL Houston, an immigrant rights nonprofit. The organization reported that Arnulfo was taken to the processing center north of Houston after the Oct. 23 encounter at Restaurant Depot, while Arnoldo said he was returned home after he told the officers he was a minor and U.S. citizen.

The detention center did not provide further details regarding Arnulfo's immigration status or why he was deported. A Houston-based ICE spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the deportation or the Oct. 23 incident involving Arnulfo and his son.

FIEL Houston Executive Director Cesar Espinosa said he fears “more incidents like this can unfold” as federal immigration enforcement ramps up under the administration of President Donald Trump.

“In our beautiful diverse city, we are so worried for our communities and all the families that will be separated and hurt by this administration,” Espinosa said in a statement.

Arnoldo alleged that the officers who confronted him and his father choked him and took his cell phone. He said he believes his phone was taken because he had used it to film the encounter.

“They cover their faces and they don’t act like regular law enforcement or other federal agents,” Manny said.","Angelica Vargas was driving to get coffee near her home in Downey, California, when she saw a disturbing, yet now-familiar sight: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents running down the street, arresting a man who was painting a gas station. Immediately, Vargas moved to action: She pulled over and confronted the officers, using the firm, calm tone she’s learned is effective in situations like these.

“Of course, they got a little bit defensive. But then I started recording for evidence. And I reminded the guy he had rights. I kind of gave the officers a rough time,” Vargas said in a phone interview. Her initial plan was only to assist the detainee and document the officers. But then, seemingly in retaliation, some ICE vehicles remained behind to “box in” Vargas’s car, preventing her from leaving.

“That pissed me off. I mean, they weren’t gonna be there forever, boxing me in,” Vargas recalled. “So when they took off, I said, Let’s go. I have a really fast car. So I gave them a run for their money that day.”

For Vargas, a Mercedes-driving self-described “soccer mom,” that was the start of a new extracurricular: chasing ICE vehicles on the road, and posting the videos on TikTok. Now Vargas is known to her hundreds of thousands of followers—and the tens of millions of people who have watched her content—for her videos with cheeky titles like “Spending Quality Time With ICE.” Posted in time-lapse speed to jaunty Mexican music, Vargas’s videos show ICE vehicles weaving lanes, and in some cases making multiple or illegal U-turns, to avoid her. In one video, Vargas cuts across what appears to be a gas station parking lot to speed up her pursuit.

“I love you taking shortcuts to get back to them that they don’t know about. Guess who’s actually from there,” one user commented. Indeed, the overall effect, as commenters have noted, is like Grand Theft Auto: exhilarating, even heroic.

ICE raids have skyrocketed under the Trump administration, striking fear in immigrant communities. Fueled by a $75 billion funding increase this year, arrests surged in the Los Angeles area, where Vargas lives. Over 2,000 immigrants without criminal records were arrested this summer, the majority from Mexico and Guatemala. Other areas have been hit hard more recently; in Chicago and its suburbs, for instance, federal agents have used tear gas and smashed car windows while carrying out raids.

Raids are designed to inspire fear, with agents frequently wearing masks, seizing students off the streets, and even incorporating theatrical, militarized elements like agents on horseback. “The Trump administration’s goal is to make life as unnavigable, unstable and uncomfortable as possible” for undocumented immigrants, CalMatters reported in August. The effects in the LA area have been palpable. Bus ridership decreased in LA over the summer, and Cal State Los Angeles, which serves working-class communities, allowed students to take classes online for fear of immigration enforcement.

In these conditions of terror, Vargas’s decision to turn the fear back on ICE offers much-needed catharsis for her viewers. “You had them stressing 😂,” commented one user on a June video. “ICE works hard but Angie works harder 😭,” said another. “Do you think they sit around campfires and tell horror stories about you?” another joked.

Vargas’s favorite responses, she said, come from older generations. “There was a girl who reached out to me and told me that her dad was an illegal immigrant, and before his passing, he loved my TikTok page,” she said. “It brightened up his day.”

Vargas did not intend to become a public vigilante. She works by day as a mental health professional and dedicates much of her free time to raising her two daughters, student athletes aged 15 and 16. But times are too dire to stay home, she said. Before the ICE raids, she said, “people were able to do their daily lives, go to Home Depots without having the fear of being detained, or even showing up to their jobs without the fear of being raided by immigration agents. A lot has shifted. We are definitely living under terror.”

Vargas first discovered her superpower—her ability to stand up to ICE—in June, when she got a distressing call from her mother: Vargas’s sister, a US citizen, had gotten stuck at a “super chaotic” ICE raid at a Home Depot in Downey. “There was tear-gassing, fire bombs, a bunch of stuff that, you know, it’s just not normal. On a Saturday morning,” Vargas recalled. “My mom was scared, and I took initiative. I said, ‘Mom, I’m going to go get her.’”

Although ICE had blocked off the parking lot and wasn’t allowing anybody to leave, Vargas drove up to the Home Depot. She managed to push through the barriers and convince the ICE agents to allow her sister to drive out in her truck. “Mind you, she was one of the only people that was allowed to leave. I convinced the federal agents, right? So I’d seen what I could do,” Vargas said. “It really made me see how privileged I am to be a US citizen. Everybody’s told me, like, you carry this confidence in you, even officers respect you. So I’m gonna use that to my advantage and for the community.”

Vargas thinks she is able to get through to ICE agents because she is a US citizen and speaks fluent English. She’s strengthened her communication tactics—she tries to keep it “smart and professional,” having noticed that federal agents don’t respond well to cursing or aggressive questioning. Vargas, a former psych major, also tries to use “reverse psychology tactics” against the agents, trying to “relate to them, get on their level.”

“I feel like a lot of people stay indoors and just watch through a phone,” she said, “when they have the legal status to go out there and make a difference.”

Emboldened by her success at Home Depot, Vargas started keeping track of ICE raids in her community. She uses civilian-run Instagram and TikTok accounts that report ICE raids in the hopes of mobilizing responders. Manny, the 29-year-old community college student behind the Instagram account @LAHoodLove, is one such source.

On a given day, @LAHoodLove blasts a series of potential ICE sightings, often naming streets and posting grainy photos.

Manny, who is also an ICE chaser, was already active in organizing fundraisers for street vendors and leading peaceful protests, including at the Downey Home Depot, which is often hit by raids. Manny said ICE chasers stepped up their tactics because ICE doesn’t play by normal rules. “They cover their faces and they don’t act like regular law enforcement or other federal agents,” Manny said. “I call them kidnappers, because they’re wearing masks. No plates, no badge number. They’re just grabbing, pulling out guns. This is worse than cartel. They take you, and you disappear.”

Vargas and Manny, like many organizers, took advantage of the fact that ICE, at least in the early months of the Trump administration, was disorganized. Manny’s first time chasing ICE was in February. He said he sensed that the agents were nervous. “I already had an idea that ICE was going to hire contractors. So I just figured, OK, they haven’t done this in a while, so it’s gonna be a little off,” Manny said. “So once I approached them, they were shook because I was recording them. I had my phone right in their faces, and I was like, who are you guys? Where you work?”

The agents, Manny said, claimed to be probation officers, but the effect on the people they were detaining was confusion and terror. Indeed, ICE’s practice of wearing masks during raids earned swift public pushback and is facing legal and policy challenges.

Ad Policy

Vargas said ICE is getting more effective now—but so too is resistance. “They’re scared to be ambushed by civilians, especially now, since we’re all well connected,” Vargas said.

Social media, Vargas said, has been a “huge blessing” for community members to coordinate their response, whether that is ICE chasing, documenting raids, or informing detainees of their rights. It also helps build morale. There are the viral videos of mass confrontations with ICE and the Border Patrol, from LA to Portland to Chicago. But there are also people standing up on a smaller scale. Social media is filled with choppy videos filmed by bystanders bearing witness to raids.

In July, the Los Angeles Times compiled a list of social media videos that showcase civilians intervening in local ICE arrests. From cars honking in warning as Border Patrol trucks enter a parking lot, to a woman screaming, “What’s wrong with you?” at agents arresting a taco vendor, to a woman commenting, “Bitches,” as she records agents making arrests at a Home Depot, social media bears witness to a tapestry of quiet and overt resistance.

Nonetheless, ICE chasing carries significant risks. Manny said that “unfortunately” he has never consulted with a lawyer or gotten legal protection for his ICE chasing; he works alone because he doesn’t want to endanger a passenger if he is detained. Just in case, he switched cars. Vargas, too, said she chases alone: “Nobody knew where I was. Only, like, my best friends had my location.” While she isn’t afraid of detention by ICE since she’s a US citizen, she did initially fear being pulled over by police.

Now that she’s often busy responding to ICE sightings, Vargas’s mother steps in to help take care of her daughters. “They are my number-one supporters,” Vargas said of her family; while she doesn’t bring her daughters on ICE chases for safety reasons, they help charge her phones, batteries, and media equipment, and accompany her to “friendlier, family-oriented protests.” Meanwhile, Vargas’s social media followers sought ways to help. Responding to comments offering to pay for her gas, Vargas set up a GoFundMe page, “Support Angie in Protecting Our Latin Community,” that has raised over $122,000.

To her community, in-person and online, Vargas is a hero. She said she’s always been this kind of person—someone who stands up when things are difficult. This quality she attributes to her father, an ex-professional soccer player, who raised her with privilege in the suburbs but “never let [her] forget she is brown.” She also credited her organizing chops to managing her daughter’s soccer team. Beyond ICE chasing, she stays active in her community through mutual aid efforts and food distributions, and has contemplated running for office in the future.

“It definitely doesn’t come with a manual,” Vargas said of organizing against ICE. “Everything is going to be different. One day you can be helping a person with groceries. The next day, you can be chasing ICE and confronting federal agents.”

These days ICE comes to Downey less often, hopefully a result of ICE-chasing efforts, Vargas said. “I’m not getting as much ICE leads around my city, which is a good thing. But now I have to commute longer in order to do what I was doing. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because it’s not within my comfort zone, like, I don’t know the streets, what freeways I’m at. But I still make an effort to go out there and help out the community.”",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FotoJet-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:17:00.778459

Window-shopping for health plans delayed The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The pressure to end the second-longest federal government shutdown is gaining new urgency this week as millions of Americans face the prospect of losing food assistance, more federal workers miss their first full paycheck and recurring delays at airports snarl travel plans.

The building strain on lawmakers to end the impasse was magnified by the nation’s largest federal employee union, which called on Congress to immediately pass a funding bill and ensure workers receive full pay. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the two political parties have made their point.

“It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship,” said Kelley, whose union carries considerable political weight with Democratic lawmakers.

Still, Democratic senators, including those representing states with many federal workers, did not appear ready to back down. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he was insisting on commitments from the White House to prevent the administration from mass firing more workers. Democrats also want Congress to extend subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act.

“We’ve got to get a deal with Donald Trump,” Kaine said.

But shutdowns grow more painful the longer they go. Soon, with closures lasting a fourth full week as of Tuesday, millions of Americans are likely to experience the difficulties firsthand.

“This week, more than any other week, the consequences become impossible to ignore,” said Rep. Lisa McClain, chair of the House Republican Conference.

Shutdown’s impact is set to grow dramatically

The nation’s 1.3 million active-duty service members are at risk of missing a paycheck on Friday. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ensured they were paid by shifting $8 billion from military research and development funds to make payroll. But it is unclear if the Trump administration is willing — or able — to shift money again.

Larger still, the Trump administration says funding will run out Friday for the food assistance program that is relied upon by 42 million Americans to supplement their grocery bills. The administration has rejected the use of more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits flowing into November. And it says states won’t be reimbursed if they temporarily cover the cost of benefits next month.

WATCH: ‘I don’t see the path for’ Trump 2028 presidential bid, Johnson says

The Department of Agriculture says the contingency fund is intended to help respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Democrats say the decision concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, goes against the department’s previous guidance concerning its operations during a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the administration made an intentional choice not to the fund SNAP in November, calling it an “act of cruelty.”

Will lawmakers find a solution?

At the Capitol, congressional leaders mostly highlighted the challenges many Americans are facing as a result of the shutdown. But there was no movement toward negotiations as they attempted to lay blame on the other side of the political aisle.

“Now government workers and every other American affected by this shutdown have become nothing more than pawns in the Democrats’ political games,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

The House passed a short-term continuing resolution on Sept. 19 to keep federal agencies funded. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of legislative session ever since, saying the solution is for Democrats to simply accept that bill.

But the Senate has consistently fallen short of the 60 votes needed to advance that spending measure. Democrats insist that any bill to fund the government also address health care costs, namely the soaring health insurance premiums that millions of Americans will face next year under plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed

The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday. In past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has allowed Americans to preview their health coverage options about a week before open enrollment.

As of Monday, Healthcare.gov appeared to show 2025 health insurance plans and estimated prices, instead of next year’s options. CMS was expected to temporarily bring back all its workers furloughed during the shutdown, in part to manage the ACA open enrollment period.

Twenty-eight senators, mostly Democrats, signed a letter urging Trump’s administration to let ACA enrollees start previewing next year’s health insurance options on its marketplace website.

Republicans insist they will not entertain negotiations on health care until the government reopens.

“I’m particularly worried about premiums going up for working families,” said Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa. “So we’re going to have that conversation, but we’re not going to have it until the government opens.”

Congressional leaders dig in deeper

Schumer said Republicans would prefer to shut the government down than work with Democrats in preventing massive spikes in their health insurance costs. He said the average American doesn’t want to pay an extra $20,000 a year to cover their health insurance.

“And we Democrats want to solve this crisis right away,” Schumer said. “So lowering health care is not a crazy demand.”

Vice President JD Vance planned to attend a Republican luncheon on Capitol Hill Tuesday. But with President Donald Trump traveling in Asia and congressional leaders dug into their positions, a quick deal appeared unlikely.

Meanwhile, some rank-and-file lawmakers urged colleagues to consider the impact of their standoff on the lives of federal employees and Capitol police officers who have not been paid for weeks.

“We have got to come together, which means we’ve got to talk to one another,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a floor speech urging leaders to stop focusing on who was winning the political fight. “Right now, those that are losing are the American people.”

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs.","WASHINGTON (CN) — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had little to say Tuesday about reports that the Department of Homeland Security purged immigration enforcement chiefs in several U.S. cities as the Trump administration looks to supercharge its mass deportation campaign.

Both Republicans and Democrats were hesitant to weigh in on the staffing shake-up, which would see officials from U.S. Border Patrol replace the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

But at least one lawmaker speculated that the Homeland Security Department made the staffing changes to support what he called the White House’s “unrealistic” deportation quotas.

According to a report from the Washington Examiner, the agency last week removed five ICE field office chiefs and moved them to positions elsewhere in the country. In addition to reassigning the heads of immigration enforcement in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Homeland Security Department also removed ICE chiefs in Phoenix and San Diego.

The administration reportedly plans to replace most of the ousted immigration heads with senior staff from Border Patrol, though in Philadelphia, the vacant ICE role will be filled by an official from Homeland Security Investigations.

While the move to replace top ICE officials with Border Patrol — which has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under its chief, Gregory Bovino — is unprecedented, lawmakers largely claimed Tuesday that they didn’t have enough information to take a firm stance on the issue.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a senior Republican member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, declined to comment to Courthouse News. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, another GOP lawmaker on the homeland security panel, said that he had seen reporting about the purges but that he didn’t “know enough” about the situation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed ignorance of the ICE leadership purge during a news conference Tuesday morning, telling Courthouse News that he had only just learned about the reports. He added that “some of these things get mis-portrayed.”

Democrats were similarly reticent to offer their thoughts. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told Courthouse News that he had not yet been briefed and declined to offer any additional input.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat who also sits on the Homeland Security committee, posited that the staffing shake-up at ICE’s field offices was thanks to the immigration agency’s failure to meet the Trump administration’s “completely unrealistic” deportation quotas.

White House adviser Stephen Miller has long demanded that ICE arrest as many as 3,000 immigrants a day, or 1 million per year.

“This kind of executive action simply shows the moral bankruptcy of their policies,” said Blumenthal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, did not directly respond to reports of the purge at ICE, saying instead that Americans were “understandably horrified” at the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“It’s our hope that, if there’s going to be a change in personnel, it’s actually to enact a more humane approach, rather than what we’ve seen in community after community in the country,” said Jeffries.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs. The agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, told Courthouse News in a statement Tuesday that it had “no personnel changes to announce right now.”

“This is one team, one fight,” McLaughlin wrote. “President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

A spokesperson for the Border Patrol union did not return a request for comment.

News that Border Patrol officials may be taking over for ICE in several major cities comes as Bovino on Tuesday was dressed down by a federal judge over his failure to comply with a court order blocking federal agents from deploying tear gas and other riot control weapons against protesters, journalists and other bystanders in Chicago.

The judge demanded that Bovino, who has personally participated in the federal crackdown on the Windy City and has himself deployed tear gas on demonstrators, appear before her daily to report new incidents. Bovino admitted to the court that he did not use a body-worn camera and agreed to begin wearing one.

The Trump administration has in recent weeks sent federal agents and National Guard troops into several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The White House has framed the move as an effort to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. Some federal courts have ruled that the president’s deployment of National Guard troops violates federal law.

According to recent statistics, more than 70% of people held by ICE have no prior criminal convictions.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-28 22:21:28.375460

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said the administration had “no personnel changes to announce at this time,” but praised President Donald Trump and his team for “delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

It comes as Border Czar Tom Homan says he’s working with White House adviser Stephen Miller to increase the pace of deportations.

“We need to continue prioritizing public safety threats,” Homan told NewsNation. “Worst first but prioritization doesn’t mean everyone else is off the table. If you are here illegally, you ARE NOT off the table.”

Border Patrol has been carrying out the majority of the sweeping raids that generally lead to protests at the direction of Chief Gregory Bovino, who appeared in court Tuesday over allegations that he threw tear gas canisters during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

Border Patrol agents also carry out targeted enforcement operations. By comparison, ICE officers generally stick to one target after they conduct research.

Earlier this month, Bovino told NewsNation that Border Patrol operations are “all legal, ethical and moral.”

Fox News reports that the change in staffing comes from competing factions within deportation enforcement, with Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons squared off against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Bovino.

Sources believe that ICE’s current enforcement approach is not producing the number of arrests Trump wants, but Bovino’s broader methods appear to be what the administration is after.

“We are going to go throughout Chicago with reckless abandon — professionally, legally, ethically and morally — and arrest all illegal alien gang members that we can get our hands on,” Bovino told NewsNation.

Over months of conversations with NY1, former immigration judges recommended comparing how many judges had active Webex video channels now versus the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency in January.

What You Need To Know

NY1 analysis shows a steep drop in immigration judges with active Webex channels since the beginning of the second Trump administration

Former judges told NY1 that no longer having a Webex link means the judge is on leave, took a buyout, retired or got fired

The Trump administration announced a plan to hire hundreds of temporary judges across the country

A former immigration judge in New York City, fired by the Trump administration, raised concerns about how prepared the temporary judges will be

They told NY1 the missing links had one of four potential outcomes: the judge could have taken a leave, taken a buyout, retired or been fired.

When NY1, using examined the government web pages from January 19, 2025 — the day before Donald Trump’s inauguration — compared to October 16, 2025, there were 15 judges whose names had disappeared over the course of the year.

One of those judges was Carmen Maria Rey Caldas, who had been a judge at 26 Federal Plaza until late this summer.

“It was an email,” she said from her Brooklyn apartment, describing how she found out her fate. “It was sent at 4:07 p.m.”

She said there was no reason given for her termination.

For the first time since 2015, according to data provided to NY1 by the U.S. Department of Justice, the number of immigration judges has dropped.

In that year, there were 254 immigration judges across the country per Department of Justice data, when the immigration case backlog was 456,216, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

However, in the decade since then, the backlog of cases has exploded to more than 3.4 million, as the number of judges reached a peak of 735.

In 2023, there was a federal report provided to Congress about the backlog of immigration cases and how hiring more immigration judges could impact that statistic.

At that point, the backlog of immigration cases nationwide was under 2 million. The number of immigration judges sat at 649, according to the report filed by the Congressional Research Service, which is a nonpartisan research agency that provides reports to Congress.

If 1,000 more judges had been hired at the time, that would have led to no backlog in about five years, according to the analysis done at the time. If no judges were hired, it would lead to a backlog of more than 3.1 million by 2033.

It took less than two years, rather than the predicted 10 years, to blow past that number nationally, however.

The backlog of cases means some respondents in immigration courts have hearings set for the next decade, according to immigration lawyers NY1 has interviewed in recent years.

On Jan. 19, there were 721 immigration judges across the country. Before a recent hiring announcement by the Department of Justice, at last count, it was at 575.

The remaining judges can face a culture of fear, according to Caldas.

“That is no way to run a court,” she said to NY1.

In the latest budget bill, Congress authorized the DOJ to have a total of as many as 800 immigration judges, and late this summer, the Trump administration announced a plan to hire up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary judges.

On Friday, the administration announced a new class of 36 immigration judges, about 70% of them temporary.

One permanent and one temporary hire will hear cases in New York City courtrooms starting this month.

This new class of judges will bring the total to more than 600 again, for the first time in a few months, according to the NY1 review of active Webex video channels.

Since the beginning of the administration, there has been a 15% drop in judges across the country, and in New York City, nearly mirroring the national average, has seen a 16% decrease, according to NY1’s analysis.

Those percentage drops include last week’s hiring announcement.

If the Trump administration fills all the temporary judicial positions, on top of the permanent ones currently on staff, it would represent the largest total number of judges nationwide.

The 600 potential temporary ones, however, will be reevaluated every six months, before a decision is made on whether to renew their position or not, according to the Department of Justice memo from this summer.

“I think they’re being set up to fail,” Caldas said in her interview about the temporary judges, which was done weeks before the new hires were announced.

She said immigration law can be complex, and judges are often ruling on cases at the moment, not having time to research decisions for weeks on cases where the stakes can be incredibly high.

“A wrong move can result in someone’s death. If you deport someone to a country where their life is in danger, that person could very well die,” she said.

A Department of Defense spokesperson told NY1 the agency “is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.”

NY1 followed up by asking what qualities make a Department of Defense employee qualified versus unqualified.

“We don’t have anything additional to provide on this,” she said.

In a federal document outlining the new policy, the Department of Justice indicated it will look for “the most qualified individuals overall with primary weight given to an applicant’s education and employment history,” and that factors such as judicial, trial or immigration experience will matter.

The DOJ document said the temporary judges will receive the same “comprehensive, continuing training and support” as permanent judges.

But Caldas said she’s not sure if they will have the support team she had, including two clerks who helped with writing decisions and responding to motions.

When NY1 asked the Department of Justice spokeswoman about the plan to support temporary judges, she sent a document that she said included that information.

However, NY1’s review of the file led to nothing specific about staffing for the temporary judges.

More simply, Caldas has a question, at least at her former workplace, 26 Federal Plaza, if the government hires more judges than those who have left in recent months.

“Has anyone even looked at where these people are going to sit? There aren’t enough courtrooms,” she said. “We literally don’t have court space.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/_ERIC_PKG_JUDGES_DROPPING_CG,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:26.530296

WASHINGTON—The federal government has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review two appellate court decisions striking down President Trump’s executive order limiting constitutional birthright citizenship to children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Yesterday, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), in a brief joined by Landmark Legal Foundation, urged the Court to take up the cases.

In its brief, FAIR focuses on the true meaning of an historic Supreme Court case: United States v. Wong Kim Ark, decided in 1898. In that case, the Supreme Court held that, because—and only because—the parents of a man of Chinese ancestry were legally residing in the United States when he was born here, he was a U.S. citizen at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment.

In showing that the Court’s requirement of lawful permission to reside was part of its holding, FAIR sharply parts ways with the view taken by plaintiffs’ attorneys, activist courts, and many academic commentators that the Fourteenth Amendment makes anyone born in the United States whose parents are not diplomats or members of an invading army a citizen. On the contrary, the true reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, explicated in Wong Kim Ark, is that, to be a citizen at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment, one must be born in the United States to parents who, at the time, had permission to reside in the United States. This rule excludes the children of both illegal aliens and tourists from constitutional birthright citizenship, since neither class of aliens has permission to reside here.

Which interpretation is right is clearly an issue of such importance that the Court must resolve it. As the brief puts it:

This Court should grant certiorari to correct a glaring, widespread legal error, committed by both courts below, about the meaning of one of this Court’s central historical precedents. This Court should recognize that it remains bound by this precedent as properly understood, having no strong grounds to overturn it, and accordingly rule for petitioners.

“This holding has been sleeping in the law books, in a case largely mischaracterized in law schools and by academics, for 127 years,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “Yet logic shows that it is there and still binding on the Supreme Court. We hope the Court interprets its prior case rightly, grants review, and upholds Trump’s executive order.”

Not anymore.

Nine months after the Trump administration dramatically stepped up immigration enforcement, many people from other countries are remaining at home for fear of being harassed, arrested or deported, possibly to a county they’ve never known. Instead of seeing their therapist at the clinic, a majority of Esperanza’s clients who speak Spanish are now opting for virtual sessions to avoid venturing outside.

But even at home they can’t function normally, said Ingrid Solares, clinical and health equity director for Adelante Mujeres, an Latino advocacy group that opened the clinic a year ago.

“People have a difficult time concentrating, making decisions, focusing, eating regularly, sleeping regularly,” Solares said.

The administration’s efforts to deport people and its racial profiling are starting to take a deep toll not only on many residents but also on those who serve them, advocates and providers told The Lund Report.

Providers at safety net clinics are bracing for potential raids as federal agents sit in unmarked cars with tinted windows in store parking lots and outside schools. Patients are still showing up for health appointments, but they’re reluctant to see unfamiliar specialists, with some even limiting treatment of severe conditions by their primary care provider.

State officials say they have not shared the personal information of undocumented immigrants with the Trump administration thanks to a pending legal action filed to block federal access. But immigrants who lack residency documents have become increasingly reluctant to sign up for state-paid health care benefits because they’re worried they might become a target — even though Oregon is one of several states offering such care.

The Healthier Oregon program provides free physical, mental and dental care benefits to low-income immigrants whose residency status excludes them from Medicaid, the federally backed health care program for low-income residents.

The number of people enrolled in the program had steadily grown, surpassing 100,000 in December and peaking at more than 107,000 in June, state enrollment figures show. Since then the number has dropped every month and currently stands at about 105,000.

By law, federal money is not supposed to be used for routine health care for undocumented immigrants. The state will cover $900 million to fund the program and use another $300 million in federal dollars to cover emergency and pregnancy care as required by the decades-old Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, EMTALA, according to the Oregon Health Authority.

After enrolling, many were reluctant to take advantage of the benefits and now they’re hesitant to even sign up.

“Even folks who might qualify, there's just a level of fear in signing up for any public benefit program,” said Jennifer Griffith, CEO of One Community Health, which runs clinics in Hood River and The Dalles in Oregon and in White Salmon and Stevenson in Washington.

Avoiding preventative care can lead to more serious conditions later on, requiring costly emergency room visits or worse.

If people don’t get care or if federal rules prevent safety net clinics from providing services, everyone will suffer, said Talbot Eckweiler, communications director for the Oregon Primary Care Association, which represents 34 safety net clinics in the state.

“That's going to cost the taxpayers more money, it's going to lead to worse health outcomes for that individual, and it just makes our populations less healthy, less able to function,” Eckweiler said.

Too soon to tell

Officials said it’s too early to gauge how much the crackdown might be affecting health services for undocumented immigrants. But anecdotally, health experts and advocacy groups say it’s definitely affecting people’s health.

“People are worried; providers are worried,” said Gil Muñoz, CEO of Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center, a safety net health system with six clinics in Washington and Yamhill counties.

“For a population that has a lot of trauma already this just adds another layer of stress,” he said.

Virginia Garcia serves 52,000 people. About 60% speak Spanish or another language as their primary tongue, and nearly as many are on Medicaid or qualify for Healthier Oregon. Muñoz has expected the federal activity to lead to many Spanish speakers canceling appointments, but he said that’s not happened so far.

“The demand is still very strong for the services,” Muñoz said. ”I’ve been impressed that people are still showing up despite concerns that there is more activity in the community.”

He suspects that the continued demand reflects trust in Virginia Garcia, which was established in 1975.

“We think people feel safe coming to Virginia Garcia,” Muñoz said. “But what we’ve heard anecdotally is that people may be more hesitant to go to referral visits.”

One Community Health, founded in 1986, serves over 28,000 patients, and about one-fifth who speak Spanish. Griffith, the CEO, said most patients are continuing to seek care.

“Part of that is we're a rural community,” Griffith said. “There are not a lot of options other than us, and we've been here for a long time. Community members trust us.”

But she said some immigrants on Medicaid or Healthier Oregon have asked whether they should give up the coverage to drop off the official radar.

“Our team so far has really been able to kind of talk folks out of it,” Griffith said.

But advocates, like those at the Oregon Latino Health Coalition, an advocacy group focused on reducing health care inequities, are having a tougher time these days persuading people to take advantage of Healthier Oregon. The nonprofit has three bilingual community health workers educating people in Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties about the program. After getting them signed up, they help people navigate the system.

In the past, they could get people signed up with a phone call or two, said Olivia Quiroz, the coalition’s CEO. Now, it takes longer.

“People are hesitant,” Quiroz said. “They want to know more information.” They have a lot of questions.”

Advocates, providers affected, too

Like many people the coalition helps, Quiroz was born in Mexico. She’s a U.S. citizen but understands the effect the crackdown is having on Latinos who feel they’re a target regardless of their immigration status. Every evening she’s reminded of the enforcement as she drives past the ICE detention center in south Portland on her way home from work.

“Personally, every time I see that corner my stress levels and my anxiety goes up,” Quiroz said. “All of us are feeling it.”

At Clinica Esperanza, Solares had to take a day off recently to regroup. From Guatemala, she said seeing images on the news of federal agents with guns brings back a traumatic memory of being a girl on her father’s shoulders one day and having to run because the police were shooting people.

“I feel scared and anxious and sad and pissed,” she said.

Like her clients, she, too, has felt under stress.

“The other day I went a whole day without drinking water,” Solares said.

As a provider, she’s had to adapt. When patients are traumatized, talk therapy often doesn’t work, she said. Instead, therapists use breathing and other body techniques to help clients loosen up.

The therapists at Clinica Esperanza also make sure patients have a safety plan and key phone numbers in the event a family member is arrested.

She recommends that patients and people in the community join the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition, PIRC, to get trained on how to deal with a potential ICE raid. She said she just joined a mutual aid group in the community and is working after hours to help.

“I have some privilege, and I can use my privilege to help others,” Solares said.

But her main focus is working with patients to keep them engaged.

“Our main goal is not to lose the connection with (our clients) who are afraid,” Solares said.

It’s not yet clear what the long-term impact of the current environment will have on people, but Griffith of One Community Health fears the effects could cause deep harm.

“Mental health is a huge component of overall physical well being,” Griffith said. “I don't think we know yet what the long-term effects are going to be, but I can't imagine they're positive.”

‘More complex issues’

One of the family physicians at One Community Health, Dr. Evan Saulino, said some patients appear to be delaying treatment.

“What I do see is people having a little bit more complex issues when they're coming in,” Saulino said. “They're waiting a little bit. They're waiting to see — ‘Can I wait this out? Maybe it'll just get better.’”

He said a longtime patient, an orchard worker with diabetes, came in recently with a foot problem that Saulino said was potentially limb-threatening.

The clinic referred him to a specialist in Portland, but Saulino said the man didn’t want to go.

“He expressed some reluctance over immigration concerns,” Saulino said. “I don’t know what his status is though.”",https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-10/Clinic%20Esperanza%20hug.jpg?itok=QI3pfeAF,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:33.929184

In July, the Department of Labor (DOL) introduced an extensive plan to reduce regulations affecting various labor protections, including important workplace safety regulations. Officials presented the initiative as an effort to “put American workers and job creators first,” a misleading interpretation of policies that enable employers to jeopardize their workers’ well-being and complicate the process for employees to seek accountability.

This movement toward deregulation indicates a readiness to compromise the health and lives of workers, especially Black and brown workers who are overrepresented in the blue-collar industries that would be impacted, in pursuit of corporate profits. If approved, the far-reaching changes will adversely affect working conditions at construction sites and mines and limit the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while performing inherently dangerous activities.

Loosening regulations that ensure health, safety, and dignity in the workplace will not eliminate outdated or unnecessary regulations. Rather, this plan undermines the fundamental right of employees to have safe and respectable working environments; indicates to employers that taking shortcuts is permissible and that the government will ignore the exploitation and subsequent dismissal of worker safety; and seems aimed at reducing expenses for employers by transferring risks and dangers onto employees.

The Importance of Regulatory Rules

Agencies draft federal rules to implement the specifics of legislation enacted by Congress. Regulations ensure that laws are properly implemented and administered so that workers have meaningful protections. This is especially important given that current labor law already falls short in creating adequate job quality standards. Trump’s deregulatory agenda requires agencies to identify ten regulations to repeal before enacting a single new regulation. This paradigm upholds the false notion that regulations hinder economic growth and burden employers.

Over half of the rules that Trump’s DOL wants to repeal are intended to make workplaces safer for employees. Since the establishment of OSHA, more than 712,000 workers have been saved under the OSH Act, and jobsite deaths have decreased by almost two-thirds, even as the size of the U.S. workforce has more than doubled. OSHA is the only agency that enforces and preserves worker health and safety.

Health and Safety Deregulations

Within this deregulation campaign, DOL intends to revise reporting thresholds and training mandates, and change enforcement priorities and inspection frequencies at OSHA. The twenty-five proposed rules all put worker safety protections at risk. Four of the most concerning are:

General Duty Clause

A proposed change that would limit OSHA’s ability to cite employers under the General Duty Clause for hazards deemed “inherent and inseparable” from certain professions in high-risk sectors is particularly harmful. Employers already have autonomy over what is “essential” to a job and how to establish workplace standards, especially in nonunionized settings. That makes the General Duty Clause one of OSHA’s most effective enforcement weapons to address the countless dangers workers may face, giving it the authority to address significant workplace dangers that are not covered by more focused rules. Without the clause’s vital safeguards, OSHA would be significantly less equipped to respond to developing risks or hold employers accountable for recognized hazards that lie within gaps in current regulations.

COVID-19 Reporting

The administration also intends to terminate OSHA’s independent system for monitoring COVID-related deaths and hospitalizations, as well as explicitly remove COVID-19 emergency reporting guidelines for health care settings from federal regulations. This change would mean that employers must only report the usual criteria for workplace risks, under which companies are only required to record hospitalizations if they occur within 24 hours of the job exposure. Since most COVID-related hospitalizations occur days or even weeks after exposure, returning to OSHA’s baseline reporting standard would essentially remove many workplace-related COVID cases from the record. The elimination of separate COVID-19 reporting also signals a concerning de-prioritization of reporting on the exposure of contagious illnesses, even in medical facilities where reporting is crucial for maintaining the safety of those settings, safeguarding access to care, and averting outbreaks that disproportionately affect those who are already at risk. If implemented, this change will harm workers in nursing facilities, assisted living communities, and home health agencies, as well as in other health care environments such as hospitals and medical offices.

Musculoskeletal Injury Reporting

Another proposal would remove the need for employers to disclose musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), even though these injuries are among the most prevalent and expensive workplace hazards. MSDs are injuries brought on by or made worse by heavy lifting, repetitive motions, poor workplace ergonomics, and other physically taxing jobs that are often not adequately protected by existing OSHA standards.

The vote on Monday paused consideration of the ordinances for six months. It came after a procession of clergy, nonprofit workers, activists and citizens stood before the panel of commissioners to deliver impassioned pleas against them. No one expressed support for the measures during a public comment period.

“You are proposing to penalize Knoxvillians for being good. You would turn food pantries, clinics and shelters into checkpoints and faithful servants into informants,” said Matthew Nance, a Knox County resident.

Nance was among the majority of speakers who cited scripture in opposing the measures.

“You would threaten directors for refusing to betray what Christ commands: to feed the hungry, welcome the stranger and heal the wounded,” he said.

But Commissioner Andy Fox, a cosponsor of the measures, chided many of the members of the public who spoke by name, telling one, “you do not rightly divine the Bible.”

“The people that like to bring up the Bible and say what would Jesus do …first of all the Bible, as I like to put it, is a book of personal piety not public policy,” Fox said.

“Now you can derive values from the Bible that you apply in public situations, but primarily the Bible is the book that is the Gospel message to the world and its primary focus is to draw attention to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the need for repentance,” he said.

The two ordinances were initially introduced by Commissioner Angela Russell, an accountant who said the county should more strictly monitor nonprofits that receive county funds. The ordinances require more stringent audits and detailed reporting of expenditures.

One ordinance would attach the new requirements to nonprofits receiving funding via the county’s hotel tax; the other applies to general funds distributed to nonprofits.

Fox subsequently added a clause to the ordinances requiring nonprofit executive directors to provide sworn statements, subject to penalty of perjury, that no county funding is used to provide services to “any person or persons residing in, staying in, or visiting Knox County while in violation of U.S. immigration laws.”

Knox County issued $1.9 million in grants to charitable foundations through its general fund. The amount distributed to charitable funds through its hotel tax was not immediately available. Altogether, public officials said that the total amount granted to nonprofits is less than 1% of the county’s budget.

In the letter, the lawmakers underscore how for decades, communities across the country have benefited from the CDFI Fund, whose success has been made possible through the dedicated staff who have been essential to carrying out its statutory programs and functions. These public servants have helped CDFIs — including hundreds of community banks, credit unions, and loan funds — navigate rigorous certifications and applications, manage grants, and ensure funds reach the communities that need them most. Despite the Fund’s decades of proven success, the Trump Administration has repeatedly targeted the work of the CDFI Fund this year, delaying and even forcing reapplications for hundreds of millions of dollars in awards that community financial institutions leverage to provide financial access to consumers and small businesses. They go on to warn that firing CDFI staff would be reckless and would threaten the CDFI Fund’s core mission of expanding access to capital, especially to underserved groups and areas that have been historically and systemically shut out by traditional financial institutions.

The letter can be found in its entirety below and here.

”We write to express our deep concern at the attempt by the Trump Administration to unilaterally terminate all of the Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) staff as it pursues illegal “reductions in force” during the government shutdown. The CDFI Fund and the community financial institutions they serve are an essential and vital source of capital and financial services to underserved communities across the United States that traditional financial institutions historically don’t serve as well, including in urban and rural communities.

“For more than 30 years, across Republican and Democratic Administrations, the CDFI Fund has been a bipartisan success, providing grants, technical assistance, and other support to community financial institutions across the country that are certified as CDFIs. During the pandemic, Democrats and Republicans worked with the Trump Administration to ensure CDFIs could serve as a lifeline to consumers and small businesses in underserved communities across the country. For example, after the first round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans went to preferred customers of the largest banks, Congress set aside $60 billion for CDFIs and other community lenders to help deploy PPP to truly small businesses in underserved communities. Congress subsequently worked with the Trump Administration to provide $12 billion in capital investments and grants for CDFIs and minority depository institutions (MDIs). These funds are estimated to boost lending by at least $130 billion to underserved communities over the next decade.

“Today, there are 1,376 community financial institutions certified as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that are located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. These include 352 community banks, 444 credit unions, and 567 loan funds.6 Last year, CDFI Fund recipients financed more than 109,000 businesses, provided funding for more than 45,000 affordable homes, and originated almost $24.5 billion in loans and investments. CDFIs are vital to Main Street prosperity. Moreover, the New Markets Tax Credit program implemented by the CDFI Fund has contributed more than $81 billion in tax credit awards to projects that include investment in manufacturing facilities, educational centers, and hospitals. The sudden, inexplicable loss of this critical funding conduit could mean a decades-long recovery for impacted communities, as they seek to replace CDFI Fund dollars that are typically leveraged more than 8 times by private funding.

“Experienced, knowledgeable CDFI Fund staff support certified CDFIs, which are often very small community lenders, in completing the CDFI recertification and program award application processes. Furthermore, before the shutdown, the Trump Administration needlessly held up the delivery of hundreds of millions of dollars of previously appropriated CDFI awards, and then issued an updated application, forcing applicants to potentially adjust their application within a short period without having staff on hand to help. We ask that all applicants have a fair opportunity to access these funds. Going forward, without experienced staff being available to answer questions and help these institutions navigate the recertification process that must be completed by year-end, delays may cause investors to look to other opportunities, undermining the public private partnership that has supported so many communities gain financial access to credit.

“The CDFI Fund and CDFIs it supports have contributed for more than 30 years to addressing many difficult investment challenges that other financial institutions lack the capacity or ability to resolve. As some of us have recently noted, this reckless attempt to fire all of the public servants who administer the CDFI Fund flies in the face of what leaders of the Trump Administration have acknowledged about the importance of CDFIs. The outcry of alarm at this attempted gutting of the CDFI Fund and the show of support for the work of the CDFI Fund has been broad and bipartisan.

“While this misguided move has been rightfully challenged in court, it is imperative that you not wait to take action to rescind this unlawful attempt to undermine the CDFI Fund immediately. Doing so will help ensure that CDFIs and the communities that depend on them across the country will continue to thrive now and, in the years, to come.”",https://escobar.house.gov/images/facebook-meta-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:38.999228

“We appropriated that money for this purpose. The White House must spend it,” she added. “And what they are doing right now, blocking these funds from going out, is illegal.”

At issue is more than $5 billion in the SNAP contingency pool, which Congress created to fund the low-income nutrition program in the event of emergencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees SNAP, had initially said the administration is legally obligated to pay SNAP benefits in the event of a shutdown.

But last week, the department reversed course, saying the contingency fund is reserved for emergencies like natural disasters, not the current shutdown, which it blamed on Democrats. In that light, the agency said, it’s not withholding the money that would be illegal, but spending it.

“The contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,” the USDA said in a memo.

The cost to fund full SNAP benefits through the month of November is estimated to be almost $8 billion. Withholding the funds would affect more than 40 million low-income people, including roughly 16 million children, 8 million seniors and 1.2 million veterans.

Democrats dispute the USDA’s legal argument, saying the contingency fund is designed for situations like the shutdown. They’re invoking the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limited the president’s powers to spend funds in ways inconsistent with Congress’s designs.

“The Trump administration has the appropriated funds, and legal authority, to fully fund SNAP in November — plain and simple,” said Rep. Angie Craig (Minn.), the senior Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. “They are refusing to follow the law. And they are cutting food assistance when there are ample funds available.”

Also on Tuesday, 25 states led by Democrats sued the Trump administration, similarly contending that it is legally obligated to spend the SNAP contingency funds.

Democrats are pointing out that the administration has recently found funding for other favored projects, including $40 billion to bail out Argentina’s flailing economy, $300 million for a new White House ballroom and $170 million for new private jets for top officials at the Homeland Security Department. If the administration wanted to fund SNAP, they contend, it would do so.

“With the snap of a finger, that money can be released and get to people who need it,” DeLauro said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/delaurorosa_072225gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-28 20:00:57.530311

The Trump presidency has been a zenith of this xenophobic fervour, pathologising immigration as an existential threat to American identity.","The arrival of Columbus in the New World marked the beginning of a long history of human migration, driven by the universal quest for survival, hope and dignity. Yet, in a grotesque inversion of history, contemporary politics in the United States, particularly under the Trump administration, has perversely transformed immigration into a toxic battleground of fear, exclusion and ideological warfare. By erasing this brutal history, successive governments in the United States have perpetuated a myth of exceptionalism, even as it denies the humanity of those seeking refuge on its shores.

As schoolchildren, many of us were asked to write an essay on the theme, “What if Columbus had not discovered America?” Understandably, the very framing of this question is steeped in colonial ideology that assumes that Columbus’s landing was a historic necessity, a great leap for civilisation rather than what it actually was. Our answers, drawn from textbooks that valorised explorers and erased victims, inevitably celebrated Columbus’s courage and navigational daring. We were taught to admire the predator, never to mourn the prey.

The destruction of vibrant civilisations

But what if Columbus had not landed in the Bahamas in 1492? What if the Arawaks, the generous, peace-loving people he first encountered, had been allowed to live in peace? What if the Americas had been allowed to evolve on their own terms, with their own cultures, languages, and knowledge systems flourishing unmolested? The Iroquois Confederacy, for instance, had developed a sophisticated democratic system that inspired elements of the U.S. Constitution, though that influence is often buried or denied. These were not “primitive” societies awaiting rescue. They were civilisations with libraries, roads and astronomy, all destroyed in the name of gold and god.

From the early waves of European colonisation in the Americas and Africa to the apartheid regimes of South Africa, migration has not merely been a matter of movement. It has also been a means of conquest, expansion and domination. Settler colonial projects thrived through the forceful displacement and systematic downgrading of native populations, manifesting in overt and subtle ways through systems of oppression that are deeply ingrained in societal structures that perpetuate racial disparity and injustice. The U.S., frequently celebrated as an ideal for the “tired, poor, huddled masses”, was itself forged through the expurgation of native peoples and the abuse of enslaved labour. By denying entry to migrants, powerful nations conveniently obscure their own complicity in creating the conditions that drive people to flee.

The intricate dynamics of historical memory and its distortion are starkly illustrated in the U.S.’s approach to immigration and counter-terrorism. Let us for a moment go back to the distressing example of “Geronimo”, the code word said to have been used in the 2011 mission (“Operation Neptune Spear”) to eliminate Osama bin Laden. By appropriating the name of the legendary Apache leader, Geronimo, the U.S. military inadvertently highlighted its historical amnesia. Geronimo was a complex figure, a warrior who resisted Mexican and U.S. military forces, seeking to preserve Apache sovereignty and way of life. Labelling him a terrorist overlooks the nuances of his struggle and reduces it to simplistic binaries.

But this is no isolated misstep, for it is symptomatic of a deeper sickness in the dominant historical narrative; a narrative that begins in 1492 with the mythic arrival of Christopher Columbus. This moment is still described in textbooks, museums and mindless school rhymes as the “discovery” of America. The truth, of course, is far more brutal. Columbus did not discover a new world. He invaded one, and that invasion set in motion one of the most ferocious chapters in human history. Columbus’s arrival heralded not discovery, but genocide. The devastation was total.

What mainstream historians miss

Mainstream historians seldom dwell on the mass enslavement, the sexual violence or the cultural annihilation. To question Columbus’s legacy is to invite accusations of being “anti-American” or “revisionist”. But if revision means restoring truth to the record, then revisionism is a moral obligation. The problem is not that we remember too little; it is that we remember too selectively.

The Columbus myth, far from being a harmless fable, is the ideological blueprint for centuries of colonial expansion, white supremacy and racial capitalism. It legitimises the pillaging of the Americas, the enslavement of Africans, and the later interventions of American imperialism under the guise of spreading “freedom”. The mentality that justified the extermination of the Arawaks is the same that rationalises drone strikes today.

Fast-forward to the 21st century, and the brutal calculus of migration remains unchanged: flee war-torn Syria, economically ravaged Venezuela, or climate-ravaged sub-Saharan Africa, and you will be met with suspicion and hostility at the borders of the Global North. The Trump presidency has been a zenith of this xenophobic fervour, pathologising immigration as an existential threat to American identity. The border wall, family separations, and the Muslim ban are not just policy aberrations but ideological manifestos that codify cruelty and exclusion. These measures are not pragmatic responses to complex issues; they are declarations of war on the most vulnerable.

Moreover, the resurgence of exclusionary nationalism, a hallmark of Trump-era politics, has biased the discourse around belonging and citizenship. It designates the immigrant not as a fellow human in search of security but as an economic burden, a cultural contagion or a national security risk. What emerges, then, is a moral paradox of nations founded on violent migration and colonisation but now busy erecting moral and legal barriers to those seeking refuge.

If settler colonialism is justified under the banner of “civilising mission”, why should today’s migration be framed illegitimate? The glaring disparity between the revered pioneers of the past and the vilified migrants of today lays bare the insidious role of race, power and historical amnesia in shaping the immigration narrative.

A fundamental aspiration

Clearly, the future of immigration policy hinges on our willingness to confront the darkest chapters of our past and the brutal realities of our present. We need to excavate the buried subtexts of empire, capitalism and racial domination that continue to shape mobility, and forge a new path forward informed by historical reckoning and a commitment to human dignity. The right to seek safety, to move across borders, is not a privilege to be doled out to the few, but a fundamental human aspiration that must be recognised and protected.

To imagine, therefore, a world in which Columbus had not made landfall is not to indulge in idle fantasy, but to confront the brutal reality of a collective past. It is to consider the possibility of a world unshaped by genocide, a world where Indigenous peoples flourished on their own terms, where empires did not build their foundations on loot and plunder. The truth about history is not a matter of nicety, but a fundamental requirement for justice, accountability, and a future that does not replicate the wrongs of the past.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/opinion/op-ed/d0ue7k/article70213300.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/iStock-1321690745.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:57:20.733964

“Snap benefits are about to end on Saturday,” the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Fox News.","A coalition of more than two dozen states on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its decision to suspend food stamps during the government shutdown.

The lawsuit, co-led by New York, California and Massachusetts, asks a federal judge to force the US Department of Agriculture to tap into emergency reserve funds to distribute food benefits to the nearly 42 million families and children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). The USDA has said no benefits will be issued on 1 November.

“Snap is one of our nation’s most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running,” the New York attorney general, Letitia James, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on Snap, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.”

The Democratic attorneys general and three governors argue in their lawsuit that the federal government is obliged by law to maintain food benefits to the low-income households who rely on the program. They ask for a ruling by Friday on their motion.

Snap is the nation’s largest nutrition assistance program, according to the USDA, serving roughly one in eight low-income Americans at a cost of approximately $8bn per month. The USDA’s contingency fund is estimated to contain approximately $6bn.

The expiration of Snap benefits has emerged as a major pressure point in the shutdown standoff between Democrats and Republicans. Across the country, food banks and pantries, already struggling under the sharp cuts to federal programs, were bracing for a surge of hungry people if federal food aid is paused, as state officials scrambled to keep assistance flowing to recipients.

Many congressional Democrats and Republicans had called on the Trump administration to use the reserve funding to prevent widespread hunger and financial hardship on millions of American families, but it has so far declined.

“Snap benefits are about to end on Saturday,” the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Fox News. “We don’t have the funding to cover them.”

The USDA’s food and nutrition homepage has a banner with a strikingly partisan message falsely accusing Senate Democrats of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and trans Americans. “Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the notice says. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”

“Despite having the money to fund Snap, the Trump administration is creating needless fear, angst, and harm for millions of families and their children especially as we approach the holidays,” the Massachusetts attorney general, Andrea Joy Campbell, said in a statement. “It is past time for the Trump administration to act to help, rather than harm, those who rely on our government.”

The plaintiffs cite a memo from the agriculture department stating that contingency funds were “not legally available to cover regular benefits” during the government shutdown, which the document blamed on Democrats. The agency said it was only able to tap into the reserve funds under certain circumstances, such as natural disasters.

The memo appears to contradict the department’s lapsed funding plan, released in late September, which stated that Congress’s “evident” intent was for Snap operations to continue during a government shutdown and pointed to “multi-year contingency funds” that could be tapped in the event the closures dragged on. The plan has been removed from the department’s website.

“USDA not only has authority to use contingency funds, it has a legal duty to spend all available dollars to fund Snap benefits,” said California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, adding: “We are taking a stand because families will experience hunger and malnutrition if the Trump administration gets its way.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1410d31b94ce628203719b2082c1e3b582b3cbc/283_0_2968_2374/master/2968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=980574d5e91db41195daec1499f438e2",N,,2025-10-28 19:01:35.217554

‘No Kings’ protests were people-driven, peaceful, and potent

The “No Kings” protests show the growing depth and breadth of opposition to an imperial presidency. Although most Americans lack experience in mounting major resistance efforts against a federal government engaged in authoritarian actions or policies, they peacefully organized in all 50 states to make their demands heard, reaching even further into conservative communities. People of all ages, races, economic statuses, and other backgrounds, including veterans and religious leaders, demanded transformative change in the face of the administration’s unprecedented abuses of power; the weaponization of the military against Democratic-led cities; illegal detentions and arrests by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; President Donald Trump’s self-enrichment and lack of accountability; and the administration’s attacks on key parts of civil society and on the president’s perceived rivals—all while Congress and the courts are largely failing to act as a sufficient check and balance.

Despite the seriousness of the moment, the “No Kings” protests were infused with positivity. Many rallygoers dressed in festive costumes, carried humorous signs, played music, danced, sang, and performed other joyful acts. To show unity, many wore yellow, the color of several nonviolent movements around the world. These tactics can create enthusiasm and are effective tools against strongman leaders.

People voiced their views despite dangerous and threatening language used by some lawmakers and officials who claimed that the “No Kings” protests would be driven by hatred of America and would include terrorist sympathizers and violence. Yet, notably, there was not one reported arrest of any “No Kings” protester nor any widespread violence, perhaps because the organizers conducted nonviolence and deescalation trainings. Protest movements stand a much greater chance of success if they are peaceful.

The 3.5 percent ‘rule’ is an instructive measurement of public sentiment

In a prior article and video, CAP explained how a relatively small number of Americans—12 million—can help stop the nation’s slide into full-scale authoritarianism. Political science research developed by professor Erica Chenoweth of Harvard University and her research partners shows that when a mere 3.5 percent of a nation’s population mobilizes in peaceful protest at a key moment, it signals a powerfully broad movement, making it nearly impossible for the government to ignore the people’s demands. The 3.5 percent rule is not a fixed formula, but rather a solid predictor based on more than 300 successful nonviolent movements around the world. In fact, most movements that succeeded did so without reaching 3.5 percent.

How Peaceful Protest by Just 3.5 Percent of Americans Could Force Major Policy Changes From the Trump Administration

Michael Sozan

As CAP has discussed, movements gain power when they sustain public participation across diverse groups that refuse to allow the government to scare or divide them. Chenoweth’s research also reveals that 3.5 percent participation indicates deeper underlying societal support from nonprotesters and a sense of inevitability, which can help accelerate defections from key pro-government pillars, including leaders from the business, political, cultural, and media sectors. The most effective mobilizations also spur defections from security and military forces who refuse illegal government orders and members of the political party in power, pillars that an imperial-minded leader relies on to entrench his control.

A Green Light for Authoritarianism: How the Trump Administration Fuels Global Autocracy

In the months ahead, broader mobilization could spur change

The “No Kings” protests signal that the United States may be on the brink of a sustained and ideologically broad movement to counter an imperial presidency. Next steps could involve Americans engaging in other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, like they did during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. For example, “general strikes that affect the economy, boycotts, sit-ins, walkouts, or shutdowns of parts of cities can put unavoidable pressure on political leaders to hear their constituents and resolve the matter.”

The grassroots organizations that coordinated the “No Kings” mobilization said they are exploring options such as those described above as well as creating a rapid response network to coordinate quick peaceful pushback, encouraging people to get involved with community groups, and connecting the protests to popular policies such as reducing skyrocketing health care costs or curbing elected officials’ corruption. CAP has suggested a wide range of activities for Americans to make their voices heard, including communicating directly with their federal, state, and local elected officials; creating websites to build a public record of harms to their communities; or pooling money with neighbors to amplify messages via newspaper ads or billboards.

Conclusion

People are refusing to stay silent and instead are engaging in peaceful dissent. Town by town, they are growing a movement to demand a government whose president is not above the law. The United States has crossed the halfway mark toward the 3.5 percent threshold.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.","MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her – and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day by day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. homeland security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives – safe from harm – through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And this Wednesday, Sept. 10, is the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans – including Mariana and Antonio – who would then have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives – or face losing everything.

“We have people … who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. – children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group.

“Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained,” Jozef said. “It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country – people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

(Photo by Grace Berry/News21)

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana – who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country.

“I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

TPS began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months – and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. homeland security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that this year went from $50 to $500, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally – and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise – in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. … The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

Humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” said Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July – titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” – in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says that “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories – the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the United States to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?”

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex – a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples – sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Como estas?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport – possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision; several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right – we’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks – some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive Director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property … let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation – but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied – assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

Said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas: “Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained.”

‘We dream of a normal life’

For the past four years, Mariana and Antonio have rebuilt their lives in the U.S. With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions – such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast – they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids. “That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

“We want to start a family, and we want to find a place where we could be stable and to have a certainty of the future,” Antonio added.

But for now, they can’t see any future beyond Sept. 10, the date their TPS is set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

“This immigration thing has taken over our entire lives,” Mariana said.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

The two recently applied for master’s programs at a university in Miami. Mariana was accepted into her program and starts classes in September. Antonio was accepted but later found out the university was unable to grant him a visa. He is now applying for asylum, despite the risks.

If their plans fail, they will move to Spain.

“I love projections – I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. … I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance: Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K” – the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met – in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together. As Antonio put it: “We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I.”

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Mariana remembers the deep admiration she had for America as a young girl – and the poem, etched on the inside of the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal, that had always represented what she thought the country stood for.

She recited a line – “I lift my lamp beside the golden door” – then paused to think about what it had always meant to her.

“This used to be a place that welcomed people, people willing to work hard,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Of course, I’m going to make it there. The doors are going to be open.’

“That was the case for years, and now it’s not. It has made me very sad about what I thought of this country.”

MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her – and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day by day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. homeland security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives – safe from harm – through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And this Wednesday, Sept. 10, is the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans – including Mariana and Antonio – who would then have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives – or face losing everything.

“We have people … who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. – children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group.

“Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained,” Jozef said. “It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country – people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana – who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country.

“I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

TPS began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months – and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. homeland security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that this year went from $50 to $500, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally – and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise – in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. … The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

Humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” said Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July – titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” – in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says that “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories – the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the United States to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?”

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

Abrego Garcia is in the eighth month of a fierce battle with the Trump administration that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump himself and captured the attention of senior officials across the Trump administration.","TRUTH SERUM TIME — If former special counsel Jack Smith testifies on Capitol Hill, it would be a blockbuster. Will it happen?

Smith has asked Congress to let him testify in public about his failed criminal prosecutions of President Donald Trump — the first stemming from Trump’s complex plot to subvert the 2020 election, the other from Trump’s decision to hoard classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his first term ended.

House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan is mulling the offer, as is Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley; lawmakers are usually loath to let witnesses dictate the terms of their appearances, but Smith is among the biggest fish their panels are chasing, and he wouldn’t be the first special counsel to speak publicly to lawmakers about his work.

High-profile congressional hearings are often an exercise in grandstanding, speechifying and limited substantive value. And Smith may have his own limitations: He could choose to plead the 5th, in an acknowledgment of Trump’s repeated threats to prosecute him; he may be bound by grand jury secrecy from discussing key aspects of the cases; and he must first obtain permission from the Justice Department to speak freely about his work.

But in a hypothetical world in which Smith has no obstacles to testifying — and is delivered a dose of truth serum beforehand — here are the five questions we would ask to generate genuine insight about his ill-fated, historic prosecutions:

1. Did it hurt to have to share oxygen with Alvin Bragg and Fani Willis?

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s hush money prosecution of Trump in New York was widely seen as the weakest of the four criminal cases against him but had the advantage of being the first. Bragg leveled the 34-count indictment in April 2023, two months before your classified documents case.

Fani Willis’ case in Georgia, charging Trump with seeking to corrupt Georgia’s 2020 election results, came less than two weeks after you brought similar charges at the national level. Willis’ indictment was seen as scattershot and resulted in Trump’s infamous mugshot; and of course, it later fell apart over allegations that Willis had a financial conflict stemming from a romantic relationship with a top prosecutor.

Those other cases helped Trump build an argument that he was being unfairly targeted in the heat of his reelection campaign — and group the graver allegations you lodged into an overarching persecution narrative. Would it have been easier if the field had been completely clear?

Moreover, the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling — finding presidents almost entirely immune from prosecution for their official conduct — warned about the potential for dubious cases against former presidents. Do you think Bragg’s trial, which was underway at the precise moment the Supreme Court weighed the immunity question, contributed to the justices’ concerns?

2. Explain the decision to charge only Trump for election subversion and leave the other alleged co-conspirators — like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro — unindicted.

The speculation in legal circles was that keeping the indictment focused squarely on Trump simplified the presentation of evidence, limited the ability of those alleged co-conspirators to gum up the process with disruptive motions or privilege claims and amplified the stakes of the case against him. But it also allowed them to escape potential accountability.

Why did you opt against a more sweeping indictment that included those most closely associated with Trump’s scheme to cling to power?

3. Did the Justice Department’s relatively slow start to the Trump investigation end up being fatal to your case? Would the outcome have been different if prosecutors began pursuing potential crimes by the president in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6?

Now, there is evidence that the review of those close to Trump began much earlier than the public realizes. The Justice Department inspector general began asking about then-DOJ attorney Jeff Clark within weeks of Jan. 6, and fights over efforts to access privileged materials began in early 2022. Trump also used grand jury proceedings to fight prosecutors’ efforts to access his aides’ testimony and his Twitter account, resulting in delays of weeks or even months.

But there was still a lag at the outset of the Biden administration that allowed Trump time to regroup and position himself for the legal fight ahead. Was that a mistake by Attorney General Merrick Garland?

4. Describe your team’s view of the work of the Jan. 6 select committee. Did you view their findings as credible and did you rely on any of their analysis or simply the evidence they amassed?

The House’s Jan. 6 committee interviewed hundreds of witnesses from Trump’s White House, inner circle and political operation, helping lay out in a series of major hearings the first comprehensive history of Trump’s bid to seize a second term despite losing the 2020 election.

But the panel’s most valuable asset was its collection of transcripts and documents from witnesses like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone, former Mike Pence aide Greg Jacob and several other former White House officials who interacted with Trump in the lead up to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

The committee had an uneasy relationship with the Justice Department prior to your appointment as special counsel. The Democratic-led panel rebuffed prosecutors’ requests for their evidence until after the committee completed its work in December 2022, even as prosecutors began building a parallel case.

How much of your case was built upon the foundation the Jan. 6 committee laid?

5. Do you think the American justice system has the capacity to prosecute a former president of the United States?

Not only did your case result in the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which all future presidents could use to shield themselves from legal consequences. But even before that, Trump had managed to stall the case for months over privilege disputes and grand jury battles that ultimately put it out of reach once he was elected.

Regardless of the cases’ merits, does the outcome show that the sheer power even former presidents can bring to bear on the legal system makes such prosecutions impossible? In other words, are presidents, as a practical matter, above the law, even after leaving office?

What'd I Miss?

— Graham Platner’s new campaign manager leaves operation after joining just days ago: Graham Platner’s campaign manager is stepping down after less than a week on the job, the latest departure on a Senate campaign that has seen several high-profile shake-ups in recent weeks as it attempts to fend off a string of controversies. The move, which was first reported by Axios, comes as the Maine Democrat has attracted a wave of criticism for troves of unearthed Reddit posts in which he endorsed political violence, downplayed concerns about sexual assault in the military and self-identified as a communist. That’s in addition to his Nazi-related tattoo.

— ‘Make American Shipbuilding Great Again’: Korea leans into shipbuilding as it woos Trump: President Donald Trump wants more ships made in America. He’s going to need foreign help. Key to this effort, which the administration sees as a national security and economic imperative, is South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean, which acquired the Philly Shipyard in Pennsylvania last year. It’s the linchpin of a broader strategy to counter China’s dominance in the field, which gives the People’s Republic a significant military and economic advantage over the U.S., whose shipbuilding capabilities are anemic in comparison. And shipbuilding could play a critical role in trade negotiations between the Republic of Korea and the United States.

— Trump administration is racing to deport Abrego Garcia ahead of criminal proceedings: The Trump administration is preparing to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia as soon as Friday, reversing an earlier commitment to bring him to trial on human smuggling charges federal prosecutors filed against him in June. Justice Department officials revealed the new plan Monday in a hearing convened by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who has blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation while he attempts to stave it off for good. Abrego Garcia is in the eighth month of a fierce battle with the Trump administration that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump himself and captured the attention of senior officials across the Trump administration.

— Another shutdown consequence: Democrats can’t visit ICE detention facilities: Federal immigration authorities say they no longer have to provide on-demand access to detention facilities for members of Congress. The reason? The government shutdown. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who have been fighting a lawsuit brought by Democratic lawmakers over prior denied visit attempts,have informed lawmakers that they simply don’t have the staff or funding to support those visits. Lawmakers have previously been legally allowed to demand them as part of their oversight duties, which includes monitoring conditions and communicating with detainees facing deportation.

AROUND THE WORLD

FAMILY REUNION — Britain is pushing to form a Western alliance with the European Union to curb China’s dominance in the global steel market, multiple figures familiar with the talks told POLITICO.

The hope in London is that a coordinated approach could help the U.K. dodge the new tariffs Brussels plans to impose — a 50 percent duty aimed at shielding EU producers from China’s industrial overproduction.

Britain, which finds itself at the mercy of EU trade action post-Brexit, is currently seeking carve-outs from those measures.

WISH LIST — Friedrich Merz said the quiet part out loud back in May: Germany intends to build the Bundeswehr into “the strongest conventional army in Europe,” pledging to give it “all the financial resources it needs.”

Five months later, the German chancellor aims to add the hardware to that ambition, according to new internal government documents seen by POLITICO.

The sprawling 39-page list lays out €377 billion in desired buys across land, air, sea, space and cyber. The document is a planning overview of arms purchases that will be spelled out in the German military’s 2026 budget, but many are longer-term purchases for which there is no clear time frame.

PUPPET MASTERS — Nothing about the sand-colored façade of the palazzo tucked behind Milan’s Duomo cathedral suggested that inside it a team of computer engineers were building a database to gather private and damaging information about Italy’s political elite — and use it to try to control them.

The platform, called Beyond, pulled together hundreds of thousands of records from state databases — including flagged financial transactions and criminal investigations — to create detailed profiles on politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures.

Police wiretaps recorded someone they identified as Samuele Calamucci, allegedly the technical mastermind of the group, boasting that the dossiers gave them the power to “screw over all of Italy.”

MAHA MIND-POWER — When Sarah Jones was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, she couldn’t help but dwell on the past: She began dissecting her meals, her exercise regimen and more. Meanwhile, the Make America Healthy Again movement is playing out online and in the government. Every social media scroll yields a new fad diet or supplement, all sustained by the movement’s core tenet of “mind-power” — that you can “become the captain of your own body and the master of your own future.” For Intelligencer, Jones discusses what her post-diagnosis reckoning has taught her about MAHA’s ethos.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs.","WASHINGTON (CN) — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had little to say Tuesday about reports that the Department of Homeland Security purged immigration enforcement chiefs in several U.S. cities as the Trump administration looks to supercharge its mass deportation campaign.

Both Republicans and Democrats were hesitant to weigh in on the staffing shake-up, which would see officials from U.S. Border Patrol replace the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

But at least one lawmaker speculated that the Homeland Security Department made the staffing changes to support what he called the White House’s “unrealistic” deportation quotas.

According to a report from the Washington Examiner, the agency last week removed five ICE field office chiefs and moved them to positions elsewhere in the country. In addition to reassigning the heads of immigration enforcement in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Homeland Security Department also removed ICE chiefs in Phoenix and San Diego.

The administration reportedly plans to replace most of the ousted immigration heads with senior staff from Border Patrol, though in Philadelphia, the vacant ICE role will be filled by an official from Homeland Security Investigations.

While the move to replace top ICE officials with Border Patrol — which has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under its chief, Gregory Bovino — is unprecedented, lawmakers largely claimed Tuesday that they didn’t have enough information to take a firm stance on the issue.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a senior Republican member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, declined to comment to Courthouse News. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, another GOP lawmaker on the homeland security panel, said that he had seen reporting about the purges but that he didn’t “know enough” about the situation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed ignorance of the ICE leadership purge during a news conference Tuesday morning, telling Courthouse News that he had only just learned about the reports. He added that “some of these things get mis-portrayed.”

Democrats were similarly reticent to offer their thoughts. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told Courthouse News that he had not yet been briefed and declined to offer any additional input.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat who also sits on the Homeland Security committee, posited that the staffing shake-up at ICE’s field offices was thanks to the immigration agency’s failure to meet the Trump administration’s “completely unrealistic” deportation quotas.

White House adviser Stephen Miller has long demanded that ICE arrest as many as 3,000 immigrants a day, or 1 million per year.

“This kind of executive action simply shows the moral bankruptcy of their policies,” said Blumenthal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, did not directly respond to reports of the purge at ICE, saying instead that Americans were “understandably horrified” at the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“It’s our hope that, if there’s going to be a change in personnel, it’s actually to enact a more humane approach, rather than what we’ve seen in community after community in the country,” said Jeffries.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs. The agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, told Courthouse News in a statement Tuesday that it had “no personnel changes to announce right now.”

“This is one team, one fight,” McLaughlin wrote. “President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

A spokesperson for the Border Patrol union did not return a request for comment.

News that Border Patrol officials may be taking over for ICE in several major cities comes as Bovino on Tuesday was dressed down by a federal judge over his failure to comply with a court order blocking federal agents from deploying tear gas and other riot control weapons against protesters, journalists and other bystanders in Chicago.

The judge demanded that Bovino, who has personally participated in the federal crackdown on the Windy City and has himself deployed tear gas on demonstrators, appear before her daily to report new incidents. Bovino admitted to the court that he did not use a body-worn camera and agreed to begin wearing one.

The Trump administration has in recent weeks sent federal agents and National Guard troops into several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The White House has framed the move as an effort to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. Some federal courts have ruled that the president’s deployment of National Guard troops violates federal law.

According to recent statistics, more than 70% of people held by ICE have no prior criminal convictions.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-28 16:56:59.811201

That order came Tuesday after Bovino testified before federal Judge Sara Ellis on questions surrounding the use of chemical agents by immigration enforcement officers in the city and suburbs.

Bovino, a chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was recorded on video throwing a cannister of tear gas Thursday during a clash between agents and protesters in the Little Village neighborhood.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Bovino was struck in the head by an object prior to the recorded incident, but it still raised questions about the tactics of officers after Ellis had issued a temporary restraining order aimed at curtailing the use of chemical agents during enforcement operations.

Ellis had also issued an order that all immigration agents in Chicago wear body cameras during operations.

During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in federal court in Chicago every day at 6 p.m. to report how operations proceeded in the city and suburbs during the preceding 24 hours.

Local

She also ordered Bovino to turn over agents’ use of force reports from September 2 forward, and to turn in body camera footage by Friday as part of that reporting.

Border Patrol officials have previously testified before Ellis that the use of chemical agents in multiple incidents was justified, alleging protesters were throwing objects at agents.

Last week, Ellis extended questioning of Bovino from two hours to five because she wanted to hear about agents’ recent use of force in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village. During a separate enforcement operation last week in Little Village and the adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained before protesters gathered at the scene, local officials said.

Silva-Renteria said anxiety among holders of citizenship papers or a cherished green card, as well as those in the United States without lawful status, was growing.

“It’s very, very difficult to just see how separation is happening, the cruelty that is happening,” she said. “There’s just this fear that is happening across the board. The fear that we’re facing … it’s not only for the undocumented population.”

During a gathering of Kansas Democrats on Saturday in Wichita, Silva-Renteria said advocacy on behalf of immigrant communities might in the future be labeled subversive by the federal government and lead to legal challenges to her naturalization. She is executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Wichita.

“I think what I’m doing right now, it can be seen as me fighting against the government,” Silva-Renteria said. “It is a fear, even for someone like me who has been a naturalized citizen for more than 20 years. Before, it was never a question. I could share my story all over the place and I could feel safe. But now, I don’t.”

Silva-Renteria walked across the border from Mexico with her mother at age 10, received permanent resident status in the United States as a teenager and earned a master’s degree in social work at Wichita State University. She is a cofounder, with Wichita immigration attorney Sarah Balderas, of the Kansas Immigration Coalition. Its mission is to safeguard the dignity and well-being of immigrants statewide.

Risk of assumptions

Balderas, who teaches immigration law at Washburn University, said the political climate in regard to immigration could prompt people to insert themselves into enforcement activities by mistakenly alleging people were in the United States without legal authority.

“You see someone who is from another country speaking a different language, you can’t automatically assume they don’t have status,” she said.

She said general public knowledge of immigration law was so deficient that most people didn’t appreciate a person could hold a temporary visa, be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program or hold permanent residency status without being proficient in English.

Reading and writing ability enters the picture in a federal regulatory sense when applying for citizenship, she said.

“There are so many misconceptions about immigration, and it’s simply because of a lack of education. Nobody talks about this stuff. We just hear what we hear in the news or we hear what we hear from friends, and it’s really complicated,” Balderas said.

She said the reality was there were millions of people in the United States who would never qualify for lawful permanent resident status, a prerequisite for applying for U.S. citizenship.

“You have a typical situation where you have mom and dad entering the country illegally together,” she said. “They came over 21 years ago because — guess what — their U.S. citizen-born kid is turning 21 and they’re like, ‘Hell, yes, our 21-year-old kid is going to apply for us.’ The problem is that they both, mom and dad, entered illegally. If each of them do not have a spouse or a parent with lawful permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship, they will never be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident.”

Politics of reform

Balderas said U.S. immigration law was designed to keep people out of the country. She said Congress, which is responsible for formation of immigration law, failed to make modest changes that could unclog the immigration system to better accommodate people in the United States without legal status who worked hard, paid taxes and avoided criminal entanglement.

She said the answer in the United States wasn’t debate about a politically fraught amnesty program.

“Everyone’s angry at President Trump. I get it. He is enforcing the immigration laws to the fullest extent possible,” Balderas said. “But we are going to be in this situation every four years if Congress doesn’t make changes in the immigration law. Politics is what’s holding these people hostage.”

U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita area, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for securing the southern border with Mexico. He said U.S. Border Patrol data indicated illegal crossing was at the lowest level since 1970s.

“President Trump promised to secure our southern border, and he has delivered on his promise,” Estes said. “In fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol captured 238,000 illegal immigrants. When Joe Biden was president, 2.2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended at the southern border.”

In September, the Trump administration reported elevated enforcement actions had led to deportation of 400,000 people and the voluntary departure of an estimated 1.6 million people from the United States.

Silva-Renteria said she worked primarily with people from Mexico, India, Vietnam, China, Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Latin American nations.

In Kansas, an estimated 116,000 people had at least one immigrant parent and 74,000 of these individuals earned the right to vote in elections.

“Something very important, especially for those that are elected officials, pay attention to the number of immigrants that now have voting rights,” Silva-Renteria said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sarah-Balderas-2-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:57:24.557943

Immigrant rights activists are condemning what they call a brutal arrest made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials Monday afternoon.

It happened around 1 p.m. on the first floor of the Stamford Superior Court parking garage.

Video appears to show four ICE agents - three of which are wearing FBI vests - apprehending a man on the ground as he cries out for help.

The man is then lifted up off the ground and put into the backseat of a black car.

""They manhandled him trying to get him out of the car,"" witness Lizzie Eifler says. ""This poor man's face was smashed into the pavement and they would not get off of him.""

The organization Stamford Norwalk United for Immigrants says it's witnessing arrests like this on a regular basis.

""There's not much we can do except document it, but what we're seeing is horrifying,"" Eifler says. ""As far as we know, they don't have warrants, nobody shows a badge, nothing.""

Stamford police responded to the scene to control the crowd that had built up.

ICE had not responded to our request for comment as of Monday evening.

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487 into law, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), 775 ILCS 5/7A-102. Among other reforms going into effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation fundamentally changes how the Illinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR” or the “Department”) processes charges of discrimination.

Most notably, the law eliminates mandatory fact-finding conferences. For decades, these conferences were a hallmark of the Department’s investigative approach, giving complainants, respondents, and the agency a chance to gather information early, test the strength of claims, and sometimes even prompt informal resolution. Their removal will change how employers, employees, and practitioners must navigate discrimination charges in Illinois.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally

A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination. The investigator can question witnesses, review documentary evidence, and attempt to clarify disputed facts. While not a mediation, these conferences often create opportunities for early settlement discussions. For employers, they also offer a critical chance to gain insight into the complainant’s allegations and to present documents and testimony before the Department issues a determination.

From Mandatory to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

Prior to Senate Bill 2487, fact-finding conferences were mandatory for nearly every charge of discrimination. An employer could only avoid this requirement if the charge was dismissed early, the Director issued a determination of substantial evidence, or the parties voluntarily agreed to waive the conference in writing. Nonattendance without good cause could result in dismissal of the charge or default judgment.

With the passage of the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be optional and occur only in limited circumstances.

If both the complainant and the respondent wish to have a fact-finding conference, they must make that request in writing within ninety (90) days of the charge being filed. Importantly, agreeing to a conference also means agreeing to extend the Department’s investigative deadline by an additional 120 days, giving the Department more time to complete its review. Even if the parties do not request one, the Department still has discretion to convene a conference on its own if it believes doing so would help clarify the case or resolve factual disputes.

The procedural rules surrounding attendance remain in place. If a conference is scheduled, the parties must appear. A complainant who fails to attend without good cause risks dismissal of the charge, while an employer who fails to appear can be held in default.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences. The Department has long struggled with processing times, and fact-finding conferences have historically been resource-intensive.

The amendment also brings Illinois more in line with federal practice, where charges of discrimination are typically investigated through written position statements, document requests, and interviews.

[Read: Are Large ICE Raids Coming Back to Orange County?]

Since the summer, dozens of residents and activists have shown up to several city council meetings demanding elected officials take a stance against the immigration crackdown and launch an immigrant aid fund to support Garden Grove families impacted by the raids.

For months a majority of city council members have avoided adopting any resolution in response to the federal immigration crackdown or starting a fund to help immigrants with rent, food or utility bills like in Anaheim, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and potentially in Fullerton.

That might change at Tuesday’s 6:30 p.m. Garden Grove City Council meeting where officials are expected to consider adopting a resolution that calls on law enforcement agencies to respect civil liberties and would create an online resource hub on the city website.

To read the resolution, click here.

Councilwoman Ariana Arestegui, who requested the resolution, said it has been an “uphill battle” to get a majority of her colleagues on the dais to respond to the immigration sweeps impacting local families.

“Garden Grove is not unique in what it’s facing, but what has been unique is that we’ve been so slow to respond to an issue that so many of our regional partners are doing their best to address,” she said in a Monday phone interview.

“We’ve had so many residents come to us since the beginning of the federal law enforcement presence in our area, and the message is resoundingly clear – our residents want us to keep them informed.”

In August, Arestegui brought forth a resolution reaffirming that local police officers do not participate in immigration enforcement and recognizing the fear felt by residents amid an increased federal law enforcement presence but a majority of her colleagues voted to table it.

Arestegui said the resource hub would help provide important information to immigrant families as well as businesses owners impacted by the raids.

She also said whether Garden Grove launches a legal aid fund or rent assistance program for immigrants will be up to her colleagues on the council.

“Our community has expressed that that is an interest. My question to the other folks on my council is that an action that you are also willing to take? I cannot do this on my own, and I would need further conversations with my colleagues and my city staff to even see if that is a capability for us as a city,” Arestegui said.

Other elected officials in Orange County have called on local police to cooperate and work with federal immigration agents – a move that would violate California’s Sanctuary State law.

Garden Grove City Councilman Joe DoVinh recently received backlash for comments he made in Vietnamese on a radio show calling on police to cooperate with immigration enforcement officers and threatening to fire the police chief himself.

Arestegui said no council member has the power to individually fire the police chief.

In a news release after the nationwide No King protests earlier this month, DoVinh said there has been a politicization of Trump’s policies on immigration in Garden Grove and the millions that joined the protests do not speak for all Americans.

“While we strongly support law enforcement, we also call for the Equal Protection of all immigrants, documented or not– this is basic human rights that need to be respected in a civil society like US,” reads the Oct. 19 news release

DoVinh said in an email Monday he would speak to the issue at Tuesday’s meeting.

The proposed resolution reiterates that Garden Grove police officers do not conduct immigration enforcement.

In Garden Grove, about 49% of residents or roughly 84,000 people are foreign born. Of that, about 31,000 of residents are not U.S. citizens and 53,000 are naturalized citizens, according to the census.

Over 42% of the population in Garden Grove is Asian and 37% is Latino.

According to the USC Equity Research Institute, over 210,000 people in Orange County are undocumented.

Under the proposed resolution, city staff would be directed to identify immigration aid services and programs like legal aid and know your rights information and maintain a list of them on the city’s website.

Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Santa Ana and Stanton have all launched similar informational hubs on their websites.

Staff would also be directed to create emergency preparedness packets for families impacted by the raids and city officials would commit to working with nonprofits and community organizations to identify ways to better support residents amid the immigration crackdown.

Arestegui said as immigration enforcement sweeps spread in the city, the pressure from residents on elected officials in Garden Grove to respond amplifies.

She adds she is optimistic that the majority of city council members will support her resolution this time.

“The evidence that our community needs help is becoming incontrovertible,” Arestegui said.

“To turn the other way would be irresponsible for us.”

We’re also seeing people leaving within the human resources section of the Justice Department.
Terry Gerton Right, and you mentioned that usually these folks stay, regardless of the party that’s in control of the presidency.
Terry Gerton Were the majority of these DOJ departures as a result of the DRP?
Terry Gerton And DOJ also has a pretty large responsibility for enforcing tax laws, right?","Suzanne Monyak We found that more than a third of career managers at the Justice Department have left this year since the start of the second Trump administration. This is pretty unusual, because leaders who are hired through the career process tend to stay through political administrations. They’re not political appointees. They stay, sometimes for decades even, with the government.

Terry Gerton So what kind of roles are we talking about here? Lawyers, managers, all of the above?

Suzanne Monyak A mix of both. We used a federal directory posted by the Office of Personnel Management under government transparency law that included more than 300 career leaders at the Justice Department. They include some members of the Senior Executive Service and other management positions. Some of them are lawyers, some of them are not.

Terry Gerton Are there particular sectors in the Department of Justice that were more impacted by these departures than others?

Suzanne Monyak Yes, even though it was about a third overall at least, we saw more than three quarters of, for example, the civil rights division, those managers had left during the second administration. This, I think, is a reflection of how hard of a pivot that division has taken under this administration to align with the second Trump administration’s ideological priorities.

Terry Gerton And what about immigration and environmental divisions? They seem to be pretty significantly impacted as well.

Suzanne Monyak Yes, we really saw a lot of the attrition in divisions that affected policy areas that the administration has really targeted. So the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is the component that houses the immigration courts, and the environmental division, which enforces environmental laws across the country, lost about half of its career leaders, at least.

Terry Gerton We certainly hear a lot of talk in the press and in the political cycles about the Department of Justice. But what exactly do these folks do on a day-to-day basis? Are they defending the government? Are they prosecuting? What is their day-to-day role?

Suzanne Monyak It really varies. We looked at more than 300 roles across the department. So, yes, there are attorneys who are in management roles, maybe overseeing litigators. We’re also seeing people leaving within the human resources section of the Justice Department. So it really just runs the gamut in the types of roles that they are. But what they have in common is that they were all appointed through the career process. And that’s a merits based process. And a lot of those people have many years, if not decades, of experience each.

Terry Gerton Right, and you mentioned that usually these folks stay, regardless of the party that’s in control of the presidency. So what makes this cycle of departure so unusual?

Suzanne Monyak Well, that’s exactly it. Most people, a lot of people, when they joined the federal government, that’s a career for life for them. And some of the people that I spoke to for this story, they never saw themselves leaving at this time or retiring early. They saw this as where they were going to spend the rest of their careers. And then when this administration took over, deferred resignation offers came out and some of the divisions just had to take a very different stance than they had taken in the past, and they were being asked to do work they hadn’t been asked to do in the past that really just represented a departure from the work that had been done previously. And there’s just been an environment under this administration to really push out federal workers. And I think that’s something that administration officials have been pretty open about, that they want to get deep state actors out of government, as they describe them, and they want to do a fresh start or a redirect. And so we really did see that across the Justice Department and across the government more broadly, as people took those offers, were pushed out and left.

Terry Gerton Were the majority of these DOJ departures as a result of the DRP?

Suzanne Monyak It’s hard to say exactly why everyone left. Some people will disclose why they left in post. Some people do not. Quite a few were from the deferred resignation offer, absolutely. Two of those went out this year, which allowed federal government employees to remain on paid leave through the end of the fiscal year, which ended at the end of September. But we also saw people who were fired. We saw people who left voluntarily, technically, but after being forcibly reassigned or demoted. Some people, career managers with many years of experience, were put in a task force called the Sanctuary Cities Working Group, which ended up being known as a task force that didn’t do meaningful work, at least in the view of a lot of the people there, and now has no one working there. None of the people reassigned there are still with the department.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Suzanne Monyak. She’s a reporter at Bloomberg Law. So, Suzanne, with this significant departure, a third of the Department of Justice leaders, but concentrated in some particular divisions, what happens to DOJ’s functionality and effectiveness? Like, this seems to represent a significant loss of institutional memory. How will that impact how DOJ does its work?

Suzanne Monyak That’s a great question. And I think that’s one that a lot of former officials, a concern that they raised in the interviews for this story. It’s absolutely a significant loss of expertise and institutional memory. One role that career people will really have throughout the government is that when political administrations change, you’ll see new political appointees come in. And maybe they have experience doing this work at the career level, maybe they don’t. And having a career staff already in place, knowing how things work, knowing what to do, I’m told can really sort of ease that transition as the politicals come in and out as administrations change. Certainly, I think with this amount of loss, they’re going to be doing hiring. But until those new people are in place, we are, I cannot help but imagine that there will be some compromise of functionality to the Justice Department.

Terry Gerton Well, you mentioned the expectation that they would be hiring, and yet the federal government remains under a hiring freeze across the board. Has DOJ received any exceptions for that to begin hiring to replace these folks?

Suzanne Monyak There have been exceptions made. We’ve seen hiring, for example, at the civil rights division, the one that lost more than 76% of its career managers. It also lost a number of its lower level attorneys as well. And we have already seen hiring in that division. The political leader heading it has been posting on social media, we’re hiring, we’re hiring. So we are seeing some enthusiasm from administration officials to kind of bring those people on. So yes, there have been exceptions made.

Terry Gerton We’ve been talking here about the divisions that were most significantly impacted by departures, but were there others that weren’t, so that their workload kind of continued on?

Suzanne Monyak Yes, we saw lower levels of departures in the criminal division, for example. I think that one was slightly less affected. At the civil division, whose attorneys handle a lot of the litigation against the Trump administration’s federal policies, they lost at least about a quarter of their career managers. So while we did see pretty high shares across the board, there were certainly some that were below that one third we saw overall.

Terry Gerton And DOJ also has a pretty large responsibility for enforcing tax laws, right? They have a tax division. How were they affected?

Suzanne Monyak Yes. The tax division lost at least a third of its career managers, so right around that across the board point. The national security division lost about half. And I should also mention that these are really all minimum numbers. These were departures that we were able to confirm and be sure of, but it’s likely an undercount because there are people who would still be on the website, even though they’ve left and people are leaving every day. So in between when I report the story and it publishes, we might even have had a few more departures.

Terry Gerton And so as you talk to folks either in or recently in the Department of Justice, what’s their takeaway? What does this mean for the effectiveness of the department and its future?

Suzanne Monyak I mean, I think there’s definitely a lot of concerns, both about its ability to do its work and about morale across the department. One of the appeals of working in the government is having a stable job that you can spend years and years doing. And that ideal, I think, has really been eroded under this administration. And that’s not specific to the Justice Department. We’re seeing that everywhere. And I also think there’s been a lot of concerns about politicization at the Justice Department, as we’re seeing a lot of career people leaving, people who’ve worked through multiple political administrations from both parties who, their goal is just to do their job and enforce or argue the laws as they see them, or as they’re supposed to. We see with more political people coming in, career people coming out, I think that just kind of fuels those concerns that this department might be more politicized under this administration than it has in the past.

Terry Gerton And the technicalities of the cases that the Department of Justice handles are pretty significant. So it’s not like you can just walk in from a private sector commercial firm and understand the roles of the Department of Justice, right?

Suzanne Monyak Absolutely. A lot of people at DOJ have talked about how, what they do, it is a niche expertise. It is something that you have to learn how to do that, just as you said, working at a big firm would not necessarily, you wouldn’t come in knowing exactly what to do, hitting the ground running always. And so there is something to be said for having had that experience in the government, for having argued in court for the government for years and know what you’re doing before you, say, become a manager. So, you see that really from the top down. When people lose their managers, it it affects morale at the lower levels as well.

Terry Gerton And do you think in the long run, is this likely to affect the success of the DOJ in the cases that it does bring before the courts?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump_Justice_Department_47916-scaled-e1743102026706.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:01:56.718099

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said many prejudicial comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other senior officials violated a local court rule and threaten Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

The judge’s warning is the latest example of Trump officials’ incendiary extrajudicial comments being used against the Department of Justice (DOJ) in high-profile criminal and civil cases.

“Government employees have made extrajudicial statements that are troubling, especially where many of them are exaggerated if not simply inaccurate,” Crenshaw wrote in an opinion Monday.

“These statements made allegations regarding Abrego’s ‘character or reputation’ and expressed government officials’ views on Abrego’s ‘guilt or innocence,’” the judge added.

Among several examples, Crenshaw highlighted Noem describing Abrego Garcia in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press release as being an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” an assertion that other DHS officials repeated in other public releases.

Crenshaw also noted that Bondi made extrajudicial statements while officially announcing charges against Abrego Garcia in June.

Stopping short of issuing a gag order, Crenshaw instead instructed prosecutors to inform DOJ and DHS employees — including Bondi and Noem — of a local court rule limiting official comments on ongoing criminal cases.

The judge said despite the statements, he was confident Abrego Garcia would ultimately receive a fair trial because media coverage of the case has “gradually subsided” both nationally and in Tennessee.

Earlier this month, Crenshaw found that Abrego Garcia showed there was a “realistic likelihood” that the DOJ is vindictively prosecuting him for asserting his legal rights in his successful civil lawsuit challenging his removal to El Salvador.

The most telling statement, Crenshaw said, came from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said on Fox News in June that the government only started investigating Abrego Garcia after a judge ruled that the Trump administration did not have the authority to remove him from the U.S.

Crenshaw said Abrego Garcia was entitled to discovery against the Trump administration and a hearing in which he can present evidence on why his case should be tossed for vindictive and selective prosecution.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers moved to subpoena Blanche and other senior DOJ officials to testify at the vindictive prosecution hearing, which is set to take place next week. However, the DOJ has asked Crenshaw to quash those subpoenas.

Separately, DOJ attorneys told a U.S. district judge in Maryland that the Trump administration would seek to deport Abrego Garcia to Liberia by the end of the week — even if doing so would collapse the department’s criminal case against him in Tennessee.

Liberia is just the latest in a series of African countries the Trump administration has designated as possible destinations for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who has lived in the U.S. for years with his wife and children — all of whom are American citizens.

The litigation started shortly after a New York Times article in early 2020 highlighted the company's alleged practices involving facial recognition technology and its growing list of government and private clients. According to the lawsuit, Clearview built an extensive database of face images by scraping photos from publicly available websites and recording individuals' facial features.

The plaintiffs proceeded with claims based on statutes and the common law from Illinois, California, New York, and Virginia, with the strongest claims under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. As the case progressed, it became evident that, although Clearview was a highly valued company, it lacked the liquid assets to pay a large lump-sum settlement or even sustain its ongoing defense. Given these circumstances, the parties devised a novel settlement structure that granted class members a 23 percent stake in Clearview. This settlement stake was valued at approximately $51.75 million, based on Clearview’s January 2024 valuation of $225 million. Four triggering events could activate the payment of the settlement equity stake to the class members:

The occurrence of an initial public offering.

The occurrence of a liquidation event, such as a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Clearview's assets.

A payment by Clearview of an amount equal to 17 percent of Clearview's recognized revenue for the period beginning on the date of final settlement approval and ending with the election of this option, which will expire on September 30, 2027. The recognized revenue will be determined according to recognized Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The amount that the Settlement Class will receive if it elects to sell its right to receive the Settlement Stake payment.

The settlement class has the right to choose which payout event they deem most advantageous through their chosen Settlement Master. Through the settlement agreement, the Settlement Master was granted certain powers to protect the class members' interests, including the following:

The right to inspect Clearview's books and records upon providing reasonable notice.

The right to request and receive biannual interviews with Clearview's management team.

The right to receive information regarding the price and terms of any secondary sales of Clearview

The right to sell the equity stake in Clearview if deemed in the best interest of the class.

Although the Court approved the settlement, questions remain. Because of the liquidated damages provisions of the Biometric Information Privacy Act, there are concerns about whether a settlement with an indefinite fund value accurately measures damages for BIPA violations. On the surface, it may appear that equity in a company is not “liquidated damages” within the meaning of the BIPA. However, the court did not address this question. Rather, the court focused on the lack of injunctive relief provided by the settlement and the fairness of the settlement.

Recent BIPA amendments, which limited the liquidated damages available to plaintiffs, seem to have reduced the threat of significant awards that might have prompted a “Clearview-like” settlement. In any event, for parties facing potentially overwhelming damages from BIPA litigation, the Clearview settlement offers a way for plaintiffs to secure compensation while preventing defendants from being overwhelmed by significant class actions.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9985_1458.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:57:35.609767

(Source: X/DHS)

A fresh row erupted on social media after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted an image comparing undocumented immigrants to the parasitic alien race known as “the Flood” from the popular video game series Halo. The move came just days after the White House shared its own AI-generated Halo meme featuring President Donald Trump as Master Chief, Halo's main protagonist. This angered gamers and human rights advocates alike. The post appeared early Monday morning on DHS’s official X account. The image showed Xbox’s iconic character, Master Chief, standing atop a Warthog vehicle with the Halo ring world in the background. The caption read, “Finishing this fight,” referencing the famous line from Halo 2 and the marketing slogan for Halo 3. Below it, text reading “Destroy the Flood” appeared beside a link to a recruitment page for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The message was immediately slammed as “dehumanising” for likening immigrants to the Flood, a fictional parasitic species that infects and consumes all intelligent life in the game’s universe. Critics noted that this comparison echoed some of history’s darkest propaganda. As one commentator put it, “Comparing immigrants in the US to a parasitic alien life form… is rooted in the worst of human history.” The Halo row began on Saturday when GameStop shared a humorous post announcing the “end of console wars” after Microsoft revealed that Halo: Combat Evolved would be released on PlayStation 5 next year. The White House then replied to GameStop’s post with an AI-generated image of Trump dressed as Master Chief, captioned “Power to the Players.” GameStop later escalated the exchange by retweeting the White House’s image alongside another meme showing a bloated JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, depicted as Cortana, Master Chief’s AI companion in the game. However, the situation soured after DHS jumped into the meme war with its “Destroy the Flood” post. Social media users accused the administration of using video game imagery to promote anti-immigrant propaganda and normalise cruelty through humour. “It’s ‘the police using The Punisher logo’ levels of media illiteracy,” one user wrote on Reddit. Microsoft, which owns the Halo franchise, has not issued any official comment. One observer summed it up, “It’s a bold strategy for an agency hoping to look heroic, but it seems ICE missed the part where the good guys fight to protect all of humanity.”

Washington, D.C. – Today, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee Ranking Member Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) demanded answers from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on why their agencies have prioritized checking off the wish lists of oil, timber, and mining companies during the ongoing Republican government shutdown while halting critical public safety, wildfire prevention, and disaster preparedness work.

The members wrote that while millions of working people face a loss of services because of “Congressional Republicans’ inability to garner the votes to open the government even when they control both houses of Congress,” the Trump administration has kept operations for oil, timber, and mining running at full speed.

The letter follows reports that, under the Trump administration’s orders, Interior and Agriculture have kept permitting offices open for drilling, mining, and logging while furloughing staff who support wildfire response, park operations, and disaster preparedness.

The lawmakers detail how the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have continued issuing new oil and gas drilling permits—more than 300 since the shutdown began—while advancing controversial mining projects such as the Ambler Road in Alaska and the Libby Mine in Montana. At the same time, the agencies have held coal lease sales, closed visitor centers, paused prescribed burns, and furloughed critical wildfire support staff.

They have cited a so-called “national energy emergency” to justify keeping fossil fuel operations running, even as they halted major renewable energy projects like Nevada’s 6.2-gigawatt solar development.

The members warn that “continuing to prioritize activities benefitting extractive industries over activities supporting the protection of life and property represents an abandonment of basic agency responsibilities and potentially violates the Antideficiency Act.” That law, they explain, “prohibits federal agencies from incurring obligations or accepting voluntary services during a lapse in appropriations except in narrowly defined emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

The members also raised concerns about risks to public safety, noting that the shutdown has “impeded your agencies’ ability to fight wildfire, respond to other natural disasters, and protect our national parks.”

They warned that by directing personnel to continue routine fossil fuel activities, “your agencies have expanded the emergency exception beyond its intent to cover ‘ongoing, regular functions’ of government administration,” which “GAO precedent emphasizes agencies cannot lawfully direct staff to perform in the absence of appropriations or authorization.”

The lawmakers requested documents describing which activities and services have continued during the shutdown, the criteria used to make those determinations, and all communications regarding the designation of oil, mining, and timber production from public lands as “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

Why it matters: The Trump administration has put significant pressure on ICE to meet the administration's arrest and deportation goals.

Driving the news: Almost half of ICE's field office directors are being shifted out of their roles in an effort to ramp up immigration enforcement.

They will be replaced with leaders from other parts of the Department of Homeland Security, including Border Patrol, which has been assisting ICE in its operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Zoom in: The Washington Examiner first reported the leadership shakeup on Monday, which included removing ICE's top staff in Portland, Denver, San Diego, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

The field office directors are being reassigned, one source told Axios.

More changes in other offices around the country are expected today, one source told Axios.

There are 25 field offices across the country and as many as a dozen changes are possible.

Zoom out: Fox News reported that the leadership changes come as there's a split between Trump administration officials.

Sources told Fox that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wants broader arrest priorities, while White House border czar Tom Homan and ICE acting Director Todd Lyons prefer to prioritize arrests of undocumented people with criminal records.

But Noem's media interviews and public statements have often focused on targeting the ""worst of the worst"" and people with criminal records.

Homan has said in several interviews that ""if you're in the country illegally, you're on the table"" for arrest and deportation. One source said Lyons is also equally committed to broad enforcement.

What they're saying: ICE's deputy director Madison Sheahan told Fox News on Tuesday that there's ""not a split in leadership.""

""Sec. Noem, President Trump, Director Todd Lyons are all in lock step to be able to deliver for the American people,"" Sheahan said. ""Our job is to go out and target criminal illegal aliens... We are one team and this is one fight to deliver for the American people.

The intrigue: Replacing ICE leadership with Border Patrol is expected to increase the number of arrests in part because ICE's arrests are typically targeted.

Border Patrol has been behind more indiscriminate operations, including raids at Home Depots or other work sites.

Targeted arrests require more surveillance and planning.

Flashback: In May, roughly a week after White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller set a 3,000 arrest goal target, ICE swapped out two of its top leaders in Washington — ousting the heads of Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations.

In February, reportedly due to lagging daily arrest totals, ICE's acting director and deputy director were also both replaced.",https://images.axios.com/cQk4LRM59fcmzeIredtNtW-b_2k=/0x238:4000x2488/1366x768/2025/10/28/1761671178142.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 13:58:01.999920

In just two days, more than 26,000 people have been forced to flee the city following intense fighting, according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).

IOM is dispatching emergency shelter items, including kits and tents, which are scheduled to arrive within a few days to Tawila village, a major centre in Darfur receiving displaced persons from El Fasher.

Reports of violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights in El Fasher are deeply concerning, including indiscriminate attacks, targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, gender-based violence, and ethnically motivated attacks against displaced populations.

Scenes emerging from El Fasher are horrific. Thousands of families are once again displaced due to violence and forced to walk for days under the scorching sun. Mothers are carrying infants, and children are helping elderly relatives who can barely stand.

They are facing high insecurity, movement restrictions, protection risks, theft and assaults with most having nothing left: no food, no shelter, no medicine, and no certainty of where they will be safe next. People arrive in small villages around El Fasher exhausted, hungry, and terrified.

This surge in displacement is amplifying the already dire needs. Shelter, food, health care, clean water, and protection are urgently needed. IOM’s DTM programme continues to provide critical information and relevant data on needs and displacement trends to help humanitarian actors deliver evidence-based responses. Yet access remains extremely limited, and needs are rising faster than aid can reach people.

Deportation could moot the criminal proceedings.
Whether and when the administration can remove him again is the subject of separate pending litigation in Maryland.
The rebuke came Monday in one of two rulings issued by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee.
(Schrader’s resignation was reportedly prompted by the case being pursued for political reasons.)","Litigation over Kilmar Abrego Garcia continues to dog the Trump administration, which illegally sent him to El Salvador in March, then said it would never bring him back him to the U.S., then returned him to the U.S. and now has to prove that the criminal case it had waiting for him upon his return isn’t unconstitutionally vindictive. All the while, the administration is working to remove him from the country again, possibly to the West African nation of Liberia, to which he has no apparent ties.

Deportation could moot the criminal proceedings. Whether and when the administration can remove him again is the subject of separate pending litigation in Maryland.

But so long as Abrego remains in the U.S., the Trump Justice Department is stuck having to prove the Tennessee criminal case, which the government seemed to develop in an effort to save face when it finally complied with court orders for his return in June. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Abrego “has landed in the United States to face justice.” She said, “This is what American justice looks like.”

Now, remarks from Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have drawn a rebuke from the judge presiding over the criminal case, in which federal prosecutors allege that Abrego illegally transported undocumented immigrants. He has pleaded not guilty. The rebuke came Monday in one of two rulings issued by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee. In granting Abrego’s motion to require DOJ and DHS officials to refrain from making “prejudicial extrajudicial statements,” Crenshaw wrote that “government employees have made extrajudicial statements that are troubling, especially where many of them are exaggerated if not simply inaccurate.”

The Barack Obama appointee highlighted statements from Bondi and Noem that he said appeared to violate a court rule prohibiting extrajudicial statements (that is, those made outside of court) that have a “substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing” the defendant’s right to a fair trial. He cited Noem’s statement that Abrego is an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” and Bondi’s statement that Abrego played “a significant role in an alien smuggling ring” that “was his full-time job,” and that he “was a smuggler of humans and children and women.”

Crenshaw issued an order accompanying his ruling that puts DOJ and DHS employees “on notice” of the court rule against making such statements. He warned that any violations “may be subject to sanctions.” So unless Bondi, Noem or any other officials make it a point to test the judge’s order, nothing more may come of it.

‘Not an ordinary case’

The judge’s other order Monday gets closer to the substance of the case and how it will proceed, specifically concerning Abrego’s bid to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they’re unconstitutionally vindictive. Ahead of a hearing on the subject set for next week, Crenshaw noted that the defendant has “established a reasonable likelihood that his prosecution was motivated, at least in part, in retaliation for him exercising his constitutional rights in his Maryland immigration case.”

The judge conceded that in an “ordinary case,” the government would be right to shield documents that reveal internal motivations behind prosecutions. But he wrote that this “is not an ordinary case.”

The judge issued an order accompanying that ruling to say that he’ll review certain materials himself before deciding what exactly Abrego can use in his attempt to prove vindictiveness. Crenshaw gave the government until noon Wednesday to give him evidence including, among other things, all documents reflecting government motivations behind the charging decision, as well as documents related to Ben Schrader, the former chief of the criminal division of the Tennessee office that brought the case. (Schrader’s resignation was reportedly prompted by the case being pursued for political reasons.) In a previous filing, the DOJ said Schrader had drafted a memo detailing why he wouldn’t bring the case, but the DOJ has argued that such evidence is “not properly subject to disclosure.”

Among the officials whom Abrego wants to subpoena for the upcoming hearing is Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the government’s attempt to quash the subpoena is being litigated this week.

These motions are generally difficult for defendants to win, though, as Crenshaw observed, this isn’t an “ordinary case.” But what “American justice looks like” at the moment is the administration having to justify how it brought it in the first place.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251028-pam-bondi-abrego-garcia-zz-568555.jpg",N,,2025-10-28 14:57:41.297478

Tuesday morning, the school district sent a message to all staff and families to offer counseling services, Sluis said.","Dozens of protesters remained outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango on Tuesday morning, after demonstrating through the night over reports that federal agents had detained two children and their father on the way to school.

The children, ages 12 and 15, and their father were taken Monday morning by ICE agents who pulled them over near a mobile home park at the edge of town, said Enrique Orozco-Perez, executive director of Compañeros, Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

A legal representative is working with the family on their asylum case and it remains active, Orozco-Perez said.

“Our legal representative went to the ICE office and presented the paperwork. ICE refused the paperwork and refused to give up the kids,” he said. “At a minimum, we were asking for the children and to be reunited with their mother.”

Fernando Jaramillo Solano, his 12-year-old daughter, Jana Michel Jaramillo Patiño and 15-year-old son Kewin Daniel Patiño Bustamante are asylum seekers from Colombia who have lived in Colorado for more than 18 months, Compañeros said in a letter to Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper posted on social media Tuesday morning.

None of the detained family members have a criminal record or history of non-compliance with ICE reporting requirements, the center said.

“We respectfully request that your offices contact ICE immediately to advocate for the release of Mr. Jaramillo and his two minor children while their asylum case proceeds. The family poses no flight risk and has substantial community support and housing in place,” the center said.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment when asked about the reported arrests on the phone Tuesday morning. An email with questions was not immediately returned.

About 60 to 70 demonstrators remained outside the building, at 32 Sheppard Dr., chanting “Let the kids go!” Orozco-Perez said. Orozco-Perez, who works directly with immigrant communities in Durango, is in Minneapolis for personal business, but is receiving live updates from people at the protest, he said.

“Causing good trouble,” he said. “Everything legal, everything followed by the Constitution, freedom of speech.”

About 7 a.m. Monday, Compañeros received a report that one of its members was pulled over on the side of the road by masked people wearing police vests, he said. Two people from the center’s Rapid Response Network went to the area to document ICE activity.

“They were detaining a gentleman who kept screaming in Spanish that his kids are in the back of the car. When our volunteers started asking about the kids, they were able to find out that their mother lived near there and that because of the mother’s status, she too was afraid to go over there,” Orozco-Perez said.

ICE refused to let the children go with the representatives from the resource center and instead handcuffed them and placed them inside the back of the car with their father, he said.

Protesters gathered outside the building at 11 a.m. Monday and swelled to 200, he said. People took shifts, in groups of at least 50, to keep vigil through the night.

On Monday night, a legal representative from Compañeros received a call from the children’s mother, who said she heard from one of her children saying that ICE was sending them to Texas and their father to the detention center in Aurora.

“The point is to get this as far and wide as possible, so people can see the cruelty that’s happening in real time and see that kids who are just trying to get an education, which is their their right for living in this country that’s being trampled on,” Orozco-Perez said. “We’re literally taking away kids being kids.”

Sluis did not confirm that the children attended school in the district, citing privacy concerns.

Tuesday morning, the school district sent a message to all staff and families to offer counseling services, Sluis said. The district has bilingual parent liaisons who are working with families, she said.

Perlmutter is the latest official whose firing has reached the Supreme Court.","The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to let President Trump refire the director of the U.S. Copyright Office, after a divided federal appeals court panel allowed her to remain in her post.

The Justice Department filed an emergency application at the high court Monday asking the justices to pause the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision blocking Trump’s termination of Shira Perlmutter as the case proceeds.

“This application involves another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s power to remove executive officers — here, the Register of Copyrights,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the administration’s request.

Perlmutter was fired in May after releasing a report that questioned whether companies can legally train artificial intelligence models using copyrighted materials.

As Trump sought to remove her, he also fired the Librarian of Congress, to whom Perlmutter reported, and installed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to take the helm.

Though Perlmutter lost before a district judge, the appeals panel ruled 2-1 that her firing was likely unlawful and blocked it until the court resolves the case. The majority argued that the executive branch has “no authority to punish a legislative branch official for the advice that she provides to Congress.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, wrote in a dissenting opinion that he would not have allowed Perlmutter to remain in her position while she challenges the legality of her removal because the Register of Copyrights exercises executive power. He noted that the Supreme Court has “repeatedly and unequivocally” stayed lower court injunctions barring Trump from firing officers exercising executive power.

The justices requested a response from Perlmutter by Nov. 10.

Sauer argued that the appeals court’s ruling marked a “startling about-face” of its previous determinations that the Library of Congress and librarian fall within the executive branch.

“As in past cases where lower courts have impaired the President’s constitutional authority to oversee executive agencies, this Court should grant a stay: the case is certworthy, the President had authority to direct respondent’s removal, the D.C. Circuit lacked equitable authority to reinstate her, and the balance of equities favors the government,” he wrote.

Perlmutter contends in the lawsuit challenging her firing that Trump had no power to fire her and Blanche was unlawfully installed, meaning he had no authority to effectuate her removal either.

She’s represented by Democracy Forward, a prolific challenger of Trump administration actions. The Hill requested comment.

Perlmutter is the latest official whose firing has reached the Supreme Court. The justices are slated to hear arguments in two such cases in coming weeks: Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter’s removal will be weighed in December, and Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook’s firing will be heard in January.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP24318853676620-e1761591195174.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-28 15:57:25.147166

A Muslim civil rights group said his arrest was retaliation for his criticism of Israel.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, announced on social media that Hamdi’s visa had been revoked, that he was being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he could be removed. In her post, she also made unsubstantiated claims that Hamdi supported terrorism.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote in her Sunday social media post.

Hamdi, who is based in London, had been on a speaking tour in the United States, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights advocacy group. His visitor visa was supposed to last for several months, a leader at the organization said.

The group said in a statement that Hamdi had been detained “because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide” while on his tour, and called his detention “a blatant affront to free speech.”

Hamdi had attended the organization’s annual gala on Friday night in Sacramento and was scheduled to speak at an event in Florida on Sunday night.

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British television networks to analyze developments in the Middle East, as well as domestic U.K. politics. According to his LinkedIn page, he is the managing director and editor in chief of International Interest, which “advises on political environments across the globe.”

Hamdi appears to be the latest of several immigrants and international travelers to have a U.S. visa revoked over political speech. The Trump administration was rebuked in September by a federal judge, who ruled that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had unconstitutionally targeted noncitizens for their pro-Palestinian advocacy in order to suppress critiques of Israel and the war it has waged in Gaza for two years with backing from the U.S.

Hussam Ayloush, chief executive of CAIR’s California chapter, said he attended the Sacramento gala with Hamdi and was shocked to receive a text from him Sunday around 7 a.m. informing him that Hamdi had been stopped by federal agents who told him he had to come with them.

Ayloush visited Hamdi along with two attorneys on Monday afternoon at the Golden State Annex, an ICE detention center in McFarland, where he is being held.

“When I went inside to meet him and check on him, I felt embarrassed that my country treated him that way,” Ayloush said. “He hasn’t caused or instigated any harm to our country.”

Ayloush said Hamdi was only guilty of “being critical of what Israel is doing to Palestinians, and the complicit role the U.S. government has played.”

CAIR said that its legal team as well as attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America were working toward Hamdi’s release.

The organization said Hamdi’s arrest came after pressure from right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who publicly took credit for his detention. She said on social media that ICE acted in response to her “relentless pressure.” Loomer had smeared Hamdi with anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, the organization said.

Loomer has said she successfully lobbied the U.S. government to bar Palestinian children injured by American weapons in Israel’s war from seeking medical care in the U.S. In August, the Trump administration announced it had stopped approving visitor visas for Palestinians from Gaza, including young children in need of serious medical care.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0810fa7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+346/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fae%2F6a7bc40b40059a5565a976580c43%2Fgettyimages-2187203810.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:03:11.031730

Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing.
Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age 14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says.
He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.
His team alleges that his detainment is, in part, retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.","A 38-year-old man who has been protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program for the past 12 years was detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this month, with the agency citing his social media posts as the reason for terminating his DACA status.

Yaa’kub Ira Vijandre, whose legal name is Jacob Ira Azurin Vijandre, is a Filipino immigrant, freelance journalist and activist in the Dallas area who was detained October 7, 2025, while leaving his home for work.

Vijandre is one of several immigrants who have been detained this year after speaking out against the war in Gaza, including students Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, and British commentator Sami Hamdi, who was detained over the weekend while on a speaking tour.

In addition to opposing the war in Gaza, Vijandre also spoke out against human rights abuses at ICE facilities and “the US government’s inhumane and illegal treatment of those it accuses of terrorism,” his attorneys said in a statement.

His detainment came a day after he recorded and participated in a local city council meeting in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, Texas, where he gave vocal support for a local community leader who was detained by ICE, according to a court filing from his legal team Monday.

His attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition Monday, arguing their client is being unlawfully detained and asking the court for his release.

Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing. Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age 14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says. He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement shared with CNN Monday that Vijandre posted content on his social media “glorifying terrorism,” and said he supported groups such as the Holy Land Foundation, a former US-based Muslim charity where five members were convicted in a contested series of trials on charges of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for Hamas.

Monday’s filing denies Vijandre has supported terrorism, and argues his First and Fifth amendment rights have been violated and the court should order his release and provide injunctive relief to prevent “further unlawful detention.”

Speech is “plainly protected by the First Amendment”

On the morning of October 7, Vijandre was leaving his home in Arlington, Texas, when ICE agents arrested him while at least one officer pointed a handgun at him, Monday’s filing said.

A Notice of Intent to Terminate DACA dated September 22 was sent to Vijandre and found in his mailbox several days after he was detained by ICE, according to the filing.

The notice alleges Vijandre supported “organizations and individuals who are known to engage in acts of terrorism,” which “presents public safety, national security concerns, and is a significant negative discretionary factor under the totality of the circumstances analysis,” Monday’s habeas filing said.

His legal team argues DHS is conflating supporting terrorism with Vijandre’s “opposition to U.S. foreign policy, the policies of the Israeli government, and abuse of prisoners with support for terrorism,” the filing says.

“In each of the three cases listed above, what Respondents characterize as support for terrorism actually consists of opposing perceived violation of detainee rights, including at black site prisons like Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Force Base,” the habeas petition says. “Equating such speech to ‘terrorism’ to justify detention would risk criminalizing a broad array of protected speech critical of U.S. government policy engaged in by citizens and non-citizens alike.”

Even if the speech did support terrorism, “such speech is plainly protected by the First Amendment,” the filing says, and the speech referenced by DHS “unquestionably fails this test regardless of whatever grounds of removability Respondents ultimately charge Mr. Vijandre in his Notice to Appear.”

Vijandre is not charged or convicted of any crime, his attorneys said.

Attempted recruitment by FBI

His detainment also comes after he was approached by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and asked to act as a confidential informant shortly after the Israel-Gaza conflict started in 2023, the filing says.

On or around November 30, 2023, agents approached Vijandre, indicating they wanted to recruit him as a confidential informant, and allegedly said he was “a poster child for the way you’re supposed to do it” in an apparent reference to immigration status, the filing says. He declined the offer, according to the filing.

A form called a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien provided to Vijandre’s attorneys said that he was a “subject of interest to the [FBI’s] Dallas Join (sic) Terrorism Task Force” at an unspecified time, and the FBI initiated a review of his immigration record, the filing says.

His team alleges that his detainment is, in part, retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.

Vijandre’s attorneys ring alarm bells

Attorneys representing Vijandre raised alarm bells about the implications of their client’s detainment, saying in Monday’s filing that “important democratic principles are at stake.”

This is another example in a string of cases this year in which the Trump administration is aiming to root out any immigrants it views as unpatriotic, and specifically associate those who are pro-Palestinian as being anti-American, said Marium Uddin, an attorney representing Vijandre and Legal Director of the Muslim Legal Fund of America.

They appear to target people expressing dissent, which is disturbing from a legal perspective but also “incredibly scary as a country,” she said, adding that is testing whether our legal systems will stay intact and follow decades of legal precedent.

Eric Lee, another attorney representing Vijandre, said his legal team meticulously analyzed their client’s social media presence and believe the government has failed to come close to satisfying imminent incitement, a legal precedent used to decide if speech is protected under the first amendment.

The legal team is confident based on their review, and believe the Trump administration is looking to expand the definition of domestic terrorism despite their client’s protected speech about things like ICE enforcement and inhumane detention at places like Guantanamo Bay.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2195569262-20251028020915858.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-28 13:03:15.093098

DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection did not confirm or deny the personnel changes.","EXCLUSIVE — The Trump administration has begun to purge Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in offices in five major U.S. cities and fill some of those top posts with senior Border Patrol agents who will take over interior immigration enforcement in those regions, according to five sources familiar with the plans.

ICE leaders in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San Diego were relieved of their jobs and moved to other posts within the federal agency last Friday, the Washington Examiner has learned.

Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security quietly started overhauling how it carries out its mass deportation operation in hopes of netting more arrests and ratcheting up its flashy, high-profile deportation campaign. The five cities are believed to be the first of more to come across ICE’s 24 field offices nationwide, according to three officials.

One official with firsthand knowledge of the plans, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity, said the plan goes far beyond the five cities.

“It’s a lot more,” the official said.

A total of five sources said the five field office directors had been relieved of their duties and sent to other parts of the country to work. That included Denver Field Office Director Robert Guadian.

Guadian was told over the weekend that he would be reassigned from his duties, according to an informed source who wished not to be identified for fear of losing his job. The source said that Guidien informed his staff of the development on Monday.

The DHS had plotted to fire all five field office directors but relented amid pushback from acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, who pleaded that they not be terminated.

“The administration wanted all these guys fired and Todd stepped in and said, ‘Let’s move them all to headquarters,'” the second official said. Lyons did not respond to a request for comment.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem would have the final say in personnel matters at ICE and Border Patrol. The DHS did not comment on Noem’s role in the personnel changes.

“I personally think this is being pushed by Noem and [DHS senior adviser Corey Lewandowski] because they don’t like [White House border czar Tom Homan]. I think Tom would have said, ‘No way,'” the second official said.

The decision to replace top federal employees from one agency with employees from an entirely different agency is unprecedented.

The DHS had initially dispatched Gregory Bovino, who oversees the Border Patrol’s El Centro, California, region, to help with immigration arrests in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland since the start of summer.

Bovino has become the face of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime for his aggressive style, leading Border Patrol agents in a parade down the streets of Chicago’s business district and standing face to face with fiery rioters and protesters. He has also brought in Border Patrol agents to supplement ICE efforts.

Now, the second official explained, Bovino is not viewed as the exception to the norm, but the new standard for what is to come at ICE.

The other four officials pushed out from their posts besides Guadian were San Diego Field Office Director Patrick Divver, Phoenix Field Office Director John Cantu, Los Angeles Field Office Director Ernesto Santacruz, and Philadelphia’s acting Field Office Director Brian McShane. All five did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson from the Denver ICE office did not respond for comment as if this story’s publication.

Guidian came to Denver from Chicago, where he held the same position leading operations for Enforcement and Removal operations.

During his short tenure in Denver, he led an ICE operation in July which ended up in 243 arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Denver metro area. Of those arrested, ICE said that nine were members of violent gangs including Tren de Aragua and their crimes ranged from murder to human trafficking and drug offenses.

At the time, Guidian claimed that many of those who were detained had been previously released into the Denver metro area by the local county jails “because of Colorado’s sanctuary laws that prevent sheriffs from cooperating with ICE.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has pushed for a high level of arrests and deportations. At present, the Trump administration anticipates hitting 600,000 deportations by January 2026.

In May, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller pushed ICE to arrest 3,000 illegal immigrants per day, which would work out to more than 1 million arrests in a year.

In a heated exchange at ICE’s Washington headquarters between Miller, Noem, and ICE leadership in May, the administration officials berated ICE for not doing more to arrest illegal immigrants.

But those high figures have been impossible to achieve as ICE has simultaneously focused on arresting the “worst of the worst,” often a one-by-one process.

Now, DHS is bringing in regional chiefs and supervisors normally stationed at the nation’s borders to carry out immigration arrests inside the country. Normally, Border Patrol’s authority only extends 100 miles into the U.S. from the border, though it is not clear what jurisdiction agents have to be enforcing immigration law in cities.

In mid-October, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told the Washington Examiner that agents were already assisting ICE in 27 cities nationwide, far beyond the two where agents have mostly been seen this fall: Chicago and Portland.

DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection did not confirm or deny the personnel changes.

“While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in an email Monday.

The overhaul affects ICE field offices in at least eight cities and will replace many senior leaders with Border Patrol officials, marking an unprecedented power shift inside DHS and exposing sharp divisions over how far to go in ramping up deportations, the officials told Fox News.

The changes are being driven by competing camps inside DHS.

On one side are Border Czar Tom Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons, who have advocated focusing on criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.

On the other side are DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who have pushed for a broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the US illegally to boost deportation numbers.

Two senior officials described the mood inside DHS as “tense” and “combative,” with some ICE leaders warning the new approach could erode public support and blur the line between ICE and Border Patrol operations.

“ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,” one senior DHS official told Fox. “It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?”

Another senior official put it bluntly, “ICE is arresting criminal aliens. They [Border Patrol] are hitting Home Depots and car washes.”

Border Patrol agents have defended the new strategy.

“What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst?” one agent told Fox News. “Tom Homan has said it himself — anyone in the US illegally is on the table.”

The internal friction comes as deportation totals remain below targets set by the administration earlier this year. Officials told Fox News that the latest round of reassignments impacts ICE field chiefs in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Philadelphia, El Paso and New Orleans — positions expected to be filled by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.

A separate DHS official confirmed the personnel changes, describing them as “performance-based” and designed “to move people around for the best results.”

Dive Brief:

The Iowa Department of Education and the state’s Board of Educational Examiners are being audited after U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement took former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts into custody last month for allegedly staying and working in the country illegally.

The state auditor will review the entities’ licensing and background check procedures, as well as audit Iowa’s Des Moines Public Schools, according to information shared with K-12 Dive by the state auditor’s office.

Meanwhile, the state’s largest school district announced earlier this month that it is suing JG Consulting, the search firm that Des Moines School Board tapped to help with its superintendent search in 2022-23 and facilitated the hiring of Roberts in 2023.

Dive Insight:

Roberts’ arrest by ICE on Sept. 26 is one of the most high-profile apprehensions in the K-12 sector to result from the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, which has impacted school communities nationwide and has even changed schools’ daily operations in some places like Chicago. Roberts has served in educator and school leadership positions for over two decades in the U.S., according to the Des Moines school district.

His apprehension by immigration enforcement officials raised questions about the hiring and vetting processes in place at the state and district levels.

The Iowa state department of education audit was launched after a request by state Sen. Tony Bisignano from Des Moines, who said in an Oct. 22 letter to state auditor Rob Sand that the arrest of Roberts “raise[s] serious concerns about the integrity and effectiveness of the Board’s licensing processes.

“This incident represents a glaring oversight and suggests a potential failure in either the background check protocol itself or in the implementation and review process,” said Bisignano, adding that “public trust” is on the line.

Bisignano also requested that the use of third-party contracts by the board be reviewed.

Since 2001, Roberts filed repeated green card applications, which is also known as a Permanent Resident Card, which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rejected, according to ICE. In 2019, he filed for employment authorization documents, which was approved with an expiration date of Dec. 18, 2020. By 2024, an immigration judge had ordered Roberts to be deported.

Des Moines Public School district said in a Sept. 30 statement that Roberts wrote he was a U.S. citizen on his I-9 employment form and that he provided a driver’s license and Social Security card as two forms of identification. His arrest also raised concerns about his qualifications, including his doctorate degree from Morgan State University in Maryland.

Following his arrest, Roberts submitted a letter of resignation to the district through his attorney, which the Des Moines School Board accepted. His license allowing him to practice as superintendent was revoked by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in the days following his arrest.

The district maintained in an Oct. 1 statement that it was a “victim of deception” by Roberts.

The district’s lawsuit against JG Consulting claims the firm failed to properly vet Roberts in violation of their contract and was negligent when it represented Roberts as a suitable candidate for the superintendency. The district is seeking an undetermined amount of damages, including the costs of superintendent pay.

In 2023, the Des Moines school system paid Roberts a base salary of $270,000, according to district documentation.
