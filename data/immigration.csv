(AP) — A pair of lawsuits seeking to redraw congressional boundary lines that currently favor Republicans in Wisconsin are on track to be resolved after the 2026 midterms, even as attorneys for one case argued Friday in court that there’s still time to enact new maps for the November election.

Court hearings in both cases came the day after Indiana Republicans soundly rejected President Donald Trump’s demand that they redraw congressional lines in that deep red state. Trump is waging a national redistricting battle as he tries to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year’s elections.

WATCH: Indiana Republican explains why he defied Trump and rejected congressional redistricting

An attorney for Democrats who brought one of the Wisconsin challenges argued for the panel to issue a ruling by around March 1, the deadline given by the state elections commission in order to have new maps in place.

“It’s absolutely possible,” Julie Zuckerbrod, an attorney with the liberal Elias Law Group, told a three-judge panel in support of the more aggressive timing.

But Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese pushed back on the pressure to act quickly.

“We’ll decide them when we can decide them,” she said of the pending motions to issue a ruling or dismiss the case without further arguments.

Attorneys for Wisconsin’s six Republican congressmen and other conservative defendants pushed for a schedule that would not result in a trial until March 2027.

“Seeking relief in time for the 2026 election would be unfair,” said Kevin LeRoy, an attorney for the congressmen.

The three-judge panel in that case will first decide early next year whether to dismiss the case or rule in favor of those who brought it without further argument.

Both of the Wisconsin cases are before newly assigned three-judge panels, the first time that process has been used under a 2011 law enacted by Republicans. The dual hearings on Friday afternoon were two hours and two floors apart in the same courthouse, just blocks from the state Capitol.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court last month ordered that the redistricting cases be first heard by the three-judge panel over objections from Republicans.

The three-judge panel hearing the case brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders set a potential trial date for April 5, 2027, if the case survives a motion to dismiss.

Any final rulings of those panels on the merits of the cases can be appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy argues in its lawsuit that Wisconsin’s congressional maps are unconstitutional because they are an anti-competitive gerrymander. The lawsuit notes that the median margin of victory for candidates in the eight districts since the maps were enacted is close to 30 percentage points.

“In a 50-50 state, it makes no sense that 75% of Wisconsin seats in the House of Representatives are controlled by one party,” Law Forward said in a summary of its lawsuit on its website.

The other case, filed on behalf of Democratic voters, contends the current maps discriminate against Democrats. They do so by packing a substantial number of Democrats into two districts while breaking up other Democratic areas into six Republican-favorable districts.

In 2010, the year before Republicans redrew the congressional maps, Democrats held five seats compared with three for Republicans. Republicans hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats, but only two are considered competitive.

The current congressional maps, which were based on the ones drawn in 2010, were approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservative judges. The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.

A top target for Democrats is the western Wisconsin seat held by Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden. He won in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired. Van Orden won reelection in the 3rd District in 2024.

The other seat Democrats are hoping to make more competitive is southeastern Wisconsin’s 1st District, held by Republican Rep. Bryan Steil since 2019. The latest maps made that district more competitive while still favoring Republicans.

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Rep. Omar demanded immediate answers regarding Operation Metro Surge, an ICE deployment to the Twin Cities that has resulted in widespread racial profiling, unlawful arrests of U.S. citizens, excessive force, and violations of constitutional rights.

Rep. Omar’s letter cites multiple documented incidents in which ICE agents detained people who had identified themselves as U.S. citizens, mocked a woman for wearing a hijab, used pepper spray on bystanders, and refused to provide warrants while carrying out arrests near homes, schools, and a university campus. The New York Times also reported that approximately 100 ICE agents were deployed to Minnesota, at significant taxpayer expense.

In a second letter sent to Secretary Noem, Rep. Omar led Members of Congress in demanding a full explanation of the administration’s threat to abruptly terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali nationals in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Trump publicly claimed he would end TPS for Somalis “effective immediately,” and DHS officials echoed these statements despite a longstanding federal law governing TPS designations. Somalia has been designated for TPS since 1991 due to ongoing humanitarian crises. Ending TPS would put lives at risk and tear apart families who have lived, worked, and contributed to our communities for decades.

The letter, co-led by Representatives Adam Smith(WA-09), Joyce Beatty(OH-03), Betty McCollum (MN-04), Angie Craig (MN-02), Yvette Clarke (NY-09), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Jared Golden (ME-02), Kelly Morrison (MN-03), and Chellie Pingree (ME-01), requests detailed explanations of the legal basis for terminating TPS, the administration’s assessment of current conditions in Somalia, consultations with humanitarian experts, and the potential consequences for regional stability.

The Migrant Rights Network opposes C-12, the Strengthening Canada’s Immigration System and Borders Act.

The Bill allows decisions to be made about ‘national interest’ projects with little public participation, without robust environmental impact assessments, and without the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples.”

Greenpeace Canada has also explained: “Bill C5 (the Building Canada Act) is likely going to result in a new round of grassroots opposition from Indigenous land defenders and environmental activists to resource extraction projects fast-tracked under the new legislation.”

And they noted: “Bill C2 (the Strong Borders Act) grants the federal government new warrant-less surveillance powers that are not restricted to border-related issues, but can be used any time there is even a suspicion that any Act of Parliament might be contravened.”

Greenpeace further highlights: “The history of RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] surveillance and repression of land defenders (particularly but not exclusively Indigenous) suggest that these powers will be misused.”

We are also watching MP Jenny Kwan’s Bill C-233.

The Canadian Press has reported: “Her private member’s bill C-233, which she’s calling the “No More Loopholes Act,” would add new oversight requirements to exports of parts and components, end permit-free access to the United States for military goods and require companies to obtain end-use certificates from foreign governments. …Debate on the bill is expected to resume in the new year, likely in February.”

PBI-Canada has commented that Bill C-233 would complement the Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act in the protection of defenders that is backed by the PBI-Honduras accompanied Lenca organization COPINH.

When language is weaponized to erase racial justice and cement racial hierarchy, the very foundation of justice begins to crack.","On December 2, 2025, President Donald Trump held a cabinet meeting wherein he verbally attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, calling her “garbage,” and Somalia, the nation she came from, “barely a country.” These words reflect a continued effort to revive race and origin as tools to divide and dictate policy.

In 2017, Trump’s Muslim Ban targeted multiple Muslim-majority nations, including Somalia, under the guise of “national security.” In 2018, he asked why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries,” instead of “places like Norway.” In 2019, he told four U.S. citizens — women of color in Congress, including Rep. Omar — to “go back” to the countries they came from.

Branding African nations as “shithole countries” and Somalia as “barely a country” perpetuates centuries-old narratives that frame majority-Black nations and Black people as inferior and undesirable. Trump’s threat to “permanently pause migration” would disproportionately target African nations, echoing the racial quotas of the 1920s and reinforcing a hierarchy that places whiteness at the center of American belonging. This is the same ideology that once justified slavery, Jim Crow and immigration laws crafted to keep Black people out of America’s promise.

How the History of American Citizenship is Rooted in Anti-Black Policies

Trump’s recent words are part of a long pattern of messaging. His infamous racist slogan, “Make America Great Again,” is a continuum of the Ku Klux Klan’s “America for Americans,” and President Calvin Coolidge’s declaration that “America must remain American,” which then, as now, is a coded affirmation of racial violence and hierarchy that reflects a vision of “America” rooted in whiteness, Anglo-Saxon heritage and Protestant norms.

While the Naturalization Act of 1790 established the rules for U.S. citizenship, it explicitly limited naturalization to “free white persons,” excluding Black Americans and other non-white individuals. This was a deliberate attempt to block enslaved persons and their descendants from laying claim to the land they were forced to live on and cultivate, fueling systemic discrimination and violence for generations. Seventy-six years later, the 14th Amendment introduced and sanctioned birthright citizenship as a corrective to anti-Black exclusion, finally guaranteeing citizenship to all people born on American soil.

However, Trump continues his futile attempt to rewrite history through a lily-white lens. His anti-immigration agenda seeks to undermine a constitutional principle rooted in racial justice. These efforts reveal how immigration policy has long been entangled with anti-Blackness and structural racism, not only through exclusionary laws, but also through narratives that criminalize Black immigrants and erase their contributions. Institutional racism embedded in immigration laws and enforcement has resulted in persistent inequitable outcomes.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned Chinese immigrants outright. Later laws, like the Immigration Act of 1917 and the Immigration Act of 1924, went even further, banning immigrants from large parts of Asia and setting quotas that favored Europeans. African immigration was almost impossible because quotas were based on existing U.S. populations, where Africans were barely represented due to earlier anti-Black policies.

How Racial Justice Fueled More Humane and Equitable Immigration Laws

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 removed explicit racial restrictions from immigration law. However, meaningful change only accelerated two years later with Brown v. Board of Education, when the concept of “separate but equal” was legally dismantled. In this instance, collective action challenged entrenched racism and expanded access to rights and opportunities for people of all races, helping spark what would be known as the Civil Rights Movement, which continues to this very moment in history. Fear-driven policies harm everyone, while inclusive policies — such as public education, healthcare access and economic stability — benefit all communities.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 followed the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, dismantling the racist quota system and laying the foundation for modern immigration policy that opened doors to immigrants from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Today, immigrants comprise nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population, compared to 5 percent in 1965. This shift has enriched American culture, fueled economic growth, and reinforced civil rights principles by embedding racial equality into immigration law.

While Trump attempted to disparage Rep. Omar and her racial background, her story embodies long-championed American ideals, demonstrating how resilience, opportunity and inclusion can transform lives. She fled civil war in Somalia, became a U.S. citizen and now serves in Congress. Her presence represents the promise of America: that refugees and immigrants not only contribute to, but are, in fact, the foundational pillars of, democracy and leadership

Why Immigration and Racial Justice are Foundational to Democracy

With the barrage of racialized insults and inflammatory language over the last decade of Trump’s rhetoric, it can be tempting to dismiss them for the sake of our collective sanity. But these words are designed to erode our sense of what is acceptable, making harmful actions more likely. We cannot afford to be complacent.

When language is weaponized to erase racial justice and cement racial hierarchy, the very foundation of justice begins to crack. This fascist rhetoric seeks to resurrect the ghosts of Jim Crow and carve inequality into the bedrock of our nation. But as Rep. Omar’s personal history attests, America’s strength lies in its diversity of all human experiences and backgrounds. The days of this country’s legalized caste system are over.

We no longer dream of an inclusive America. We demand it, we build it, and we will not settle for anything less than justice and inclusion for all. The National Immigration Law Center recognizes and asserts that people of all communities — especially those living at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality and ability — are people of inherent value.",https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DACA-ACABlog-Image-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 21:57:36.251263

The entire concept makes the skin prickle in reprehension. Yet here we are. ICE and CBP goons, balaclavas emphasizing the penis-like nature of their heads, have descended on New Orleans. Led by unapologetic Border Patrol boss Gregory Bovino, whose fascist high top haircut and affinity for dark double-breasted trenchcoats cross the line from “unintentionally Nazi-esque” into “Nazi on purpose,” they are all over the streets of America’s Friendliest City, vowing to deport 5,000 (!) people in the name of Purifying America’s Blood or some more publicly acceptable euphemism for that purpose. This is Operation “Catahoula Crunch,” which sounds like an AI-generated name for a Louisiana breakfast cereal. In the first three days of raids, they arrested 38 people, fewer than a third of whom had criminal records. Clearly, the motherfuckers are going to be here for a while. I went to take a look.

This article was originally published on the “how things work”substack. subscribe here for more of Hamilton nolan’s great work!

Friday night, hundreds of drunk kids staggered down Tulane University’s fraternity row, celebrating their football team’s conference championship. Inside a church a few blocks away was more serious business. Fifty or so people filled the pews. Projected on the wall was a slide that read “Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo.” Only the people can save the people. Only we can save us.

This was a training for Ojos, an ICE-watching project aligned with an immigrant support group called Unión Migrante. (Though ICE is only one of the agencies carrying out the raids, their name has become synonymous with this sort of persecution, and they are universally used as shorthand for la migra, the catchall term for immigration police.) As in Los Angeles, and Chicago, and North Carolina, New Orleans has, in a short time, built a remarkably sophisticated region-wide network of citizens ready to film the dirty dogs doing their work. There was an Ojos training like this every single night of the week in different neighborhoods around the city. Here, the regular people learned what they can do in the face of the terror.

The trainers told the crowd how to properly record ICE spottings: date and time, description, exact cross streets. This information can be spread instantly through a network of both citywide and neighborhood-specific group chats that hundreds or perhaps thousands of New Orleanians now participate in. If agents try to arrest someone in Metairie or Algiers or the Mid City or the West Bank, someone will see or hear and this information will in very short order be spread and investigated and verified and then posted online by Unión Migrante, the definitive source that immigrants can use to learn where the danger is today. For an effort that is run completely by volunteers and dependent on the zeal of regular, unpaid citizens, it is a fairly spectacular underground intelligence service.

The training featured an unwieldy role-playing exercise, with 20 people playing roles ranging from teachers to passersby to Ojos watchers, which mirrored the chaos of the actual work. (Those picked to play ICE officers seemed a little unhappy, but they did their duty.) All of us got little Ziploc bags with a whistle the size of a bullet that can be used to alert anyone within several square blocks of a raid in progress. For more than two hours, this earnest group of teachers and tattooed 20-somethings and retirees and musicians and business owners learned how to be cops on the side of righteousness. Then they took their places back in their city and waited for the feds to make their next move.

Once you get into it, the odd similarity between watching cops and being a cop is hard to miss. The primary method that Ojos uses is training enough volunteers that wherever something happens, someone plugged into their network is very likely to be nearby. But this will always mean that the bad thing has already happened once it gets reported. The most useful version of ICE watching would be to be able to track the agents, to monitor them in real time, to serve as an early warning system, to ruin their element of surprise. This is a much trickier proposition.

You could park your car outside the entrance of the Naval Station in Belle Chasse that the agents are using as their headquarters and try to track them when they emerge each morning. But they can be hard to identify, and even harder to follow. They have the assistance of local and state police as well—one Ojos activist was pulled over twice in one day by a Louisiana State Police officer demanding that he stop driving in the vicinity of a convoy of CBP vehicles.

Alternately, you could make an educated guess about where la migra might show up, go there in advance, and drive around hoping to catch them, becoming a funhouse mirror version of a cop patrolling a high crime area. I tried this myself one day. I spent hours driving around Kenner, a working-class New Orleans suburb out by the airport that has so far been the target of more immigration raids than anywhere else in the area. For hours on a rainy Saturday, I circled down Veterans Boulevard and up Williams, stopping at the obvious places where ICE tends to pop up. I went to all three Walmarts in the Kenner area. I went to Lowe’s. I went to Home Depot. I did not see any immigration officers, but I did see Spanish-speaking families out shopping in stores that had translated their signs into Spanish, but had conspicuously not taken any actions to indicate that they disapproved of their customers being kidnapped on their property. Contrast this with small businesses across New Orleans that have posted fliers on their doors declaring that ICE is not welcome there. It makes you think about corporate responsibility, and cowardice, and things of that nature.

Without two-person teams—one to drive, and one to navigate and monitor the chat and alerts and social media in real time—constantly on patrol in each neighborhood hot spot, it takes luck to catch officers in the act. Nor is it easy to know if you are parked right next to one. They tend to roll around in big American-made SUVs. Now go look at a Home Depot parking lot. See any big SUVs there, maybe with a burly guy wearing a baseball cap inside? Yeah. Everywhere!

I found myself peering hard at anyone who fit the profile. I hovered, camera ready, by an oversized white SUV with tinted windows and crash bars parked in front of Walmart, until the doors opened and an elderly Latino couple emerged. In downtown New Orleans, I crept up on a group of a half-dozen brawny white guys with beards, until it became clear that it was a group of gay tourists. Add to this the flood of well-intentioned people sharing rumors online—my friend saw a suspicious car parked outside this hotel, I wonder if they’re staying there?—and it becomes clear that ICE watching is a long game, and an imperfect science. It will require grace from all of us. As a white guy who looks a little bit like I could be a cop, I accept any future sideways looks I get as my tiny sacrifice for the cause.

Considering the challenges, Unión Migrante and Ojos are shockingly effective. Every day they blast out multiple sightings, photos, and videos, all verified and confirmed. Over time, it is likely that this kind of community intelligence will save lives and prevent some families from being torn apart. And, on a much shallower level, it is just satisfying to watch a video of an activist filming agents desperately trying to be inconspicuous in a parked SUV, walking by them and drawling, “I’m with Neighborhood Watch. You guys good? You guys need any help?”

The people of New Orleans are also registering their pissed-off-ness by holding protests against the immigration action on a near-daily basis. I went to one on Saturday night, on the steps of the Hale Boggs federal courthouse on Poydras Street. There were many “CBP OUT OF NEW ORLEANS!” signs and fliers for a teach-in about general strikes and constant honks of support from passing cars. A billboard for Zatarains loomed picturesquely across the street. A couple of right-wing Youtube trolls also attended, prancing around in front of speakers and shouting pro-deportation slogans and aggressively shoving cameras in unwilling people’s faces and generally acting like dickheads. One of these people, a weak-chinned MAGA darling named Nick Sortor, harassed a woman so insistently that a scuffle broke out. In any other setting, he would have gotten his ass kicked, but the security volunteers went out of their way not to do so, just trying to steer him away from people over and over as he cried about being assaulted. All of this while people who were immigrants and who faced very real risks of life-changing government oppression were giving brave and heartfelt speeches just steps away. It really drove home how rude Nazis are. Their own repulsive, racist glee indicts them more effectively than any outside critics ever could.

Before the spotlight descended on New Orleans this month, many had been toiling quietly for years trying to insulate immigrants from the predations of America’s deportation system. One of those people is Angela Davis—not the famous one who wrote Are Prisons Obsolete?, but an attorney who has spent the past decade running Project Ishmael, a nonprofit that gives legal support to immigrant children. In an office above a church off Canal Street, Davis told me that today’s outrages are different only in degree from what has come before.

She has done this work during the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. Though the work has changed, she said, “Under every single one of those presidents, many, many families are being separated, torn apart, and detained. That has not changed. The immense cruelty of the U.S. immigration system has been consistent.”

Under Biden, at least, her clients with Special Immigrant Juvenile status were able to get “deferred action,” a temporary protection that made it easier for them to work and live here while their applications for lawful permanent residency were processed. In April, the Trump administration ended deferred action and began arresting people, including some of Davis’s clients. Though Project Ishmael’s services are in high demand, it is harder for them to take on new cases now, because every single case requires so much more work than it did when the government was somewhat less hostile.

To have militarized raids layered on top of the bureaucratic hurdles adds an almost surreal level of hardship to New Orleans immigrants’ lives. “People are scared to leave their home,” she says. “We’ve all read Anne Frank, and have very clear images of what it looks like to be in an attic afraid of forces of terror out in your streets. And that is what it is like. Something not too dissimilar.” Davis carries on with her work, though she admits that she has doubts about how faithfully the government will adhere to the rule of law. “There are still wins in courts, and some of them are still enforceable. There are also many things the government just doesn’t follow,” she says.

On my way out, she gave me a copy of the organization’s summer newsletter. In it was a story that a client from Honduras had written in her own words about her experience as an immigrant. She entered the country in 2018, and was imprisoned and separated from her five year old daughter for a month and a half. After being released and reunited, her son joined them here, and she has been dutifully going to all of her immigration appointments for the past seven years. Then, in May of this year, ICE put an ankle monitor on her to track her movements, and began demanding she go to more appointments, making it hard for her to earn enough money to survive. She began living in fear that ICE would track her down and arrest her on the street if she went out.

“If they did that, they could send you away without your children, so it was better for me to leave the United States. I feared for my life returning to Honduras, but I feared being separated from my children again more. I know the United States is about opportunity and I am grateful for my time here, but life is also too stressful and exhausting,” she wrote. She made the decision to risk her life and leave America, rather than risking losing her family. “On our flight back to Honduras, there were five families with me who had deported themselves.”

This, from our current government’s perspective, is a success story. To harass and persecute and terrorize a mother so fiercely that she chooses to bring her children back to an impoverished country where they may be killed is the best possible outcome that Stephen Miller and Gregory Bovino and their nationwide army of masked raiders could hope for. This is what they are about. This is what they accomplish. This is what their legacy will be. This is what they will have to declare at the gates of heaven, or hell.

The most memorable video from the New Orleans immigration sweeps is one taken last week in a residential neighborhood in Kenner, which instantly became famous. It shows federal agents with rifles surrounding a house where men are repairing a roof. As the cops hop out of their cars and approach, one of the roofers snatches the ladder and yanks it up, setting up an hours-long standoff between the agents on the ground and the men working above, unwilling to come down. The men on the roof reportedly got away in the end.

The symbolism in that clip is almost too perfect: hardworking immigrants escaping deportation by pulling up the ladder behind themselves. But I’m pretty sure that the ICE and CBP agents, all children of people who were immigrants at one time or another, are too dumb to see it.",https://www.currentaffairs.org/hubfs/fuck-ice-nola.webp,N,,2025-12-12 23:56:36.499098

According to data from the Deportation Project, between 2024 and until October 2025, the number of ICE arrests in Onondaga County increased from 56 to 161. Erie County saw an increase from 59 to 620 arrests; Albany County went from 20 to 190; and Monroe from 6 to 224 this year.

In Onondaga County, 42 of the 161 people arrested by ICE were from Ecuador, 27 from Guatemala and 17 from Cuba, and over 80% were men. The data shows 114 of those were deemed “other immigration violator” and 47 had pending criminal charges or criminal convictions. Thirty-six of the 114 without criminal charges have been deported to their originating countries.

The New York Immigration Coalition analyzed the data available through the Deportation Project, which collects and posts data from ICE obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and found that people from Central and South America make up 25% of the immigrant population in New York, but account for 74% of ICE arrests.

“For example, Ecuadorians are 4% of non-citizens in New York state but they are 24.9% of ICE arrests,” said Mario Bruzzone, vice president of the NYIC, during a press conference Wednesday.

The data from the Deportation Project doesn’t include arrests by U.S. Border Patrol agents, so Cayuga County is listed as only having eight ICE detainments even though 57 were detained in Cato following the raid, and Oswego County has five. There is data available on the number of arrests by Border Patrol, but it isn’t broken down by county.

There are eight counties that have 287(g) agreements that allow local law enforcement agencies to work with federal agents, according to ICE's website. Broome, Madison, Nassau, Steuben, Otsego and Niagara all have warrant service officer agreements, meaning that local law enforcement officers can execute administrative immigration warrants on people in their jail systems.

Along with the warrant service agreement, Nassau, Steuben and Niagara counties have task force 287(g) agreements that allow local law enforcement to make immigrant arrests during routine police activities. Cattaraugus County and Camden Police Department, a city department in Oneida County, also have this type of agreement in place.

In 2024, Cattaraugus County had zero ICE arrests but from January to October of 2025, they’ve had 10.

Rensselaer County has a jail enforcement model agreement that allows correctional officers in local jails to interrogate people about their immigration status and notify federal agencies.

On Sept. 4, Cayuga County Sheriff’s deputies worked with federal agents to assist with traffic outside of a raid at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners factory in Cato. The county does not have a 287(g) agreement in place, but following the raid, Sheriff Brian Schenck said they have had a relationship with Border Patrol agents since 2009.

“During my entire career, our agency has always been committed to assisting our local, state and federal agencies in conducting criminal investigations, and this case was no exception,” Schenck said in a statement in September.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UNY-Spec-EmilyKenny-Rally-20251124-001,N,,2025-12-12 19:57:39.433327

The framework rescinds the 2024 CBA between TSA and the American Federation of Government Employees, the agency said.
But in response to longstanding concerns about TSA attrition, then-TSA Administrator David Pekoske in 2022 issued a determination that expanded collective bargaining at the agency to mirror the bargaining rights under Title 5.
TSA and AFGE then negotiated and signed a seven-year collective bargaining agreement last year.
The agreement established a streamlined process for grievance and arbitration, expanded official time, fewer restrictions on sick leave, increased uniform allowances and opportunities for local collective bargaining.","The Department of Homeland Security is again moving to rescind a collective bargaining agreement with Transportation Security Administration employees, despite an ongoing court case over DHS’ prior move to eliminate the TSA union agreement.

In a Dec. 12 press release, TSA announced that a new “labor framework” would be implemented starting Jan. 11, 2026. The framework rescinds the 2024 CBA between TSA and the American Federation of Government Employees, the agency said.

TSA said the decision is based on a Sept. 29 determination by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, “Eliminating Collective Bargaining at TSA Due to its Incompatibility with TSA’s National Security Mission and its Adverse Impact on Resources, Flexibility, Mission Focus, Security Effectiveness, and Traveler Experience.”

TSA said Noem’s determination — which it did not release — “establishes that employees performing security screening functions … have a primary function of national security and shall not engage in collective bargaining or be represented for any purposes by any representative or organization.”

Noem also determined that collective bargaining for TSA officers “is inconsistent with efficient stewardship of taxpayer dollars and impedes the agility required to secure the traveling public,” according to the agency statement.

“Our Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) need to be focused on their mission of keeping travelers safe not wasting countless hours on non-mission critical work,” Adam Stahl, senior official performing the duties of TSA deputy administrator, said in the press release. “Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, we are ridding the agency of wasteful and time-consuming activities that distracted our officers from their crucial work.”

AFGE quickly criticized TSA’s announcement. AFGE represents approximately 47,000 airport screeners under the CBA.

“Merely 30 days ago, Secretary Noem celebrated TSA officers for their dedication during the longest government shutdown in history,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said as part of a statement. “Today, she’s announcing a lump of coal right on time for the holidays: that she’s stripping those same dedicated officers of their union rights.”

AFGE noted that a federal judge earlier this year blocked DHS from dissolving the collective bargaining agreement. The union had brought the lawsuit in response to a previous determination issued by Noem that sought to dissolve the CBA.

In granting the preliminary injunction in June, the judge presiding over the case wrote that Noem’s previous attempt to dissolve the CBA “appears to have been undertaken to punish AFGE and its members because AFGE has chosen to push back against the Trump Administration’s attacks to federal employment in the courts.”

That ongoing case is currently scheduled to go to trial next September.

Kelley said AFGE “will continue to challenge these illegal attacks on our members’ right to belong to a union.” He also urged the Senate to pass the Protect America’s Workforce Act “immediately.”

TSA staff don’t have the same statutory rights as other federal employees under Title 5 of U.S. Code. But in response to longstanding concerns about TSA attrition, then-TSA Administrator David Pekoske in 2022 issued a determination that expanded collective bargaining at the agency to mirror the bargaining rights under Title 5.

TSA and AFGE then negotiated and signed a seven-year collective bargaining agreement last year. The agreement established a streamlined process for grievance and arbitration, expanded official time, fewer restrictions on sick leave, increased uniform allowances and opportunities for local collective bargaining.

In a statement today, AFGE Council 100 President Hydrick Thomas called the decision to revoke the CBA a “slap in the face” to TSA employees

“Prior to having a union contract, many employees endured hostile work environments and workers felt like they didn’t have a voice on the job, which led to severe attrition rates and longer wait times for the traveling public,” Thomas said. “Since having a contract, we’ve seen a more stable workforce, and there has never been another aviation-related attack on our country.”

In its statement, TSA said that agency policy will govern “employment matters previously addressed by the 2024 CBA, and TSA policy will provide for alternative procedures to ensure that employee voices are heard and that legitimate concerns are resolved quickly.”

“An immigration judge (IJ) denied Jovita Cruz-Lopez’s application for cancellation of removal, but granted her request for voluntary departure. The IJ found that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the statutory standard of ‘exceptional and extremely unusual hardship’ to a qualifying relative—a showing necessary to warrant cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1)(D). Cruz-Lopez appealed the IJ’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and also moved for termination of the proceedings on the basis that she was served with an allegedly defective Notice to Appear.

“The BIA dismissed the appeal and denied the motion to terminate. Before this court, Cruz-Lopez challenges only the denial of her application for cancellation of removal. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY the petition for review.

“Cruz-Lopez is a citizen of Mexico who unlawfully entered the United States in 1999. She has one child, Eduardo, who is a United States citizen. At the time of the hearing before the IJ in August 2020, Eduardo was 19 years old and worked part-time as a line cook. Eduardo and CruzLopez live with Cruz-Lopez’s sister, as well as the sister’s husband and son. Cruz-Lopez believes that Eduardo would not move with her if she is removed to Mexico.

“During the hearing before the IJ, Cruz-Lopez presented documentary and testimonial evidence in support of her contention that Eduardo will suffer emotional and economic hardship if she is removed. The IJ ultimately found that the alleged hardship did not rise to the level of being exceptional and extremely unusual. Cruz-Lopez timely appealed to the BIA, which agreed with the IJ that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the hardship standard. This timely petition for review followed.

“We have not yet decided exactly what level of deference we should give to the BIA’s conclusions on this issue. But we need not resolve that question here because, under any level of deference, Cruz-Lopez cannot establish that Eduardo will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.

“The primary issue before us is whether the IJ and the BIA properly concluded that Cruz-Lopez failed to establish that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her child, Eduardo. We hold that the IJ and the BIA did not err in so ruling.

No-Fee PPO Service Bills Pass Senate Unanimously

This week, I was pleased that Senate Bills 611 and 612 passed the Senate unanimously. Sponsored by myself and Senator Ruth Johnson, these bills will make a big difference for victims of stalking and domestic violence who are seeking a Personal Protection Order. These bills now await hearings and a vote in the House. If enacted, Michigan would join 43 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories that already require PPO services to be provided free of charge.

Currently, the cost to serve a PPO can include a service fee plus mileage traveled, which can easily cost almost $100 — an amount that could be especially tough for someone fleeing domestic violence to afford. This legislation would not only make it less financially burdensome for victims but also safer by ensuring the PPO is served by a member of law enforcement rather than a friend or family member of the victim, which is allowed under current law. When someone has gathered the courage to share what has happened to them and secure a PPO, our state should not put up financial barriers to their safety.

Senate Acts to Deliver Relief for Michiganders Facing UIA Benefit Recovery

During the chaos of the pandemic, thousands of Michiganders turned to their government for help, tapping into the unemployment system to put food on the table, pay their bills, and ensure their families could weather a once-in-a-lifetime global health crisis. Since then, the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has been attempting to claw back overpayments it mistakenly made to these same individuals — causing stress for many across the state at an already financially tough time.

Let’s be clear: these families did nothing wrong. That’s why, earlier this week, alongside every single Senator, both Democratic and Republican, I voted to pass legislation that would provide a clean slate for these folks by waiving any overpayments the UIA is currently attempting to collect from this pandemic-era timeframe. Senate Bill 700 now heads to the Michigan House, where I’m hopeful they will act quickly, so we can deliver relief to those who need it most.

Expanding Opportunity, Lowering Costs, & Protecting Michigan: Senate Democrats Reflect on Progress From 2025

As we approach the end of 2025 and wrap up our legislative work for the year, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we’ve delivered for the people of Michigan. Together, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I:

Saved Medicaid in Michigan, protecting access to accessible, affordable health care;

Expanded the widely successful Rx Kids program to improve maternal and infant health outcomes;

Delivered another bipartisan budget that continues the universal free school meals program, implements a long-term road solution, and lowers costs for seniors and families;

Advanced commonsense gun safety policies to keep our communities safe;

Fought back against federal chaos and safeguarded our state from the worst effects of Trump’s disastrous budget plan;

Strengthened protections and benefits for Michigan veterans and their families;

Championed legislation to improve government accountability, tackle racial and ethnic maternal health disparities, lower prescription drug costs, expand transparency in the state budget process, and so much more.

I’m proud of the work we’ve accomplished this year, despite the many obstacles and unprecedented setbacks we faced at both the state and federal levels of government. While we’ll be working in Lansing until the end of the month, I’m already planning ahead for 2026 and looking forward to another productive year advocating for our communities and our state. I also encourage you to stay informed about the legislation moving through the Senate in the coming weeks. Feel free to track the legislation we’re working on here.

Fighting Food Insecurity This Holiday Season and Beyond

Everyone deserves access to quality, nutritious food, full stop — but this year, the demand for food assistance is higher than ever as grocery costs soar and federal Republicans have disrupted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and restricted eligibility. Approximately 1.5 million Michiganders face food insecurity, including over 402,000 children.

My Senate Democratic colleagues and I have worked hard to ensure that every Michigan family has access to food not only during the holidays, but year-round. From proposing $71 million in relief funding to support food banks and continue SNAP benefits during the federal shutdown to delivering another year of free school meals for every Michigan student, we’ve made significant progress in combating food insecurity here in our state. Learn more about our efforts to tackle food insecurity here, and explore food assistance resources below.

It’s important for me to see firsthand the great work community organizations are doing to meet the needs of residents.

I joined residents and lawmakers at a press conference hosted by the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments on December 1 to advocate for the shutdown of US Ecology Detroit South due to environmental harm and harm to residents. Neighbors discussed the negative impact the facility has on their bodies and home lives, citing a constant smell and taste of chemicals. The lawmakers who spoke at the press conference included Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-7) and Rep. Donavan McKinny (D-11), both of whom emphasized the right to breathe clean air and quality of life. Rev. Sharon Buttry, community leader of the DHCAHE, called on the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (BSEED) to shut down the hazardous waste treatment plant and not renew its permit. Earlier this year, I submitted public comment to EGLE expressing my strong concern about the facility’s proposed renewal permit and the related odor and air quality violations.

Standing up for Communities

This week, I, along with several other Michigan elected officials, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) urging the immediate release of Ernesto Cuevas Enciso on bond pending his upcoming immigration hearing. Ernesto is the husband of a United States citizen and the father of a one-year-old child. He is a former DACA recipient with legal work authorization and a pending application for legal permanent residency. We are advocating for his release home to his family, not held at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin. Here is a link to the letter.

We also joined a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field directors in Michigan and Texas, urging them to release four Western International High School students and their families: Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and her father, Gleiner Jose Sosa Mujica; Antony Janier Peña Sosa and his mother, Maryeli Antonieta Sosa Marquina; Mor Ba; and Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez and his mother, Evelin Josefina Perez. These young people and their parents arrived in the United States from Venezuela or Senegal, and all have pending asylum cases. The students are all following the immigration process and are not considered a risk to public safety. Here is a link to the letter.

In a letter sent last week, several Michigan legislators and I called on ICE to address the concerning living conditions for people held in custody in its facilities. We would like to ensure that Alee Vang and others receive the proper required medication and are asking ICE to reduce overcrowding, implement emergency improvements to sanitation and nutrition, ensure adequate on-site medical staffing, and increase oversight and transparency.

“The Trump admin says anyone who pays $1 million will be deemed to have ‘exceptional business ability’ and become eligible for an employment-based immigrant visa,” he wrote. “But there's nothing stopping someone from just getting a loan or using parents' money.”

“Of course, nothing exemplifies the Trump ethos more than ‘every rich person is exceptional at business,’” he added, “but that doesn't change the fact that people who are getting this visa will not necessarily meet the legal requirements, and could risk deportation under a future admin.”

Following that tragic attack, we have been deeply pained to see how our government has villainized and punished entire groups of people — Afghans, Somalis, refugees, asylum seekers, and all immigrants. The president has unleashed vile, racist attacks on Somalis, “demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better,” as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said.

We’ve seen the administration disparage people from dozens of majority non-white countries as “killers” and “leeches,” vowing to expand their racist travel ban.

We’ve seen people arriving for their citizenship ceremonies pulled out of line and told to go home simply because they came from a country that the president deems to be “of concern.”

We’ve seen the administration halt all asylum cases and implement sweeping new restrictions on immigration from “Third World Countries.” This comes after the administration had already stopped all refugee admissions, with the notable exception of white South Africans.

Sadly, dehumanizing rhetoric and scapegoating is nothing new for this administration. We must not allow this kind of racism and hatred from our government to become normalized or accepted.

Insulting and crass language denies the inherent worth and dignity of all people and has been deployed to justify wanton violence and cruelty both at home and abroad.

We’ve seen the Department of Homeland Security post memes rooted in white nationalism to glorify the terrorizing of our neighbors.

We’ve seen the Secretary of Defense evoke a children’s cartoon to flippantly celebrate the murder of people abroad.

As Phil Klay writes in the New York Times, this violence and cruelty is “wounding” our “national soul.”

“The president inhabits a position of moral leadership,” Klay wrote. “When the president and his officials sell their policies, they’re selling a version of what it means to be an American.”

We must continue to defend a different version of our national values held by a strong majority of Americans – one defined by compassion, respect, and solidarity, not cruelty, racism, and xenophobia.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also sued the Department of Homeland Security in October over the $100,000 H-1B visa fee, alleging it exceeded Congress’ authority and illegally bypassed the Immigration and Nationality Act.","A coalition of 20 states sued the Trump administration Friday over its imposition of a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions.

In their 49th lawsuit against the administration this year, the states’ attorneys general, all Democrats, allege the Department of Homeland Security’s new surcharge on temporary worker visas is illegal and exacerbates a nationwide shortage of doctors, nurses, teachers, researchers and other skilled professionals.

“President Trump’s $100,000 fee isn’t just misguided,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference in San Francisco, where he announced the new lawsuit. “It is illegal, and it threatens to worsen already severe shortages across California.”

At issue is the proclamation President Donald Trump signed Sept. 19 ordering the DHS to implement the new fee for any H-1B application filed after Sept. 21. At the time, Trump said the nonimmigrant visa program had “been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.”

The H-1B visa program was created by the Immigration Act of 1990, which allowed U.S. employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for jobs in specialty occupations. Nearly 400,000 H-1B applications were approved in fiscal year 2024, most of them renewals, according to the Pew Research Center. As of 2023, India was the top country of birth for H-1B workers (73%), followed by China (12%), Pew said.

Congress currently caps the number of H-1B visas available at 65,000 a year. H-1B visas usually last for three years and have the potential for a three-year extension, according to the DHS.

Employers who file for the visas had typically paid $900 to $7,500 per visa to cover processing costs, Bonta said. The lawsuit alleges the DHS illegally implemented the $100,000 fee without authorization from Congress.

“This massive fee exceeds the Department of Homeland Security’s authority,” Bonta said. “It ignores Congress’ careful framework for setting visa fees. It undermines the purpose of the H-1B program, and it grants the Secretary of Homeland Security sweeping discretion to apply the fee selectively.”

Bonta said the $100,000 fee had no rational connection to the cost of administering the program and was an unnecessary obstacle intended to shut out the skilled workers American employers need. He said the attorneys general are asking the court to block the fee's implementation.

The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t yet responded to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

Bonta and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell led the lawsuit, which also includes Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

“Our state universities and colleges employ H-1B personnel to support their research and education missions,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement. “They are incapable of absorbing an additional $100,000 for each H-1B they hire, and that is why we are fighting to defend education and ground-breaking research in Colorado.”

A National Education Association analysis in October found more than 500 K-12 public school districts employed at least 2,300 H-1B visa holders nationwide in the 2025 fiscal year. According to the Learning Policy Institute, nearly 412,000 teaching positions in the U.S. were either unfilled or occupied by teachers who were not fully certified in June.

KFF Health News reported that 4.2% of all H-1B petitions were for medicine and health positions in 2024 fiscal year.

The attorneys general H-1B visa lawsuit isn’t the first to challenge the new $100,000 fees in court. In October, a group of plaintiffs in the case Global Nurse Force et al. v. Trump argued the fee exceeds presidential authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also sued the Department of Homeland Security in October over the $100,000 H-1B visa fee, alleging it exceeded Congress’ authority and illegally bypassed the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The Interior Department said in a statement on Friday that the review of retail items would “ensure our gift shops remain neutral spaces that serve all visitors” and “do not promote specific viewpoints.” The department did not respond to questions about what kinds of items it expected parks to remove or what merchandise parks had flagged as unacceptable, if any.

The Trump administration has used the National Park Service to promote its broader effort of telling a more positive version of American history and de-emphasizing Black history, ordering the removal of anything that “inappropriately disparages Americans past or living,” including some materials related to slavery and Native Americans. The National Park Service will also cut Martin Luther King’s Birthday and Juneteenth, two holidays honoring Black history, from its list of free entrance days next year.

Alan Spears, senior director for cultural resources at the National Parks Conservation Association, called the order a “sham review of gift shop materials” and part of “the administration’s deeply troubling pattern of silencing science and hiding history in our parks.”

In a statement, Mr. Spears said that the association opposed the move because “we, like the majority of Americans, support telling the full American story at our parks.” He added, “That means acknowledging hard truths about slavery, climate change, and other topics that challenge us as a nation.”

Mr. Spears said that the Interior Department had not provided any guidance on how to conduct the merchandise review.

President Trump’s approach to public lands has also been a point of contention among some environmentalists, members of Congress and local businesses that offer guided tours of parks.

Starting on Jan. 1, foreign tourists will have to pay a $100 surcharge to visit the country’s most popular national parks. That’s three to five times the typical entry fee for U.S. residents. On Wednesday, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit challenging the National Park Service’s plan to emblazon Mr. Trump’s face on some annual passes to national parks.

Jill Savitt, the chief executive of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, said the civil rights movement and the end of slavery were moments that “make America great” and were essential to telling the full truth of American history.

“When you ban certain kinds of concepts or ideas, you’re not allowing democracy to happen,” she said in an interview. “You’re not allowing that exchange that promotes conversation. You’re saying this is a one-sided conversation.”

It’s unclear how many arrests have been made as a result of the collaboration. But documents obtained by The New York Times show that it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, the college student picked up at Boston Logan Airport on Nov. 20 and deported to Honduras two days later. A former ICE official said 75 percent of instances in that official’s region where names were flagged by the program yielded arrests.

ICE has historically avoided interfering with domestic travel. But the partnership between airport security and the immigration agency, which began quietly in March, is the latest way the Trump administration is increasing cooperation and information sharing between federal agencies in service of the president’s goal of carrying out the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.

“The message to those in the country illegally is clear: The only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.

Airline passengers have long been subject to some federal scrutiny. Airlines typically provide passenger information to T.S.A. after a flight is reserved. That information is compared against national security databases, including the Terrorist Screening Dataset, which includes the names of individuals on a watch list of known or suspected terrorists.

But the T.S.A. previously did not get involved in domestic criminal or immigration matters, said one former agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue freely. Among the concerns, the former official said, has been that enforcement activities at airports could distract from airport security and contribute to longer passenger wait times.

“If you have more officers conducting arrests at airports, it puts more strain on the system, delays and complications may annoy and frighten some travelers, and those who are unsure about their status will move away from air travel,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a senior ICE official during the Biden administration. “It will continue to reduce the space where people feel safe going about their business.”

The push to ramp up enforcement is pervasive inside the Department of Homeland Security, which houses both ICE and the T.S.A. Earlier this year, Stephen Miller, a top White House official, floated a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests a day and met with top ICE officials about how to increase deportations.

Some former ICE officials said the program would be a huge help to an agency struggling to meet the numbers of deportations sought by the Trump administration.

“The administration has turned routine travel into a force multiplier for removals, potentially identifying thousands who thought they could evade the law simply by boarding a plane,” said Scott Mechkowski, the former deputy head of the ICE office in New York City. “This isn’t about fear; it’s about restoring order and ensuring every American knows their government enforces its laws without apology.”

The airport has an added benefit to authorities of a location where potential targets have been scanned for weapons. And, as in the case of Ms. López, people flagged as part of the program have been able to be apprehended and deported very quickly.

Ms. López, 19, had a previous deportation order. In 2018, according to internal records, her case had been referred to ICE for potential arrest. Despite that, she said she did not know about the order and was able to continue to live in the country without issues. Most recently, she was attending Babson College, where she was studying business as a freshman.

Things changed on Nov. 20, when Ms. López arrived at the Boston Logan Airport on her way to Texas. She went through security with her Honduran passport without incident, she said, and arrived at her gate early enough to grab a cup of coffee.

When it was time to board, however, her boarding pass didn’t work.

The second time it was scanned, she noticed an X on the computer screen in front of the agent, who told her to go to customer service to figure out what was happening, she said.

“Oh, you’re Any,” one of the federal agents waiting for her said, according to Ms. López. Internal records show she was initially detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents.

“He was like, well, you’re going to come with us. You’re going to be filling a bunch of paperwork,” she recalled. “I was like, well, I have to be boarding the plane because I have to leave right now. And he was like, well, I don’t think you’re even going to be on that flight.”

Activists blasted the airport deportation program as one intended to frighten immigrants.

“This is another attempt to terrorize and punish communities and will make people terrified to ever leave their homes for fear of being unjustly detained and disappeared out of the country before they have a chance to contest the detention,” said Robyn Barnard, senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, an immigrant advocacy organization.

Documents obtained by The New York Times show Ms. López’s arrest involved an ICE office in California that plays a key role in the airport program. The office, called the Pacific Enforcement Response Center, sends tips to immigration officers across the country and requests to local jails to hold immigrants. Documents show the office flagged Ms. López’s flight information to ICE officers in Boston.

The document details how this is part of a collaboration “with Transportation Security Administration to send actionable leads to the field regarding aliens with a final order of removal that appear to have an impending flight scheduled.”

A former senior ICE official with knowledge of the airport program said the California office often sent several tips a day on potential arrestees at airports in the region the official worked in. The former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal law enforcement matters, said ICE officers received the passenger’s flight number and departure time, as well as a photo of the target — sometimes just hours before the plane took off.

The program is particularly effective because it allows ICE to quickly deport those who are arrested, the former official said.

The arrest of Ms. López is not the only one from the program that has led to media attention.

In late October, Marta Brizeyda Renderos Leiva, a woman from El Salvador, was arrested at the airport in Salt Lake City. Ms. Leiva also had a final deportation order. Video of the arrest shows Ms. Leiva yelling as officers pulled her out of the airport.

Internal records obtained by The Times show that Ms. Leiva’s flight information had been tipped off to local officers by the California office as well.

The Trump administration has tried to leverage other databases to track down immigrants it wants to detain or deport, including the I.R.S., which earlier this year agreed to hand over the addresses of migrants to ICE. A federal court blocked the effort in November.

Ms. López’s case drew publicity in part because she had no criminal record. She had been planning to go home and spend Thanksgiving with her family, including going to church and eating Thanksgiving dinner together. It was a surprise trip.

“I was thinking, OK, this is what I’m going to do with them,” she recalled about the plans she had to spend time with her relatives. “This day I’m going to do this. This day I’m going to be with, like, friends, family and stuff like that. That was the only thing that was going through my mind.”

Now, in Honduras, she is trying to figure out a way to transfer colleges. She misses going to church with her family, to a Texas grocery chain and her mother’s cooking, she said.

But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took special aim at New York at a news conference on Friday. He called the state “the worst offender” for issuing commercial driver’s licenses to foreign nationals without sufficient proof of their long-term work authorization. He also threatened to pull $73 million in federal highway funding unless officials paused issuing all non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and learner’s permit and voided the active licenses of any immigrants found to be driving without legal work permits. The state was given 30 days to respond to the administration’s demands.

Derek D. Barrs, the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, added that if New York failed to act within 30 days, the state could also lose its certification to issue any commercial driver’s licenses.

New York’s commercial driver’s license standards, he charged, represented “a systematically grossly unacceptable deviation from federal safety regulations.”

“When improper licenses are issued, safety is compromised,” he added.

In a statement, Walter McClure, a spokesman for New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles, accused federal transportation officials of “lying about New York State.”

“Here is the truth: Commercial drivers licenses are regulated by the federal government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules,” he said.

“This is just another stunt from Secretary Duffy, and it does nothing to keep our roads safer,” he added.

Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrs have based their criticism of New York on a federal audit of 200 non-domiciled commercial licenses. They said more than half of those license-holders no longer had proper authorization to work in the United States and cited examples in which they said New York had issued credentials to foreigners who didn’t have proper work authorization at the time of their application.

Using that evidence, they questioned whether New York had verified the immigration status of the approximately 32,000 people holding active non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses holders from the state. They also pointed out that the state regularly issued noncitizen commercial driver’s licenses that were valid for eight years, even if applicants did not have work visas that lasted that long.

“They’re not verifying the legal status of that individual,” Mr. Duffy said, arguing that New York was not routinely checking applicants’ passports or visas to verify their continued work eligibility.

Mr. McClure, the New York D.M.V. spokesman, countered that every commercial driver’s license was “subject to verification of an applicant’s lawful status through federally issued documents reviewed in accordance with federal regulations.”

The Trump administration has been pursuing a variety of initiatives to prevent certain immigrants from procuring commercial driver’s licenses. Earlier this year, Mr. Duffy’s department added a nationwide requirement that truckers meet new English-language proficiency standards. Earlier this month, his department revoked the accreditation of thousands of training centers where he said drivers improperly received their licenses.

The centerpiece of the effort, however, has been the department’s effort to pressure certain states to revoke licenses for noncitizen drivers already on the road, largely by threatening to withhold critical highway funds. The urgency around the effort increased after an August crash in Florida, in which an immigrant holding a California-issued commercial driver’s license and accused of being in the country without authorization killed three people after making an illegal U-turn.

Mr. Duffy has been criticized for focusing his efforts on states led by Democratic governors. But he argued on Friday that the threats to California and New York were just about numbers. Together, the two states issue over half of the country’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses, he said.

“You don’t just drive in New York if you get a New York commercial driver’s license. You drive around the country,” Mr. Duffy said. “These unqualified drivers operate in every single state, so everybody’s at risk,” he added.

The request was accompanied by a separate request to pause the inquiry from beginning on Monday morning to let the appeals court work.

The Justice Department’s filings were merely the latest flashpoint between the administration and the courts — especially over the contentious subject of President Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

The main filing had harsh words for Judge Boasberg’s pending contempt proceeding, calling it “an idiosyncratic and misguided inquiry” that “portends a circus.” It was also remarkably antagonistic to the judge himself, making the highly unusual request that the case be stripped from him altogether because he had “developed too strong a bias to preside over this matter impartially.”

Judge Boasberg fired back within hours in his own forceful ruling, saying that the proceeding should go on.

“This inquiry is not some academic exercise,” he wrote. “Approximately 137 men were spirited out of this country without a hearing and placed in a high-security prison in El Salvador, where many suffered abuse and possible torture, despite this court’s order that they should not be disembarked.”

The Justice Department’s request to the appeals court was not the first time it had sought to involve appellate judges in derailing Judge Boasberg’s contempt investigation.

In April, department lawyers persuaded a three-judge panel of the court to put off the inquiry as it considered the investigation’s viability. But in November, after months of deliberation, the full appeals court permitted Judge Boasberg to move forward.

He wasted no time in ordering testimony from Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer who had informed administration officials about his order on March 15 to stop the flights of immigrants from going to El Salvador and to turn around any planes that were already in the air.

Judge Boasberg said he also wanted to hear from Erez Reuveni, one of Mr. Ensign’s former colleagues who filed an explosive whistle-blower complaint about the case after he was fired by the department in a related proceeding. In his complaint, Mr. Reuveni accused Emil Bove III, who was then in a senior role at the Justice Department, of telling his subordinates in profane language that they might need to consider ignoring court orders demanding that the deportation flights be halted.

Those flights were part of an early effort by the White House to send scores of Venezuelan men accused of being members of the violent street gang Tren de Aragua to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the expansive authority of a wartime law passed more than two centuries ago. The law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, gives the president sweeping powers to detain and deport members of a hostile foreign nation in a time of war or during an invasion of the country.

The question of whether Mr. Trump used the act properly to expel the Venezuelans is now being considered by a different court in Texas and is likely to ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department’s filing on Friday concerned the narrower question of whether Judge Boasberg acted properly when he ordered Mr. Ensign and Mr. Reuveni to take the stand in Federal District Court in Washington on Monday and Tuesday.

Lawyers for the department have said that their testimony was not needed because both men have “no personal knowledge” about how the decision was made to send the deportation flights to El Salvador.

Moreover, the lawyers said, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has already acknowledged in a sworn statement to Judge Boasberg that she alone made that decision, relying on advice from top Justice Department officials, including Mr. Bove and Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Bove and Mr. Blanche also filed sworn statements to the judge, but lawyers for the Venezuelan men derided them as being “anemic” and said they “raise more questions than they answer.”

From the start of the dispute, the administration has claimed that it never violated Judge Boasberg’s order, arguing that his oral instructions to turn the planes around midair were not reflected in a subsequent written decision.

“While the judge had made some oral statements at an earlier hearing that suggested he wanted the government to ‘turn planes around,’ those statements were inconsistent, tentative and ultimately superseded by a written order that purported to memorialize the decree but said nothing about returning anyone from abroad,” the Justice Department wrote in its filing to the appeals court.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Venezuelan men, said in a court filing late Thursday night that many questions remained unanswered and that Judge Boasberg had the full authority to demand information from the administration.

The A.C.L.U. lawyers said, for instance, that they wanted to know more about Mr. Bove’s statements suggesting that court orders could be ignored, and about the reaction from administration officials after Mr. Ensign told them about the order that Judge Boasberg ultimately handed down.

In its filing, the administration somewhat nervously expressed concern that having to answer some questions in front of Judge Boasberg would only lead to having to answer more questions.

“The forthcoming hearing has every appearance of an endless fishing expedition,” the Justice Department wrote, “aimed at an ever-widening list of witnesses and prolonged testimony.”

It was still not entirely clear why Admiral Holsey was departing a year into what is typically a three-year job and in the midst of the biggest operation in his 37-year career.

He offered no explanation on Friday at a sun-dappled ceremony flanked by palm trees at his headquarters, near Miami. Admiral Holsey, known as Bull, made no reference to the controversy over the boat strikes in brief remarks, instead urging members of his command to press for a “secure, free and prosperous Western Hemisphere.”

But one current and one former U.S. official, as well as a congressional official, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Admiral Holsey had raised concerns early in the mission about the attacks on the alleged drug boats, which started in September.

At the time, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had expressed frustration that the admiral was not pursuing suspected drug traffickers quickly and aggressively enough. The admiral’s concerns caused him to fall further out of favor with the defense secretary, the officials said. In the end, Mr. Hegseth pushed out Admiral Holsey, the officials said.

While Admiral Holsey has been the highest-ranking military officer overseeing the boat strikes, the decision to carry them out has been driven by the White House and Mr. Hegseth. The strikes themselves have been conducted by the Joint Special Operations Command, with the admiral largely cut out of the decision-making, congressional and defense officials said.

In October, the Southern Command announced it was delegating most of the day-to-day responsibilities of the counterdrug mission to a new task force. Later named Southern Spear, it was led by Lt. Gen. Calvert L. Worth Jr., a Marine Corps general based in Camp Lejeune, N.C.

In the past two weeks, Admiral Holsey’s final days in command have been overshadowed by congressional scrutiny into a follow-on strike that killed two initial survivors of President Trump’s first boat attack on Sept. 2. That additional strike was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who was the head of the Joint Special Operations Command at the time.

On Wednesday, the United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a dramatic escalation of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the country’s leader.

Admiral Holsey briefed top lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees this week in a virtual classified session, but the legislators said the admiral left unanswered many questions about the strikes and his early retirement.

Lt. Gen. Evan L. Pettus, an Air Force fighter pilot and Admiral Holsey’s deputy, will take over as acting commander until Mr. Trump nominates a permanent successor.

Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who presided over the admiral’s retirement ceremony and has been deeply involved in the boat strikes, also made no mention of that campaign or Admiral Holsey’s unusual departure. He praised the admiral on Friday as “a quiet professional.”

Mr. Hegseth offered no comments on Friday about Admiral Holsey’s retirement. Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, referred to Mr. Hegseth’s statement on social media from October, when Admiral Holsey announced his early retirement. Mr. Hegseth’s post made no mention of any friction with his four-star commander.

But other current and former officials at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill said Mr. Hegseth’s praise in October masked real policy tensions concerning Venezuela that the admiral and his civilian boss were seeking to paper over.

“Military officers spend their entire careers earning a role as a four-star combat commander,” said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and the former head of the Southern Command. “To simply depart one year into a three-year assignment without explanation of any kind is beyond unusual. I cannot think of a similar case across my four decades in uniform.”

Since early September, U.S. Special Operations forces have struck at least 22 boats off the coast of Venezuela and in the Eastern Pacific that the White House said were transporting drugs, killing 87 people. American officials have privately made clear that the main goal was to drive Mr. Maduro from power.

A range of specialists in the laws governing the use of force have disputed the Trump administration’s claim that it can lawfully kill people suspected of drug trafficking like enemy troops instead of arresting them for prosecution. As a matter of domestic law, Congress has not authorized any armed conflict.

As a matter of international law, for a nonstate group to qualify as a belligerent in an armed conflict — meaning its members can be targeted for killing based on their status alone, not because of anything they specifically do — it must be an “organized armed group,” with a centralized command structure, and engaging in hostilities.

Admiral Holsey, who is Black, becomes the latest in a line of at least two dozen military leaders, many of them people of color and women, who have left their jobs this year. Most have been fired by Mr. Hegseth or pushed out.

Mr. Hegseth fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who is Black; the first woman to command the Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; and the U.S. military’s representative to the NATO military committee, Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield. Mr. Hegseth also pushed out Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Admiral Holsey’s abrupt end to leading one of the military’s highly coveted regional war-fighting commands comes after a Navy career that started with his commissioning through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps, or NROTC, at Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1988.

The admiral, a native of Fort Valley, Ga., worked his way up from commanding helicopter squadrons to leading one of the Navy’s prestigious aircraft carrier strike groups. He served first as the Southern Command’s military deputy before taking command in November 2024.

“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the suit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”

The White House has maintained that the grounds are exempt from the National Historical Preservation Act, but lawyers for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, an organization chartered by Congress to preserve America’s historic buildings, argue Mr. Trump is violating other sections of U.S. Code.

The suit points to a section of federal law that states, “A building or structure shall not be erected on any reservation, park or public grounds of the federal government in the District of Columbia without express authority of Congress.”

The suit argues that the way Mr. Trump has proceeded with the project has also violated the National Capital Planning Act, law governing the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

The suit argues that Mr. Trump was required to submit plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before demolishing the East Wing. And it says he must follow the legal process before continuing any work on the property.

Mr. Trump surprised many in October when he abruptly tore down one side of the White House, demolishing the entire East Wing to make way for his 90,000-square-foot ballroom. Mr. Trump has told people working on the project that he does not need to follow permitting, zoning or code requirements because the structure is on White House grounds and he has the final say.

A White House spokesman said in a statement that Mr. Trump had authority to make changes on the property as he saw fit.

“President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate and beautify the White House — just like all of his predecessors did,” said the spokesman, Davis Ingle.

The suit argues that Mr. Trump’s conduct around the ballroom project is out of step with tradition and even actions he took during his first term, when his administration sought approval for new fencing and a new tennis pavilion.

The National Trust took several steps before filing the suit, including writing a letter to the administration that urged a pause in the demolition of the East Wing until plans for the proposed ballroom went through a public review process.

But the National Trust received no response to its letter.

“It wasn’t step one,” Carol Quillen, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said of the decision to sue. “It was our last option. Construction appears to be ongoing. What is happening now at the White House could foreclose a meaningful review. It could determine in advance of the review what the project footprint is, making the review moot. So we felt we had no choice.”

Democrats provided no context for the images they released, including any email messages that might have accompanied them. They also redacted faces of women in some of the photos, which they said was an effort to protect the identities of any potential victims of Mr. Epstein.

But Democrats argued that it was appropriate to release the photographs ahead of a deadline next Friday for the Justice Department to make public, with significant exceptions, its investigative files about the Epstein case.

Mr. Epstein died by suicide in a federal prison in 2019 while in custody on sex-trafficking charges. Many of the wealthy and famous men who were once in his orbit have faced questions for years about what they knew about his lurid lifestyle and the accusations that he was trafficking girls as young as 14 for sex.

“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world,” said Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, in a statement. “We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, now.”

A law passed by Congress last month requires the Justice Department to release its files on Mr. Epstein by Dec. 19, though the measure includes several exceptions that could delay or block full disclosure.

The photographs released on Friday were part of a separate trove of information that Mr. Epstein’s estate has turned over to Congress in recent months in response to a subpoena from the oversight panel.

Republicans on the Oversight Committee accused Democrats of selectively releasing the images to fuel a misleading and debunked narrative about Mr. Epstein’s ties to the president. A spokeswoman for the Republicans, who insisted on anonymity because she did not want her name associated with Mr. Epstein, said that nothing in the documents received by the panel showed any wrongdoing.

Most of the images released by Democrats document ties that had already been known. As well as Mr. Clinton and Mr. Trump, they show Mr. Epstein with Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard University economist and former Treasury secretary; the film director Woody Allen; the tech billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates; and Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing media personality who has said that he videotaped interviews in Mr. Epstein’s mansion in 2019.

Mr. Bannon and representatives for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gates, Mr. Summers and Mr. Allen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The selection of images appeared intended at least in part to insulate Democrats from Republicans’ criticism that they have been overly focused on Mr. Epstein’s links to Mr. Trump while ignoring his ties to figures on the left.

The series of photos does include three images of Mr. Trump. One, which was previously public, shows Mr. Epstein and Mr. Trump together at a Victoria’s Secret party in New York City in 1997. Two others depict Mr. Trump with unidentified women, and their locations are not clear. One of them, in black-and-white, shows Mr. Trump standing with six unidentified women wearing plastic leis.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, accused House Democrats of “random redactions” to perpetuate a “Democrat hoax.” Mr. Trump used that phrase earlier this year as he dismissed calls to release the Epstein files, before Congress forced the issue with a law.

Ms. Jackson, pointing to ties between Mr. Epstein and Democratic figures, asserted that “the Trump administration has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”

Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he and Mr. Epstein were once friendly, and both men lived in Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Fla. But he has repeatedly and emphatically denied any knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation, and the two men had a falling-out sometime in the mid-2000s.

In emails previously released by the Oversight Committee, Mr. Epstein cast himself as an insider with potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump. After his death, Mr. Epstein was at the center of theories that he might be running a blackmail operation, but the Justice Department concluded in July that there was no credible evidence that “Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”

Some of the other photos show sex toys. One depicts a satirical “Trump condom” that also appears to be part of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection.

In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said he had spoken by phone with Mr. Anutin, and Cambodia’s leader, Hun Manet. The discussion with Mr. Hun Manet was not immediately confirmed by Cambodian officials, although the government’s spokesman had said they were hoping to talk with him.

Mr. Trump said the two leaders had agreed to return to the terms of the peace agreement that they signed in October. Five days of resumed fighting this week has killed at least 20 people and displaced more than half a million.

“Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America,” Mr. Trump wrote. “It is my Honor to work with Anutin and Hun in resolving what could have evolved into a major War between two otherwise wonderful and prosperous Countries!”

It was unclear if Mr. Trump’s intervention this time would lead to a genuine breakthrough. The decades-long territorial dispute stems from a map drawn by colonial France. Just over six weeks ago, Mr. Anutin and Mr. Hun Manet signed the peace deal in Malaysia, with Mr. Trump in attendance. But the pact was always tenuous, and it unraveled quickly.

Tensions boiled over on Monday, when Thailand launched airstrikes against Cambodia in retaliation for what it said was the killing of one Thai soldier and the wounding of others. Mr. Trump said it was a “roadside bomb” that killed and wounded the Thai troops, describing it as “an accident, but Thailand nevertheless retaliated very strongly.”

For days now, Thailand has carried out air attacks in Cambodia, which has responded with rocket fire.

Mr. Anutin said he told Mr. Trump that Thailand had not violated the peace deal, saying it was necessary for “Thailand to retaliate to protect our nation and our people.” He added, “This is why I had to explain to the president or he might misunderstand and see us as the aggressor.”

Mr. Anutin said he told Mr. Trump to tell Cambodia, “Thailand never wants anything from them, but they have to stop everything first.”

Cambodia has rejected Thailand’s assertions and has said it is collecting evidence against Thailand with the aim of filing a complaint with the International Criminal Court.

Before Mr. Trump’s call, the Thai and Cambodian armies continued their attacks.

Dek Koma, 25, who lives about 10 miles from the site of a clash in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province, described intense gunfire on Thursday night and shelling that continued well into the night. “The explosions were very strong,” he said. “Before, they didn’t shell much at night.”

Thailand and Cambodia have exchanged fire in years past over their nearly 500-mile-long boundary, large parts of which are undefined. But the scope of the recent fighting has expanded beyond previous clashes.

“I don’t think it would be realistic to hope for breakthroughs at this stage,” said Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at Thailand Future, a Bangkok-based research institution. The conflict is at a “level that we have not seen in history.”

The number of people displaced in Cambodia and Thailand has now exceeded those displaced in fighting over the summer.

Li Nam, 38, said the Cambodian authorities ordered him to leave his house in Oddar Meanchey province near the border on Thursday night. He had stayed when the fighting broke out on Monday to look after his wooden house, seven pigs, dozens of chickens and grocery store.

On Thursday night, after his village chief told him that his area was a “red zone,” he slept in the fields.

On Thursday night, Mr. Anutin — who only assumed office in September, after agreeing to early elections — dissolved Parliament sooner than expected, setting the stage for elections in January or February.

The previous prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was suspended in July after a leaked call with the Cambodian strongman Hun Sen, father of the current prime minister, over the border dispute in which she appeared to be overly deferential.

The political horse-trading after her ouster all but ensured an election in the first half of 2026, instead of 2027 as originally scheduled.

Now, with new elections imminent, Mr. Anutin, as a caretaker prime minister, is expected to try to capitalize on the nationalist mood around the country to boost his reputation and the standing of his party, Bhumjaithai, which is close to Thailand’s powerful military.

Mr. Trump, who continues to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him, has embarked on a wide-ranging campaign to settle scores related to his effort to overturn the race. On the first day of his second term, he issued a sweeping grant of clemency to nearly all 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

But the president has no power to pardon state crimes. Mr. Trump could not, for example, pardon himself for the 34 felony convictions handed down in a New York trial last year. Because Ms. Peters is in prison for a state offense, Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday was primarily symbolic.

“Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers for state crimes in a state court,” Jena Griswold, the Colorado secretary of state, said in a statement on Thursday. “Trump has no constitutional authority to pardon her. His assault is not just on our democracy, but on states’ rights and the American constitution.”

While Mr. Trump’s declaration had little practical effect for Ms. Peters, it was a reminder that the president has used his expansive legal powers to reward and protect his allies, even as his Justice Department has shattered traditional norms of independence by following his orders to pursue criminal cases against perceived enemies.

In just the last few weeks, Mr. Trump pardoned Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, apparently believing that he would defect to the Republican Party. He also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who was prosecuted during the first Trump administration for leading a drug-trafficking conspiracy.

In one particularly strange case, Mr. Trump pardoned a real estate developer who had been indicted by his own Justice Department earlier this year.

In many ways, Mr. Trump’s promise to grant clemency to Ms. Peters echoed his announcement last month that he was pardoning his former lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and a wide array of others accused of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, even though none of them had been accused of federal crimes.

Mr. Trump’s social media post on Thursday about Ms. Peters followed an expansive effort by her allies to persuade him that he needed to help her. Led by the lawyer Peter Ticktin, a longtime friend and ally of Mr. Trump’s, Ms. Peters’ supporters have sought to convince the president that she is an important potential witness in an investigation to prove false claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him.

Over the weekend, Mr. Ticktin sent Mr. Trump a nine-page letter asking him to pardon Ms. Peters, while admitting that the “question of whether a president can pardon for state offenses has never been raised in any court.”

In his letter, Mr. Ticktin cast Ms. Peters as the victim of a cabal of enemies that included Dominion Voting Systems, the voting machine company, and the Venezuelan government, which he claimed had sought to use digital vote counting technology to rig American elections.

Mr. Trump’s announcement was not the first time his administration had tried to help Ms. Peters.

In March, the Justice Department intervened in her efforts to ask a federal judge to release her from prison, saying there were “reasonable concerns” about the length of her state sentence. The department said that a review of her case was needed as part of a broader examination of cases “across the nation for abuses of the criminal justice process.”

On Monday, however, a federal judge in Denver turned down her request to be freed, finding that state courts, not federal courts, should determine her fate.

The same day, in what appeared to be another attempt to pressure Colorado state officials, the Justice Department announced that it was opening a civil investigation into the state’s prison system. Days earlier on social media, Mr. Trump had attacked Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat, as a “sleazebag” for failing to release Ms. Peters on his own accord, claiming she had been “unfairly convicted.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/12/multimedia/12trump-news-promo330p-lmgf/12trump-news-promo330p-lmgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:58:44.835930

Magaziner went on to introduce Park, a U.S. Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving in Panama in 1989. Park came to the U.S. at the age of 7 from South Korea. In the 1990s, Park had a drug addiction and was arrested for minor drug offenses, Magazine said.

Park, who battled a crack cocaine addiction, was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping, according to NPR. As a Green Card holder, those charges hurt his chances to become naturalized, the outlet reported.

""Will you join me in thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country?"" Magaziner asked Noem, with a tablet being held next to the congressman’s head that had Park video-called in.

""Sir, I’m grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws and knows that our laws are important and that every one of them needs to be enforced,"" Noem responded.

When asked whether Noem would review Park’s case, the secretary said she ""will absolutely look at his case.""

Throughout the hearing, Democrats chastised Noem and her department’s immigration enforcement efforts, including the secretary’s decision to continue deportation flights to El Salvador despite a court order halting the flights earlier this year. Protestors interrupted her opening remarks, chanting ""Stop ICE raids,"" ""end deportations,"" and ""get ICE off our streets."" Noem, who left the hearing early to attend a FEMA review advisory council meeting that was later canceled, was met with more protestors outside the hearing room.

Noem’s time with the Trump administration has been called into question following a report from MS NOW where a White House official said Noem was on ""very thin ice"" and that she would be replaced as early as January. President Donald Trump on Dec. 10 said that he was ""happy"" with Noem and that she’s ""fantastic.""

""We have a border that's the best border in the history of our country. Why would I be unhappy?"" Trump told reporters during a roundtable with business leaders at the White House.

Noem remained defiant throughout the hearing as Democrats lambasted the secretary as a ""liar"" and Republicans offered her praise for her job.

""America is very happy that, finally, they have a president in the White House that gets up every day to keep them safe,"" Noem said during the hearing.

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, the ranking chairman of the House Homeland Security committee, called on Noem to resign.

When asked by Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Michigan, whether she would resign if she’s not fired, Noem said: ""I will consider your asking me to resign as an endorsement of my work.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/USAT/87720242007-2250628277.jpg?crop=8087,4549,x0,y421&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 18:57:55.328031

One source close to the White House said that ""Tom's putting his head down.
The big picture: For months, Washington's chattering class has been predicting a shakeup in Trump's White House, partly because of the huge turnover in his first administration.","The acrimony is so deep between President Trump's border czar and his homeland security secretary that the two officials barely speak to or meet with each other, insiders tell Axios.

Why it matters: Tensions reached such a fever pitch last week that the White House was swamped with rumors and news stories claiming that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had lost Trump's favor and was on her way out.

Noem's backers blamed the whisper campaign on supporters of her administration rival, border czar Tom Homan.

Homan's partisans deny any involvement.

Reality check: Neither Noem nor Homan are going anywhere, according to administration officials inside and outside the White House. Trump has shown no signs of wanting a change.

""Kristi's doing a great job,"" Trump, unprompted, recently told an adviser who relayed the conversation to Axios.

""Her and Tom don't get along,"" the president chuckled, the source said. ""But they're doing great.""

The adviser said Trump doesn't mind the conflict: ""Trump is like that. He kind of likes people competing against each other. He thinks it makes the product better.""

Zoom in: The exact cause of the tensions between Noem and Homan isn't clear, but sources say the conflict — months in the making — is a personality clash at the very least.

Supporters of both officials accuse the other of contracting irregularities, which each side denies. Noem's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has more than $170 billion from Congress to spend on catching, detaining and deporting what the White House hopes will be millions of unauthorized immigrants.

Noem, a former South Dakota governor, has spent millions of department dollars on a controversial campaign-style ad blitz that some insiders believe promotes her as much as the department's mission.

That rankles career immigration officials, many of whom are loyal to Homan, a 30-year immigration-enforcement vet.

Insiders have personally complained to Trump about Noem's management and the role of her top adviser, Trump campaign veteran Corey Lewandowski, who in effect runs DHS, the sources said.

Meanwhile, Homan's appearances on Fox News have led Noem's supporters to cast him as a self-promoter without portfolio.

Two DHS sources said Homan's media hits aren't coordinated with the department's press office and that he sometimes makes policy proclamations that catch officials off guard, irritating Noem's senior staff.

""Tom expected to have more operational control of day to day, and especially on contracts,"" one agency official said.

""It's disappointing that he chooses to go after Secretary Noem when he is unhappy that he does not have 'The Tom Homan Show' to be a part of.""

Homan also has been dogged by allegations of misconduct and conflicts of interest. An MS NOW report in September rapped him for being under FBI investigation in 2024 for allegedly taking a $50,000 cash payoff in a now-closed bribery probe.

The intrigue: When he began working for the administration, Homan filed his personal financial disclosure form with DHS and worked some days out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) headquarters in D.C.

But by the summer he'd shifted, at least on paper, to be a White House employee, according to public records. A White House official said the move was not related to tensions with Noem and was planned all along.

One source close to the White House said that ""Tom's putting his head down. He's like, 'You know, this isn't worth it. I'm going to go do my job that the president has authorized me to do.' And that's what he's doing.""

The big picture: For months, Washington's chattering class has been predicting a shakeup in Trump's White House, partly because of the huge turnover in his first administration. But Trump advisers say he likes his team of loyalists this time and hasn't expressed interest in firing anyone.

""He's happy with his Cabinet,"" said another Trump adviser who is no fan of Noem. ""Do I wish Kristi was gone? Absolutely. But that ain't happening. At least, not that he'll tell me.""

What they're saying: Despite the personality clash, record deportations and aggressive immigration enforcement proceed apace. And Trump is thrilled, even as his immigration crackdown has angered many Americans and appears to be weighing on his poll numbers.

DHS referred requests for comment to the White House.

""President Trump has assembled the most talented and capable Cabinet in American history, which includes Secretary Noem who is doing a great job implementing the president's agenda and making America safe again,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.

""The president's entire immigration enforcement team — which includes Tom Homan and his critical contributions to the border security effort ... is working in lockstep to implement the agenda President Trump was elected to enact.""",https://images.axios.com/Huciq8hvKCDAgR5P8Ydr9I7M9sM=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/12/10/1765401770806.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:57:32.415305

Charges were brought against illegal aliens with past convictions for violent crimes and DWIs, as well as alleged human smugglers and aliens with prior removals.

Francisco Javier Navarro-Ramirez, a Legal Permanent Resident born in Mexico, was arrested near Tornillo and charged with human smuggling. A criminal complaint alleges Navarro-Ramirez was the driver of a vehicle travelling at high speeds with multiple individuals inside. Navarro-Ramirez allegedly did not yield to U.S. Border Patrol emergency lights and was eventually stopped by a tire deflation device deployed by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper. The complaint alleges that Navarro-Ramirez was quickly apprehended after he attempted to flee on foot, and five illegal aliens were found inside the vehicle.

A Salvadoran national was arrested by USBP agents near Maverick for being illegally present in the U.S. Douglas Alexis Bautista-Arevalo was removed to El Salvador for the second time on Sept. 4 and has been previously convicted for two DWIs. In March, he was convicted for assault causing bodily injury to a family member.

In Austin, Mexican nationals Juan David Barajas-Armas and Noe Mendez-Salazar were each charged with illegal re-entry. Barajas-Armas has two prior removals and has been convicted of three DWIs and obstructing a highway/passageway. Mendez-Salazar has also been removed twice before and has three DWI convictions.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime.

December 11, 2025

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this year’s massive $900 billion military spending bill.

This legislation gives more money to the so-called Department of War than to our Departments of Education, Transportation, and Health and Human Services, combined.

Mr. Speaker, can you ask my Republican colleagues to get serious about helping the American public?

I know you seek to be judged by the content of your character.

It is certainly poor character to be not support our military service members and their families, and this mammoth bill does not do that.

Certainly, it is poor character to block health care coverage for IVF, despite the fact that IVF is critical for helping active-duty personnel grow their families.

Certainly, it is poor character to ban initiatives associated with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, even though these cuts will undermine military readiness.

This bill, this mammoth bill, expands the administration’s power to attack immigrants, including for our Haitian neighbors.

The few good things in this legislation do not outweigh the cruelty and the harm that will undoubtedly come if it is signed into law.

The public does not support this bill, and neither do I, and that is why I am a NO vote.

***

A Mexican man visiting family in Arizona for the holidays was detained and kept in immigration detention for almost three days — despite having proper documents and legal authority to be in the country, two of his family members told Phoenix New Times. He has since been released, the family said, though immigration authorities have not returned the documents that allow him to be in the U.S.

On Tuesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 27-year-old Edwar Omar Mezquita Gonzalez in San Tan Valley after Pinal County Sheriff’s deputies stopped the truck his brother was driving. The brother, whose name New Times is withholding at the family’s request, was not detained and has a green card.

ICE acknowledged an email seeking information about Gonzalez’s arrest, but has not responded substantively.

On Tuesday morning, Gonzalez was riding shotgun in his older brother’s white GMC Sierra truck when they drove by a half-dozen police vehicles lining the side of the road. The pair gawked at the police activity as they passed, according to family members, and Gonzalez pulled out his phone to film as ICE agents and sheriff’s deputies detained a landscaper.

According to two family members — the brother’s wife, who asked to be identified by her nickname, Vale; and Sam Cooley, an extended family member and an immigration activist — a Pinal County Sheriff vehicle then pulled out of the line and stopped the brother’s truck. A sheriff’s deputy told the brother he was pulled over for obscured plates and improper window tint, Vale said. While the deputy spoke to the brother, an ICE agent in another vehicle pulled in right behind them.

The ICE agent asked both men to present their documents. The brother presented his green card while Gonzalez presented a temporary travel visa for Mexican citizens. Vale said the ICE agent then claimed that Gonzalez was working in violation of his visa and detained him, though Vale claimed he was obeying the visa’s terms.

“My husband tried to explain to them, ‘He’s my little brother. He’s only here visiting,’” Vale told New Times. “You guys can’t take him. He has all this documentation.”

‘In a work vehicle’

New Times has viewed Gonzalez’s documentation. In August, he applied for and received a Border Crossing Card, which is issued to Mexican nationals with strong ties to Mexico, indicating they plan to return to their home country. The card allows Mexican nationals to make short visits for temporary pleasure or business to the U.S. border zone — which extends from the border to a little north of Tucson — for up to 30 days if they enter by land or sea.

New Times has viewed a photo of the card issued to Gonzalez, who lives and works in Rocky Point (also known as Puerto Peñasco) in Mexico.

If Border Crossing Card holders wish to stay longer and travel further, they must complete the Form I-94 upon entry into the U.S. Gonzalez did that when he entered the country in September, according to an online portal on the Customs and Border Protection website. The form allows Border Crossing Card holders to travel anywhere in the country and stay for up to six months, which would cap Gonzalez’s stay at the end of March. However, if cardholders seek employment during their stay, they may face revocation of the document, deportation and may even be barred from future U.S. entry.

According to Vale, her husband was off that day and he was running errands with Gonzalez while the latter was in town for an extended holiday stay. They had just grabbed coffee and were in San Tan Valley to drop off a broken paint machine before getting breakfast.

However, immigration attorneys not involved in Gonzalez’s case speculated ICE may have claimed he was working due to the circumstances of his arrest. While the brothers insisted Gonzalez wasn’t working, the ICE agent said he was in a “work area in a work vehicle,” Vale said. The brother’s truck is outfitted with ladders on racks above the trunk. While the brother does use it for construction jobs, Vale said, he also uses it to run errands and pick up his kids.

However, being stopped in what is ostensibly a work truck could have made it difficult for Gonzalez to claim he wasn’t working, according to immigration attorney Salvador Macias. “The hardest part is overcoming the allegation that he wasn’t working, considering he was in the truck,” Macias wrote in a text message. Delia Salvatierra, another immigration attorney, noted that “visitors visas are non-immigrant visas, so you have to show non-immigrant intent.”

Gonzalez’s arrest also appears to be an example of Pinal County’s new effort to coordinate with ICE. The Pinal County Sheriff’s Office has had ICE in its jails since 2008 through a 287(g) agreement and the county attorney’s office was recently granted 287(g) authority to conduct limited enforcement of immigration law under the auspices of ICE. The truck’s allegedly obscured plate and allegedly overly tinted windows — which Vale said she doubts were in the state the sheriff deputy claimed — gave the deputy an opening to stop the truck and cleared the way for ICE to ask for documents.

In a statement to New Times, Pinal County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Samuel Salzwedel said agents from Homeland Security Investigations — a division of ICE – “are frequently in San Tan Valley and available to assist deputies when contacted.”

‘He has no information’

Gonzalez’s brother was allowed to leave. Before he did, he wrote his phone number on Gonzalez’s arm.

Gonzalez was transported to ICE’s Phoenix field office, nearly 50 miles away, where he was held until being released late Thursday night. Gonzalez has been able to call his brother multiple times using a payphone in the field office. New Times has attempted to get in touch with Gonzalez, but Vale said the only person he was able to call was his brother. While he was detained, Vale spoke to him through her husband’s phone.

Cooley said Gonzalez was “miserable” in ICE custody. Vale said he also struggled to get information from guards at the field office about the status of his detention and was told that he just had to wait his turn to talk to an immigration officer. Cooley said Gonazlez was ultimately able to speak to one.

While he was detained, Gonzalez’s family tried to speak with ICE employees at the field office but were not given much information. Family members also reached out to the office of Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton, whose constituent services team assisted in the case, according to his spokesperson. It’s not clear if Stanton’s intervention played a role in Gonzalez’s release.

Now that he has been released, Cooley said Gonzalez is strongly considering self-deporting and returning to Mexico, but he is unable to do so without his documents. In addition to keeping Gonzalez’s Border Crossing Card, Cooley said, ICE also confiscated his Mexican voter registration and driver’s license.

Gonzalez has no children, but he takes care of all of the large, tight-knit family around him, Cooley said. In Rocky Point, Gonzalez cares for both of his parent and his grandmother. He also frequently visits his brother, sister-in-law, nieces and nephews in Mesa and also has family in Phoenix and Colorado. He comes up to the Phoenix area multiple times a year from Mexico to celebrate holidays, birthdays and special events, Cooley said.",https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/12/Edwar-Gonzalez.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 16:59:14.289858

The Mexican immigrant was at the USCIS office with his wife for an interview as part of the green card process.
Now in his early 20s, he recently married a U.S. citizen and sought to adjust his immigration status.
“When people go in for a green card interview, it’s because they’ve complied with everything else and they’re at the end of the line.
Her client married a U.S. citizen and was eligible to apply for a green card.","A British mother holding an infant, a Ukrainian refugee, the wife of a Navy veteran, a German man about to celebrate his first wedding anniversary. These are some of the spouses of U.S. citizens who were recently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at what they thought were going to be routine green card interviews.

There have been several dozen known cases out of San Diego alone, but cases have also been reported in New York City, Cleveland and Utah, according to attorneys and local news reports.

Immigration attorneys told NBC News that this marks an “unprecedented” break in decadeslong practice policy, and that their clients are panicked they could be detained even when they are eligible to become legal permanent residents by law and have no criminal histories.

Jan Joseph Bejar, an immigration attorney in San Diego who recently had a client detained, said if the arrests spread around the country, “It’d be huge. It would be really devastating.”

The detentions are one of the latest tactics in President Donald Trump’s policies targeting legal pathways for immigration and increasing scrutiny of green card applicants.

The Trump administration has said in multiple cases that people were detained because they had fallen out of status by overstaying their visas, but longtime attorneys say this has never been an issue and spouses of U.S. citizens looking to obtain green cards were granted exceptions by Congress. The law says that immediate relatives, such as spouses, of U.S. citizens are eligible for green cards even if they were in unlawful immigration status at the time they filed to become legal permanent residents.

“There was a carve-out that was intended for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, including spouses. This was or is the legal path for them to adjust their status. This is going about doing things ‘the right way,’” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.

She added that because it can take well over a year to go through the entire process, people “could very easily fall out of status right in the process of waiting for that green card through their marriage.”

The British woman was released almost a week later and her green card approved, according to NBC San Diego. The Navy veteran’s wife was released on bond, according to the outlet, and must now pursue her case in immigration court. The status of the German man and the Ukrainian refugee are currently unclear. All four had fallen out of status because of visa overstays but were still eligible to become green card holders, according to their attorneys.

Attorneys said the exact number of people affected would be difficult to quantify, but all said many spouses of U.S. citizens seeking green cards could fall into the category of overstaying their visas. There are currently at least hundreds of thousands of people who are at some stage of the green card application process, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Service data.

Once a green card applicant is detained by ICE, their case goes through the immigration court system, where a prosecutor will argue against the applicant receiving legal status, Bejar said. Because of the yearslong backlog that immigration courts are facing, this will extend valid green card applicants’ cases and come at a cost to taxpayers, he said.

USCIS spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said in a statement to NBC News that apprehensions at its offices “may occur if individuals are identified as having outstanding warrants; being subject to court-issued removal orders; or having committed fraud, crimes, or other violations of immigration law while in the United States.”

“The Trump administration has been abundantly clear: aliens must respect our laws or face the consequences,” he said. “Overstaying a visa is an immigration law violation that can result in deportation.”

ICE said in a statement to NBC San Diego in late November that the agency “is committed to enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that prioritize national security, public safety, and border security.”

“Individuals unlawfully present in the United States, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal in accordance with U.S. immigration law,” its statement said.

Bejar said he had a client married to a U.S. citizen who was detained at a San Diego USCIS office two days before Thanksgiving.

The Mexican immigrant was at the USCIS office with his wife for an interview as part of the green card process. Bejar said the interview had been going well and the officer said he would approve the first part of the couple’s petition. Then ICE agents came and took his client away.

The attorney said his client was brought from Mexico as a young teenager and his parents had overstayed their visa. Now in his early 20s, he recently married a U.S. citizen and sought to adjust his immigration status. As the immediate relative of a U.S. citizen who does not have a criminal record, the man was still eligible for a green card even if he overstayed his visa, according to his attorney.

“When people go in for a green card interview, it’s because they’ve complied with everything else and they’re at the end of the line. In other words, you’re almost there. You’ve gone through the sacrifices of paying for the government fees, for your legal fees,” Bejar said.

Bejar said he and other attorneys have been going through their cases to warn applicants in the San Diego area, but their options are limited.

“While there’s nothing in particular that says ICE can’t detain them during that time, it’s always been viewed as a waste of resources, because they are eligible for the benefit of a green card,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, the senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Why would you waste enforcement resources or detention resources on those individuals?”

“Instead of actually picking up violent criminals, like they say they’re doing, they’re picking up people who are following the rules that have been in place for decades,” she said.

Courtney Koski, a senior attorney with the Costas Law Firm in the Cleveland, Ohio, area, said she and other attorneys in the Cleveland area have noticed a change in USCIS agents where they are “finding officers scrutinizing and nitpicking every aspect of the case, looking for reasons to deny.”

Koski said she recently had a client detained at an interview Nov. 24 as part of the spousal petition process, the step before applying for a green card, even though she was eligible for the benefit and had no criminal history.

The Mexican woman had been in the U.S. for 25 years. Koski said her client had a removal order connected to what she called “a government mistake” where a court scheduled an immigration hearing for the client’s family in July 2004 and then “rescheduled their hearing for April of 2004 without sending my client any type of notice whatsoever.”

“This is the reason why my client has a removal order, because the government made a mistake and did not notify her of her hearing date,” she said. NBC News could not independently verify the circumstances related to the hearing date.

Her client married a U.S. citizen and was eligible to apply for a green card. Koski said she planned to file to reopen her client’s case once the spousal petition was approved since the approval could help strengthen their case.

“Under the previous administration, people who were being detained generally were considered a threat to national security or threat to public safety, so someone with no criminal history would not have been expected to be detained in an interview like this,” she said.

Jeremy Lawer, 33, the woman’s husband, said “the interview was going pretty well, and ICE agents came anyway. We were incredibly shocked.”

“She was understandably nervous. But you know, I was like there’s no reason they’re going to deny us. We’ve been living together. We bought a house together,” he said.

Lawer said he feels he and his wife have been caught in the “political football” under the Trump administration.

The same day that his wife was detained, he got a letter saying the spousal petition was approved.

Koski has filed to reopen the case and, in the meantime, her client has been moved around to multiple detention centers.

“From my perspective, this all feels kind of like a setup,” Lawer said. “Like they had always been intending to arrest her that day.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/240220-office-of-US-Citizenship-and-Immigration-Services-ew-126p-7182a5.jpg",N,,2025-12-12 21:57:25.846126

Holy Land’s employees, who include immigrants from Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, are also concerned about what to do if they are inadvertently detained.","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is disrupting Twin Cities businesses where immigrants buy groceries, get haircuts or find community.

The operation by Immigration & Customs Enforcement has centered on Minnesota’s Somali community, but the fear that it has triggered — of deportation or wrongful detention — has extended to many immigrant communities.

That’s caused staffing challenges and a drop in foot traffic for businesses along Central Avenue in Northeast Minneapolis, which has long been a hub for businesses run by and serving Minnesotans with heritage from South Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

“What’s happening is definitely making people feel unsafe. … They are worried, whether they are documented or not, for themselves and for their families,” said Majdi Wadi, CEO of Holy Land, a large grocer and restaurant offering Middle Eastern and Mediterranean products for almost four decades.

Five blocks south at the Yemeni coffee shop Qahwah House, employee Hassan Al Urduni estimated that business this week was down about 20% compared to last week.

“Obviously we don’t just serve only one nationality here,” Al Urduni said, “but those who really had the place buzzing, who would stay and chat and order coffee after coffee, those were usually immigrants or children of immigrants looking for a taste of the qahwa they used to drink back in their countries or that their mothers would make in their homes in Minnesota,” he said, using the Arabic word for the uniquely thick, sweet, black coffee popular in the Middle East, as well as in East and North Africa.

Other nearby businesses reported similar drops in traffic, including a storefront that helps immigrants send money to relatives overseas, particularly in Latin America, and a barbershop whose owner was grateful for its diverse clientele.

“Thank God, our customers come from all over. We are popular with Black Americans, white Americans, immigrants, all kinds of people,” said Salam Barbershop owner Abdellah El Bal. “So, God willing, things will ease back to normal soon.”

“But one thing which is unusual, is that our Latino friends seem to have completely disappeared from our shop,” El Bal said. “It’s almost like they’ve dropped off the face of the Earth.”

Elsewhere in the city, some businesses, especially in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, have closed down entirely out of fear that they or their employees will be targeted, said state Sen. Doron Clark, DFL-Minneapolis.

Clark’s district includes Northeast Minneapolis and he has been involved in connecting immigrants across the metro area to legal resources as well as members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation, specifically Rep. Ilhan Omar, DFL-5th District, and Sens. Tina Smith, DFL-Minn., and Amy Klobuchar, DFL-Minn.

“My personal cell phone is constantly receiving texts from constituents who want to know what their rights are, what their family’s rights are, how they can help their neighbors,” he said, adding that he is in regular contact with state Rep. Mohamud Noor, DFL-Minneapolis, who represents the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, about how best to help concerned Minnesotans.

Related: How are St. Paul and Minneapolis schools preparing for possible ICE raids?

Clark has fielded calls from many businesses on how to educate employees and was dismayed that owners feel they have to spend time teaching workers about laws that immigration agents should already be following and making clear to those they detain.

“Instead of doing work out in the community, businesses are having to take time away from their core business to educate their legally permitted employees on their rights,” Clark said.

Clark also pointed to non-immigrant businesses stepping up to bring attention to the plight of immigrant-owned businesses, highlighting the efforts of Recovery Bikes to organize a gathering outside of Holy Land last Sunday.

“[Holy Land] has shared that their foot traffic is down as well, and so it was an attempt to get people to gather and shop there,” Clark said.

The specter of a lengthy detention

A common theme was that even those who are not in direct threat of being deported feared being detained for lengthy periods of time, depriving them of needed wages and putting them in potential legal jeopardy.

Wadi of Holy Land, who is also an American citizen, echoed these concerns for himself and his workers. He said he doesn’t carry his passport with him, but after hearing rumors of people being detained for two or three weeks, he is wondering if he should. At the same time, the idea of being forced to carry proof of citizenship feels antithetical to the idea of being in a country where all citizens are treated equally.

“I’m not sure, to be honest, what ICE procedures are to decide who to detain. Is it by your accent or by the look of your skin or by the clothes you’re wearing?” he said.

He highlighted his concerns for his 85-year-old mother, who often walks around the neighborhood. That never used to be a cause for concern, but suddenly, her daily walks fill him with apprehension.

“People fear because they don’t know who will knock on their door tomorrow and if those who knock will follow the rules that we expect in the United States, which we believe is a free country of laws,” Wadi said.

Holy Land’s employees, who include immigrants from Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, are also concerned about what to do if they are inadvertently detained. Wadi has heard stories from them about relatives who went through similar situations in Chicago, another target of the federal government’s immigration crackdown.

To mitigate some of their concerns, Holy Land has held all-staff meetings to explain to employees what their rights are and what to do in case they are harassed or detained.

Holy Land has also gone a step further and hired an immigration law firm that employees and their families can call at any time for legal help or guidance if they run into trouble with immigration authorities.

Wadi repeatedly emphasized that he is not opposed to immigration enforcement in principle. Like many other Americans, according to polls, he does not want undocumented violent criminals to be able to roam the streets.

“But there are many ways that we can implement this procedure without hurting the general public, without making them concerned or worried. It gives the impression that the good and the bad [immigrants] are the same,” he said.

El Bal, of Salam Barbershop, agreed that there was a general sense of foreboding and isolation in immigrant neighborhoods, despite some efforts by non-immigrant Minnesotans to show solidarity.

“It feels like a cloud hanging over all of us, it doesn’t matter if you have papers or not. And of course we’re used to cloudy weather this time of year,” he said, gesturing to the snow falling outside of his empty barbershop.

“But this time it’s not out there, it’s more in here,” he said, pointing to his chest.",https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICE-OUT-rally-120825-es_8-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 18:57:58.943613

One striking retelling of the Christmas story, at Lake Street church in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, features baby Jesus lying in a manger in the snow – but wrapped in the kind of thin, foil blankets given out in emergencies and regularly as bedding to ICE detainees, and with his wrists zip-tied.

The figure of Mary stands nearby just outside the church, wearing a gas mask, which anti-ICE protesters have been wearing to protect against teargas. She is flanked by figures of Roman soldiers, which the Bible depicts as having detained Jesus prior to his execution, but with those in the display now dressed in tactical vests labeled “ICE.”

At another location in Chicago, Urban Village church, the models of Jesus, Mary and Joseph are nowhere to be seen alongside the camels, donkeys, shepherds and wise men bearing gifts in the traditional nativity scene. Instead, there is a sign that reads: “Due to ICE activity in our community the Holy Family is in hiding.”

The displays are extensions of the prominent role taken in recent protests against the aggressive federal immigration enforcement by faith leaders, especially in Chicago and New York.

Similar political statements are also being made at churches in other states. At St Susanna parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, the tiny figure of Christ was removed from its nativity scene. In its place is a hand-painted sign reading: “ICE was here.”

The Catholic church stood defiant despite complaints from leadership of the local archdiocese and of ICE, local media reported.

According to some people behind the displays, portraying the ancient story of Christ’s birth in a contemporary political frame helps bring attention to the Trump administration’s agenda. They say that the holy family’s status as refugees represents the real fears and experiences of families in their communities, including separation from loved ones and the deportation of working family members leading to a loss of income.

Christmas is a time “when we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something”, Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street, said. He said the Baptist congregation created another nativity scene in a previous year showing Jesus lying in rubble. It was, he said, a “plea for peace” in Gaza.

During the first Trump administration in 2018, parishioners at St Susanna erected a display with baby Jesus constrained in a cage, replicating the president’s policy at the time of separating migrant families and locking up children at the US-Mexico border.

Another year, they depicted Jesus’s body floating in water polluted with plastic in a protest to highlight the climate crisis.

St Susanna is part of a multi-church refugee support committee that has worked with refugee families since 2019, helping many find housing, enroll in school, learn English and secure work.

Meanwhile, back at Evanston’s United Methodist church, the figure of Joseph blew down in a storm and was too damaged to be put back up. A sign reads: “Joseph didn’t make it. We hold this space to honor and remember all the victims of immigration enforcement terror.”

Jillian Westerfield, associate minister of Lake Street church of Evanston, said critics either don’t fully understand the message or “find it really challenging to their conscience and are lashing out at the art rather than engaging with what the actual message is”.

As the Trump administration pushes forward with its goal of removing a million people, the presence of a government-owned deportation fleet represents the most physical manifestation yet of that ambition.","The United States government has quietly taken one of the largest logistical steps in years to expand its immigration enforcement capacity. This expansion reflects the policies of the Trump administration, particularly affecting cases of deportation under ICE. According to a detailed report from The Washington Post, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) signed a contract worth roughly US$140 million to acquire six Boeing 737 aircraft that will be used exclusively for ICE deportation flights.

For the first time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will operate its own dedicated fleet for large-scale removals, a move that signals how far President Donald Trump is willing to go to fulfill his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people during his term.

The aircraft will be operated by ICE Air Operations, the little-known aviation division within the agency responsible for transporting detained migrants both within the United States and to their home countries. ICE Air has long chartered planes from private companies, but a government-owned fleet elevates the scale, permanence, and efficiency of mass deportations.

The purchase of these planes did not emerge from a new congressional debate. The Post reports that the funding came from money previously approved by Congress through the Republican tax reform package. That legislation set aside an estimated US$170 billion for border and immigration-related initiatives, allowing the administration to rapidly expand detention, processing, and removal capacity without significant new scrutiny.

With this investment, the United States is not only increasing the speed of deportations but also reshaping how the core machinery of enforcement operates. The real debate now centers on whether ICE’s expanded power can be checked by meaningful oversight that prevents abuses, discrimination, and the targeting of vulnerable immigrant communities.

A new deportation fleet marks a turning point in US immigration enforcement

The existence of ICE Air Operations is not widely known among the general public, yet it plays a crucial role in the country’s enforcement system. It is essentially the agency’s flight network, responsible for transporting tens of thousands of migrants each year from detention centers to airports across the country and ultimately to their countries of origin.

These flights often resemble logistical military operations. ICE coordinates with foreign governments, local law enforcement, and airport authorities to move groups of migrants through tightly controlled schedules. Until now, the entire system depended on leasing aircraft from commercial contractors. Owning a fleet allows ICE to operate on its own timetable, expand routes, and deploy flights in response to political priorities rather than availability from private companies.

This structural shift signals a major evolution: Deportation flights will no longer be limited by contracting delays or cost fluctuations. It also suggests that the administration intends to normalize large-scale deportations as a permanent feature of federal immigration policy rather than a temporary response to surges in migration.

The decision arrives at a time when Trump has repeatedly emphasized what he calls a national emergency at the southern border. While much of his rhetoric centers on deterrence — through policies involving asylum restrictions, detention expansion, and cross-border enforcement agreements — the purchase of the Boeing 737s moves beyond deterrence and toward long-term operational readiness. The ability to deport large numbers of people quickly is now a built-in capability, not a theoretical talking point.

Inside ICE’s growing authority and the urgent debate over oversight and abuse prevention

Even with existing laws, ICE already holds significant authority over arrests, detentions, and removals. With a dedicated aircraft fleet, that power takes on an added dimension. Deportation logistics become faster and less dependent on external actors, and the agency gains greater control over who is moved, when, and how.

This raises an important question: What safeguards exist to prevent these new tools from becoming instruments of overreach?

ICE’s authority is rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the agency to apprehend individuals suspected of violating immigration law, place them in administrative detention, and carry out final orders of removal. However, critics argue that these laws give ICE too much discretion, particularly in determining priorities and deciding whom to detain. When this discretion expands alongside operational capacity, the potential for discriminatory practices grows as well.

Civil rights organizations warn that an enlarged deportation system without proper oversight risks encouraging profiling, accelerated removals without due process, and widespread enforcement sweeps in immigrant communities. To mitigate these risks, oversight mechanisms must become more robust. These include congressional investigations, independent inspectors-general, greater transparency in flight data, and stronger limitations on how ICE selects individuals for enforcement actions.

Some lawmakers have also argued that community-based alternatives and legal counseling programs should play a larger role in ensuring that migrants understand their rights before being placed into removal proceedings. Without these protections, the new fleet could intensify fears among immigrant families and reduce cooperation with local authorities, ultimately harming public safety.

The administration has not yet announced whether it plans to update internal guidelines to adapt to ICE’s expanded capabilities. Officials argue that the same rules and standards will apply, but immigration experts stress that the scale of operations requires proactive planning — not reactive assurances — to prevent abuses.

Human Rights First raises alarms as deportations soar under Trump’s agenda

Human Rights First, a leading human rights advocacy organization, has been vocal about the implications of the administration’s deportation strategy. The group reports that deportations under Trump have already increased by 79%, a figure that reflects not only expanded capacity but also a shift in priorities that targets a broader range of migrants, including those with long-standing ties to the United States.

The organization warns that the increase in removal operations is accompanied by rising concerns about due-process violations, including rushed asylum screenings, inadequate access to legal representation, and inconsistent application of protections for people fleeing violence or persecution. Human Rights First argues that a larger deportation fleet could magnify these problems unless proper oversight is built into every stage of the process.

Their research also highlights the psychological and humanitarian consequences of mass deportation, especially on families and mixed-status households. When enforcement actions escalate, children often face the collateral trauma of losing parents or caregivers, even when those family members have no criminal history and pose no public safety risk.

Human Rights First also stresses that the United States has international obligations under refugee and human rights law. The group fears that rapid-turnaround deportation flights could reduce the time available to evaluate asylum claims thoroughly, increasing the likelihood that genuine refugees will be returned to dangerous situations.

Their overall conclusion is clear: Expanding deportation infrastructure without equally expanding legal safeguards, humanitarian processes, and accountability systems puts immigrant communities at greater risk. They argue that enforcement should not outpace protections, and that the government must treat efficiency and human rights as shared priorities, not competing ones.

The acquisition of six Boeing 737s is more than a budget decision; it is a signal of the United States’ evolving immigration posture. As the Trump administration pushes forward with its goal of removing a million people, the presence of a government-owned deportation fleet represents the most physical manifestation yet of that ambition. What happens next will depend on how ICE uses its new authority, how Congress asserts its oversight powers, and how civil society continues to monitor and challenge any abuses that arise.

In the end, the real question is not only how many people the government can deport, but whether the country can uphold fairness, legality, and human dignity while doing so.",https://colombiaone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICE-Agents-Credit-ICE-Public-Domain.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:59:00.097941

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was grilled Thursday on Capitol Hill about military veterans deported during the immigration crackdown launched earlier this year, including in Los Angeles.

“Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,” Noem responded when questioned by Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.).

An aide then held up a tablet showing a Zoom connection with Purple Heart recipient Sae Joon Park in South Korea. The congressman argued that Park had “sacrificed more for this country than most people ever have” and asked Noem if she would investigate Park’s case given her discretion as a cabinet member. Noem pledged to “absolutely look at his case.”

Park, reached in Seoul on Thursday night, said he was skeptical that Noem would follow through on her promise, but said that he had “goosebumps” watching the congressional hearing.

“It was amazing. And then I’m getting tons of phone calls from all my friends back home and everywhere else. I’m so very grateful for everything that happened today,” Park, 56, said, noting that friends told him that a clip of his story appeared on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show Thursday night.

The late-night host featured footage of Park’s moment in the congressional hearing in his opening monologue.

“Is anyone OK with this? Seriously, all kidding aside, we deported a veteran with a Purple Heart?” Kimmel said, adding that Republicans “claim to care so much about veterans, but they don’t at all.”

Park legally immigrated to the United States when he was 7, grew up in Koreatown and the San Fernando Valley, and joined the Army after graduating from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks in 1988.

The green card holder was deployed to Panama in 1989 as the U.S. tried to depose the nation’s de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega. Park was shot twice and honorably discharged. Suffering PTSD, he self-medicated with illicit drugs, went to prison after jumping bail on drug possession charges, became sober and raised two children in Hawaii.

Earlier this year, when Park checked in for his annual meeting with federal officials to verify his sobriety and employment, he was given the option of being immediately detained and deported, or wearing an ankle monitor for three weeks as he got his affairs in order before leaving the country for a decade.

At the time, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Park had an “extensive criminal history” and had been given a final removal order, with the option to self-deport.

Park chose to leave the country voluntarily. He initially struggled to acclimate in a nation he hasn’t lived in since he was a child, but said Thursday night that his mental state — and his Korean language skills — have improved.

“It hasn’t been easy. Of course, I miss home like crazy,” he said. “I’m doing the best I can. I’m usually a very positive person, so I feel like everything happens for a reason, and I’m just trying to hang in there until hopefully I make it back home.”

Among Park’s top concerns when he left the United States in June was that his mother, who is 86 and struggling with dementia, would pass away while he couldn’t return to the county. But her lack of awareness about his situation has been somewhat of a strange blessing, Park said.

“She really doesn’t know I’m even here. So every time I talk to her, she’s like, ‘Oh, where are you,’ and I tell her, and she’s like, ‘Oh, when are you coming home? Oh, why are you there?’” Park said. “In a weird way, it’s kind of good because she doesn’t have to worry about me all the time. But at the same time, I would love to be next to her while she’s going through this.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbe1df7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+112/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F77%2Fab%2F2cde4195493ba2214c752aa501ad%2Fla-me-army-veteran-purple-heart-self-deports002.JPG,N,,2025-12-12 15:57:15.245474

""When you stand in solidarity with people you love, it's hard not to take action,"" said Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator for the office. She also emphasized a need for community activism and advocacy against ICE's no-bid contract with CoreCivic.

ICE has used emergency funding to award no-bid contracts, instead of the usual competitive bidding, with CoreCivic and other private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers amid the Trump administration's increased deportation enforcement.

Hernandez told the National Catholic Reporter that the Sisters of Leavenworth are involved in this issue because it conflicts with their beliefs. She said the facility is not good for the community nor safe for the detainees and employees.

""We do things through the lens of Catholic social teaching — human dignity, responsibility and solidarity. None of those are fulfilled by having an ICE detention facility run by a private prison corporation with a long history of abuse and neglect and stripping people of their civil rights and human dignity within their doors.""

The private prison corporation, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America, stopped housing inmates at the facility in 2021.

It was closed by the U.S. Justice Department after reports of understaffing, injuries, lack of local law enforcement access and repeated sewer system problems. The conditions were documented by the American Civil Liberties Union and also by the Justice Department in a 129-page audit report. Correctional officer vacancies reached a high of 23% and closure of some security posts, according to the report.

The City of Leavenworth sought in its petition to the county district court to allow a special use permit. The petition quotes U.S. District Court Judge Julie A. Robinson, in United States vs. Mathew Clark, who wrote of the earlier operation of the facility: ""The only way I could describe it frankly, what's going on at CoreCivic right now, is 'it's an absolute hell hole.'""

The City of Leavenworth filed a court challenge to require a use permit, and on Nov. 24, U.S. District Court Judge Toby Crouse dismissed a federal lawsuit filed by CoreCivic against the city. Hearings are now scheduled to take place in February.

The city's petition stated that CoreCivic was embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff.""

William Rogers, a former correctional officer at the Leavenworth facility, said he had been assaulted seven times at the facility, which he blamed on a lack of staffing.

He told NCR that inmates were to receive an hour of daily outside recreation which was eliminated sometimes for a week when staff wasn't available. Also on hold were requests for supplies and phone calls. ""Our inaction caused them to take action, and I understood it,"" he said of the violence that resulted.

The ACLU of Kansas issued a statement that ""CoreCivic's severe understaffing and profit-driven shortcuts ensured that stabbings, suicides, and homicides occurred with alarming frequency. Weapons, drugs, and other contraband were a common occurrence. In addition to all of the violence, CoreCivic neglected basic human needs in its Leavenworth facility, restricting food, curtailing or cutting off contact with legal counsel and family, limiting medical care and even basic necessities like showers.""

Similarly, migrants in custody are routinely subject to cruelty, neglect and dehumanization, according to a report from Amnesty International, which cited facilities in Florida, Arizona, Texas and Louisiana. Human Rights Watch reports a lack of food and water, unsanitary conditions and medical neglect at the ICE-run Krome Detention Facility in Florida.

Esmie Tseng, communications director of the ACLU of Kansas, told NCR that the opposition to the detention facility in Leavenworth comes from people of a variety of backgrounds who remember CoreCivic's previous failings and do not want it to operate without accountability.

""The Sisters of Charity have been a consistent voice and serve as a conscience for the rest of the community,"" Tseng said. ""They've given a voice to that human element.""

She also emphasized that the people of Leavenworth will not back away from CoreCivic. As she put it: ""The community has not forgotten what they put this city through.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-12/image1%20KENNY%20ICE.jpg?h=bf44842c&itok=t7qSrxzo,N,,2025-12-12 17:57:49.214072

It can continue on this path of extreme cruelty and systemic abuse, or it can uphold human rights and dignity for all people.","Gabriel Garcia-Aviles was a 56-year-old grandfather with a work permit who’d been living in the U.S. for over 30 years. He was a beloved member of his Southern California community.

This fall, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained Garcia-Aviles and sent him to the Adelanto immigration detention center. He died around a week later, with ICE only informing his family that he was in critical condition once he was on his deathbed.

At the hospital, his daughter Mariel found him “unconscious, intubated,” and with “dried blood on his forehead.” He had “a cut on his tongue and blood on his lips” and “broken teeth and bruising on his body,” according to reporting from L.A. Taco. No clear cause of death was given, leaving his family shattered and still searching for answers.

That’s the second death this year at Adelanto.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old former DACA recipient from Orange County, lived in the U.S. for nearly 35 years. ICE apprehended him while he was working at a car wash and sent him to Adelanto on August 22. He died a month later of an abscess after reportedly being denied lifesaving medical treatment.

ICE didn’t inform his family that he’d been hospitalized. They only learned of Ayala-Uribe’s death the following day after a police visit.

At least 25 people have died in ICE custody since President Trump returned to office, making 2025 the deadliest year for people in ICE custody since 2004. Over 65,000 others remain detained, also the highest number in years. Immigrants with no criminal record remain the largest group in immigration detention. According to ProPublica, ICE has also detained over 170 U.S. citizens this year.

Adelanto, owned and operated by the GEO Group, is among ICE’s sprawling network of mostly private, for-profit detention facilities notorious for human rights abuses. But it’s hardly alone.

From the Krome Detention Center in Florida to the Karnes County detention facility in Texas, people in ICE custody are routinely subjected to abysmal conditions and medical neglect. The detention population has increased by 50 percent this year, which experts have warned could lead to more deaths.

Rights groups have been issuing warnings like these for years.

In 2024, the ACLU and Physicians for Human Rights examined the deaths of 52 people who died in ICE custody between 2017 to 2021 and concluded that 95 percent of those deaths would have been “preventable or possibly preventable” with appropriate medical care. The researchers also found ICE’s oversight and accountability mechanisms “critically flawed.”

These problems have only worsened as immigration arrests have escalated as part of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda. Recent U.S. Senate investigations uncovered dozens of cases of medical neglect, insufficient or rotten food, foul water, and pregnant women forced to sleep on the floor in ICE detention facilities this year.

Watchdog groups and lawmakers have found that ICE has repeatedly failed to comply with its own protocols, ignored congressional inquiries, and denied members of Congress entry to facilities, even though they have the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits.

ICE acts increasingly like a rogue agency, refusing to follow U.S. and international law. Yet the “Big Beautiful Bill” Trump signed this year includes $45 billion for ICE to build new prisons housing adults and children, which all but ensures more abuses and preventable deaths. Meanwhile, private prison companies continue to profit.

It doesn’t have to be this way. More oversight would help safeguard civil and human rights. But ultimately Congress must defund and dismantle ICE, end the unnecessary and inhumane system of immigration detention, and create more legal pathways to citizenship, among other reforms.

Legislation recently introduced by U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Adam Smith would be a step forward. If passed, it would repeal mandatory detention and phase out privatized detention.

As more families are ripped apart, our nation of immigrants stands at a crossroads. It can continue on this path of extreme cruelty and systemic abuse, or it can uphold human rights and dignity for all people.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3933-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:59:04.722427

The ruling was issued by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after a three-judge panel — judges Thomas Kirsch, John Lee and Doris Pryor — heard arguments last week from the ACLU and National Immigrant Justice Center, which represent the plaintiffs, and the federal government.

The hearing stemmed from the federal government’s appeal in a legal battle regarding a 2022 consent decree, which bans warrantless civil immigration arrests in Illinois.

In October, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings extended the three-year consent decree through February after he found that ICE arrested 22 people without a warrant.

Then, in November, Cummings ordered the release of 442 people detained by ICE between June and Oct. 7 who had not been deported and were not deemed a public safety threat, according to court records.

Those 442 people are being reviewed as potential members of a class-action lawsuit alleging they were unlawfully detained without a warrant in violation of the 2022 consent decree.

In last week’s hearing before the federal appeals court, Justice Department lawyers argued Cummings lacked the authority to extend the consent decree or order the blanket release of detainees, contending federal law bars class-wide court intervention in immigration detention.

They also claimed many of those detained were “applicants for admission,” a legal term typically used for people stopped at the border or airport while trying to enter the United States illegally, and who are therefore subject to mandatory detention.

The appeals court in its ruling Thursday partially blocked Cummings’ order requiring the release of the 442 people, ruling the judge went too far by ordering releases without individualized determinations. But the appeals court agreed that Cummings was within his rights to extend the consent decree through February.

The ruling also dealt a setback to the Trump administration, rejecting its interpretation of “applicants for admission,” which the government has used to argue detainees are subject to mandatory detention even when they would otherwise be eligible for release.

In a written decision, the judges said immigration law has long drawn a distinction between people seeking to enter the United States and those arrested inside the country, adding that people picked up by ICE in Chicago could not automatically be treated as if they were trying to enter the country.

Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, said his team is taking the decision positively, calling the court’s ruling on “applicants for admission” the most significant part. He noted the 7th Circuit is the first federal appeals court to hear and reject the Trump administration’s reading of immigration law.

The Trump administration’s immigration detention policy has been challenged in at least 362 cases in federal district courts, according to a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Challengers have prevailed in 350 of those cases.

The appeals court decision does allow detainees to be released on a case-by-case basis if a review confirms they were arrested in violation of the consent decree. Based on preliminary documents previously released by the government to NIJC and the ACLU in 110 cases, 46 were deemed by the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice to be in violation of the consent decree.

“Given the number of instances where the parties have agreed that the rights of the class members were violated, it stands to reason that a significant number of additional violations will be uncovered as plaintiffs receive and analyze the arrest records of the remaining arrestees,” according to the appeals court decision.

Fleming said the NIJC and the ACLU plan to return to district court to “hold feet to the fire” and compel the release of records for people who remain in immigration custody. The groups will use those records to make individual determinations about who should be released based on whether they were subjected to unlawful warrantless arrests, as allowed by the court’s decision.

The South Texas charity is part of Catholic Charities USA and is a branch of the Diocese of Brownsville. Its executive director, Sister Norma Pimentel, has become known globally for her advocacy work for migrants.

Pimentel, who founded the migrant shelter in 2014 and has run it since, was considered one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People of 2020” and received a medallion of excellence from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in 2023. During Pope Frances’ reign, she was considered the “Pope’s Favorite Nun.”

But as of last month, the organization has been barred from receiving federal funds for six years, according to documents the government shared with Fox News, after the Department of Homeland Security said an investigation found multiple grant violations, such as inconsistent records on migrants.

The audit also found nearly 250 instances in which the nonprofit used federal funds outside of the 45-day window allowed after a migrant is released, according to Fox News.

In a statement, CCRGV said it was using federal funds to help migrants brought to them by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “individuals who were released by CBP with a document that gave them permission to travel to their points of destination.”

The organization did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear how much the charity depends on federal funds to run its operations, but its statement said it “remains committed to serve each person who comes seeking our help with respect and compassion.”

The shelter provides migrants released from federal custody a range of services, such as showers, meals and clothes, serving as a rest stop before they continue to other destinations in the U.S.

“Those on the front lines of our humanitarian outreach know the work we do truly helps restore human dignity,” Pimentel said in the statement. “I take very seriously every single dollar entrusted to us.”

The organization said it’s committed to complying with federal grant requirements and is working to become eligible to receive funding again.

When the charity commemorated its decade of operations last year, Pimentel told Border Report that it has served over 500,000 migrants.

A few months ago, a House investigation — led by U.S. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, and Rep. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, also a member of the committee — probed more than 200 organizations they accused of “providing services or support to inadmissible aliens during the Biden-Harris administration’s historic border crisis.”

Four organizations were listed as the investigation’s priority, including Catholic Charities USA. The others were the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Global Refuge, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the latter of which is the focus of a criminal investigation recently launched by Gov.

Allowing DHS to continue to pick DoD’s pockets puts our military readiness at risk.“ Under the Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement.
Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement.
“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer.
The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies.","Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley said today they have joined Senate and House colleagues to release a new report detailing the Trump administration’s diversion of funds and resources from the Department of Defense to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement, and its impact on readiness and morale of U.S. troops.

“The investigation found that the Department of Defense (DoD) has obligated over $2 billion in support of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and immigration enforcement in 2025, diverting it from the intended use – our national security and military servicemembers,” the lawmakers wrote to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. “This is a baffling waste of military resources considering the appropriation of $170 billion to DHS to fund immigration enforcement earlier this year. We are particularly concerned that DHS may not be reimbursing DoD for these funds. Allowing DHS to continue to pick DoD’s pockets puts our military readiness at risk.“

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement. The report is the first detailed review of the Pentagon’s spending on immigration, and found that DoD has committed at least $2 billion to support immigration enforcement through mobilizing and deploying troops to U.S. cities and the Southern border, deporting and transporting immigrants on military aircrafts, detaining individuals on U.S. military installations and more.

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts with money allocated for other DoD projects including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” the lawmakers continued.

The lawmakers’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” the lawmakers wrote. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was “understaffed because roughly half its members (were) deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse among service members, and may have even contributed to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

“The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” the lawmakers wrote.

The coalition directed follow-up questions to Secretary Hegseth about the number of troops currently supporting immigration enforcement, how long military units will be supporting DHS, and whether DHS will reimburse the military.

Wyden and Merkley have been continuous advocates for government transparency and accountability. In October, both Oregon senators called on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to probe the cost of the Trump Administration’s brazen decision to deploy National Guard personnel to U.S. cities.

In November, after the Coast Guard announced the 90-mile relocation of a search-and-rescue helicopter from Newport and the possible installation of a new ICE facility, Wyden and Merkley demanded answers from DHS on the changes. After receiving no answer, Wyden called on the Coast Guard to meet ahead of his Lincoln County town hall to explain the helicopter’s departure. In December, Merkley, Wyden and Representative Val Hoyle announced that Admiral Kevin Lunday, Acting Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, committed to keeping the helicopter in Newport.

The report on the diversion of military resources was led by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Representative John Garamendi, D-Calif. In addition to Wyden and Merkley, the report was co-authored by U.S. Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Adam Schiff, D- Calif., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Representatives Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.

Since 2016, the ESTA has included an optional question asking travellers to disclose their social media information.
Travellers from non-Visa Waiver Program countries have been required to disclose their social media handles since 2019.
“Even travellers who post publicly on social media typically maintain some expectation of obscurity, if not privacy, online.
And those who use pseudonymous social media handles or email addresses would be directly deprived of their online anonymity,” she said.","The United States is planning to require some visitors to provide their social media history from the past five years, according to US President Donald Trump’s administration.

This requirement will apply to visitors who do not need a visa to enter the US.

Here is a closer look at this proposal:

What is the US planning to do?

The proposal was announced on the Federal Register by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Wednesday. It will enable officials to collect up to five years of social media history from travellers from certain visa-waiver countries before they can enter the country.

The proposal states that this mandatory social media history disclosure is in line with Executive Order 14161, signed by Trump in January 2025.

That order, titled “Protecting the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats”, required US government agencies to increase their vetting of foreign nationals entering the country.

Who would this affect?

The requirement will apply to travellers using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) under the US’s Visa Waiver Program.

The Visa Waiver Program permits citizens of 42 countries – including the United Kingdom, Germany, Qatar, Greece, Malta, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea – to travel to the US for tourism or business purposes for up to 90 days.

At present, the ESTA automatically screens applicants and grants travel approval without requiring an in-person interview at a US embassy or consulate, unlike standard visa applications. Applicants are required to provide a more limited set of information, such as their parents’ names, current email address and details of any past criminal record.

Since 2016, the ESTA has included an optional question asking travellers to disclose their social media information.

How would this work?

Once the proposal comes into effect, visitors will be required to provide CBP with a list of their social media handles or usernames used over the past five years.

The visitors would not have to give CBP their social media log‑in credentials or passwords. They will use this information to review the publicly accessible information on the social media profiles of these visitors.

The new notice also states that travellers will have to provide additional personal information, including all telephone numbers used over the past five years and email addresses used over the previous 10 years.

Authorities also said they plan to add what are described as “high-value data fields” to the ESTA application “when feasible”. These will include metadata from electronically submitted photographs, extensive personal details about applicants’ family members, such as their places of birth and telephone numbers used over the past five years, as well as biometric information, including fingerprints, DNA and iris data.

The announcement did not include information about what the administration will be looking for within social media accounts of visitors or why it is asking for that information.

It is unclear when the proposal will take effect. However, the public now has 60 days to submit comments about the proposed changes before they are finalised, the notice in the Federal Register states.

Why is the US government doing this now?

Travellers from non-Visa Waiver Program countries have been required to disclose their social media handles since 2019. This is an extension of that.

That measure was first introduced by the Trump administration during his first term as president, and was kept in place during President Joe Biden’s tenure.

The CBP and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have been seeking to significantly broaden the existing social media disclosure rules for some time.

“USCIS has proposed to extend the social media disclosure requirement to applicants for other immigration benefits as well – up through naturalisation,” Caroline DeCell, a senior staff attorney and legislative adviser at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, told Al Jazeera.

In June this year, the State Department also announced that it now requires all F, M and J visa applicants to make their social media profiles public as part of enhanced screening to identify national security threats.

Most social media platforms allow users to either keep their profiles private or make them public.

Private profiles can only be viewed by people actively added as friends – this includes all posts, photos, videos or other content posted by the profile user. Content posted on public profiles can be viewed by anyone.

This relates to student visas for those enrolled in accredited colleges, or in vocational or technical, non‑academic educational programmes. It also covers exchange visitors participating in approved exchange study programmes.

“A US visa is a privilege, not a right,” the State Department statement from June said.

What are the privacy implications of this?

DeCell said that if the CBP proposal is approved, the privacy implications would be “significant” as it will require disclosure not only of social media handles, but also of all phone numbers used in the past five years and email addresses used in the past 10 years, as well as biometric data.

“Even travellers who post publicly on social media typically maintain some expectation of obscurity, if not privacy, online. And those who use pseudonymous social media handles or email addresses would be directly deprived of their online anonymity,” she said.

DeCell added that if the USCIS proposal to seek this information for all immigration visa and citizenship applicants is also approved, besides the CBP proposal for travellers from visa waiver countries, “then nearly every non-US citizen who seeks to enter or remain in the United States would be subject to indefinite social media surveillance by the US government”.

Under the USCIS proposal, US citizens who petition in support of their relatives’ immigration applications would also be subjected to this “surveillance”.

What are the implications for freedom of speech?

The First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, the press and peaceful assembly.

However, DeCell warned that this expanding system will deter free speech online and many foreigners will be put off from travelling to the US, whether for work or leisure.

“It’s a massive blow to First Amendment freedoms,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/reuters_693bc9b0-1765525936.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-12 17:57:41.183473

Policymakers across the political spectrum have taken important steps to protect Americans from harmful AI through fair, transparent, and responsible AI standards at the state level.
Just yesterday, New York signed two bills into law to protect consumers and boost AI transparency in the film industry.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) is deeply alarmed by President Trump’s Executive Order to sue and investigate state laws which regulate artificial intelligence (AI) and directing federal agencies to withhold federal funding from states with AI laws deemed to be unfavorable.

IATSE agrees with the order’s assertion that the Trump Administration must act with Congress to establish a national framework for AI regulation and the recognition that a federal policy is needed to ensure copyrights are respected. However, preventing states from passing and enforcing AI protection before Congress acts is an invitation for lawlessness that directly threatens IATSE members and their economic livelihoods.

Recent attempts to roll back and ban state AI protections were rejected overwhelmingly by Congress and remain deeply unpopular with the public. Earlier this week, IATSE and the arts, entertainment, and media industry unions applauded the decision by Congress to exclude an AI moratorium from being forced into the National Defense Authorization Act and urged the Administration to reconsider similar attempts to limit the rights of state governments to protect their constituents.

AI has the potential to transform the entertainment industry and many others, but without clear safeguards, it poses serious risks to American workers’ jobs, privacy, and safety. The order and proposed moratorium on state-level policy both threaten to roll back essential worker protections and undermine ongoing bipartisan efforts to ensure AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly.

Policymakers across the political spectrum have taken important steps to protect Americans from harmful AI through fair, transparent, and responsible AI standards at the state level. For example, Colorado’s Algorithmic Discrimination Act addresses bias and discrimination in automated decision-making, while Florida has implemented policies governing AI in Political Advertising, non-consensual deep-fakes, and Automated Decision-Making. Just yesterday, New York signed two bills into law to protect consumers and boost AI transparency in the film industry.

Rather than seeking to eliminate the only safeguards we have, the federal government should learn from these state efforts to develop a strong, comprehensive framework that ensures AI benefits workers and society.

The Executive Order’s approach takes this harm one step further, seeking to punish states that take action and proactively address pitfalls of AI technology and use, leaving workers vulnerable to misuse and displacement.

IATSE urges policymakers to reject any attempt to strip states of their right to protect working people and to ensure that AI regulation at all levels prioritizes fairness, transparency, and accountability.",https://iatse.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IATSE-COMMISSION-ON-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE.png,N,,2025-12-12 16:58:53.920545

It is not just that the human rights lawyer who wrote a key text on the Human Rights Act 1998 has become, as prime minister, an advocate of the act’s undoing, along with all the consequences for migrant families that will flow from that. It is that Starmer shows through this the complete dearth of ideas available to European social democracy.

Faced with the growth of Hayekian anti-state politics in the 1970s and 1980s, social democratic parties abandoned the idea of ameliorating the worst impacts of capitalism and became little more than a reserve managerial class occasionally allowed to manage. The problem is that they are now entirely devoid of coherent politics.

Europe’s ageing populations and stagflating economies desperately need immigrant labour. Facing a rightwing discourse that is as wrong on immigration as it is on the climate crisis, Starmer and co can’t mount an ideological retort, and instead bleat about “legitimate concerns”, falling into line with Donald Trump’s power play about the “stark prospect of civilisational erasure” (‘Cultivate resistance’: policy paper lays bare Trump support for Europe’s far right, 5 December).

When John F Kennedy was killed, Malcolm X said the chickens were coming home to roost. Starmer’s attack on the European convention on human rights is more like turkeys dressing up to celebrate Christmas.

Keir Starmer and Mette Frederiksen claim to be speaking for all citizens when they say want to amend the ECHR in order to “control our borders” (We must protect our borders to defend our democracies. Here’s how, 9 December). They don’t speak for me, and, I’d argue, a majority of citizens whose voices never get heard in the press or in government policy.

Migrants – whether refugees or “economic migrants” – have made this country better culturally and economically, bringing in new ideas, entrepreneurialism and some wonderful friends and neighbours.

Freedom of movement is a core part of the human experience throughout time, and the ECHR doesn’t just protect refugees, it defends the rights of all of us, so chipping away at it will impoverish our freedoms when we need them more than ever. Who knows when people in the UK might need to flee a natural or human-made disaster?

Starmer’s government is Blue Labour through and through, echoing many bot-inspired Maga talking points from migration to disability because they have little else to offer. It is not the Labour party I know and have voted for.

Let me get this straight. Donald Trump accuses Europe of being weak on immigration (Trump lambasts ‘weak’ and ‘decaying’ Europe and hints at walking away from Ukraine, 9 December), and hours later our leaders write that they want to take tougher action to protect our borders. I don’t think most Europeans want Europe to become Little America. We want to be a continent where human rights matter, and where our politicians, instead of scapegoating our migrant friends and neighbours, tackle the real crises we face: housing, wages, and public service cuts.

To defend our democracies, we need our leaders to address extreme wealth inequalities, not protect our borders from vulnerable people. The rise in popularity of green and truly progressive parties shows that if they are not willing to act for the many, we will replace their politics of fat cats and division with the politics of care and solidarity.

A federal judge freed Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention yesterday. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what Immigration and Customs Enforcement called an ""administrative error."" He was eventually brought back and detained in the U.S. A federal judge ruled that the government failed to produce a lawful order for his removal from the U.S. This decision came just as lawmakers were questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about President Trump's compliance with court orders.

🎧 The White House says it will appeal this decision, according to NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Abrego Garcia's lawyers say the ruling is an extraordinary victory, not only for their client, but also for due process. Democrats invited family members of people who were deported or put in detention to the hearing as examples of the impact of immigration enforcement. Noem said she believes immigrants who entered the U.S. under former President Biden pose the biggest threat to national security. Noem's department is reopening the cases of refugees admitted under the Biden administration and is calling for a review of asylum applications.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Ukrainian people would need to speak through a referendum for his country to surrender territory, which the U.S. wants Ukraine to do as part of a peace deal with Russia. Zelenskyy and other Europeans are working to offer answers and alternatives to pressure from Trump's bid to end the war.

🎧 Zelenskyy is engaging with the Trump administration's most painful proposals to show that Ukraine is negotiating in good faith, NPR's Joanna Kakissis tells Up First. Giving up territory has been a red line for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy says he is examining the possibility of elections over the next 90 days or a referendum on giving up parts of eastern Ukraine to help end the war. Ukraine has not held elections because the country is under martial law due to the Russian invasion, and the constitution forbids elections during wartime, Kakissis says. Public opinion polls show that most Ukrainians think holding elections now is a terrible idea.

The Indiana Senate voted 31 to 19 yesterday against the congressional redistricting that the president called for to help Republicans win next year's midterm elections. The defeat comes in a state where 40 of the 50 members of the Senate are Republicans. It marks the first time members of Trump's own party voted against his redistricting campaign. The nationwide effort to reshape the midterm elections in the GOP's favor has succeeded in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina.

🎧 Indiana State Sen. Spencer Deery said redistricting for political gain opposed his conservative values, and he would fight to prevent the federal government from bullying a state. Other state lawmakers said their constituents didn't want the new map. Ben Thorp of the NPR network station WFYI says Republicans still appear to have ""tilted a couple more seats their way than Democrats."" Texas helped the GOP possibly win five more seats; Missouri and North Carolina's efforts created one more seat each. California Democrats have countered by tilting five seats their way. The question now is whether Republicans in other states will follow suit on Trump's wishes for redistricting, Thorp says.

Vijandre’s legal team is also trying to get him released from detention while his immigration case is resolved, filing its latest motion in a habeas corpus case late Monday.
Vijandre’s case highlights the Trump administration’s intensifying approach to characterizing threats to national security and what appears to be a growing number of Daca recipients caught up in its mass deportation plans.
Again, the hearing transcript does not include Vijandre’s posts on Siddiqui, but the judge asks him what they say.
“I never expected anything like that … being accused of ‘glorifying terrorism’; they attacked my religion, my faith.","Ya’akub Vijandre, a Muslim photojournalist, martial arts teacher and first responder who ICE detained in October for posting on social media, told the Guardian that the government is “attacking my faith” and that he was “concerned about the safety” of his family and friends.

Speaking in his first interview from Georgia’s Folkston detention center, the 38-year-old said guards treat detainees “like animals”, yelling at them when they don’t understand English. One guard responded to his request to use the bathroom during a visit to the detention center’s library by telling him, “just piss on yourself”.

The recently expanded facility had a total average population of about 1,650 in early November, according to Trac, an immigration data project at Syracuse University.

Vijandre was picked up by ICE in Arlington, Texas on 7 October applied for asylum on 19 November and had his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) status revoked on 2 December.

His detention and loss of lawful permission to remain in the US are based on social media posts the federal government links to terrorism. Vijandre and his legal defense team assert his posts were constitutionally protected speech that is being targeted due to Vijandre’s Muslim faith.

Vijandre’s legal team is also trying to get him released from detention while his immigration case is resolved, filing its latest motion in a habeas corpus case late Monday. Habeas corpus is a legal tool that gives a detained person the right to seek a judge’s ruling on whether their detention is unlawful.

Vijandre was born in the Philippines with the legal name of Jacob Ira Azurin Vijandre. He has lived in the US for 24 years, holding Daca status half that time – the Obama-era program designed to protect immigrants from deportation who were brought to the US as children. Daca must be renewed every two years; Vijandre’s most recent renewal was valid through May 2026.

Vijandre’s case highlights the Trump administration’s intensifying approach to characterizing threats to national security and what appears to be a growing number of Daca recipients caught up in its mass deportation plans.

Vijandre’s ordeal began when 10 cars pulled up outside his Arlington home on 7 October and detained him at gunpoint, due to social media posts the federal government saw as “glorifying terrorism”.

The posts referred to several political prisoners, as well as Islam. Samantha Hamilton, staff attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice and member of his legal team, said Vijandre’s detention is “a pure speech case … [that] cannot be divorced from Islam, with the government characterizing Ya’akub’s nonviolent speech as terrorism”.

Vijandre has been reporting on rallies and community events dealing with Palestinians and Israel, the “war on terror” and related issues for several decades, often posting on Instagram, where he has nearly 9,000 followers.

His legal team is now in its second month of a constitutional challenge to his detention, after an immigration judge ruled on 3 November that she could not release him on bond. In a 10 November amended habeas corpus petition, Vijandre’s legal team revealed details about that immigration court proceeding, including which social media posts the federal government had singled out and why.

During the hearing, the immigration judge asks Vijandre about a post on the Holy Land Foundation, which she says was “convicted of providing material aid and support to a designated terrorist organization called Hamas”.

Federal prosecutors found the Holy Land Foundation guilty of supporting terrorism in 2008, after an attempt to do so in 2007 ended in a mistrial. The five defendants asserted throughout that the foundation supported community projects and Palestinian orphans. They received sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years. Three of the five have been released.

The post on the case is not quoted in the hearing transcript cited in the amended petition, but Vijandre told the judge: “I have said that they have been wrongfully imprisoned, and that’s all I can recall right now, ma’am.” The judge asks: “[A]re you saying they were wrongfully imprisoned for supporting Hamas?” Vijandre responds that his post was drawing attention to “perceived due-process violations in their prosecution”.

She also refers to a post on Aafia Siddiqui, who received an 86-year sentence in 2010 for allegedly shooting at US military officers in Afghanistan. The Guardian reported on her case at the time.

Several human rights campaigns have sought her release in the last decade-plus, pointing to irregularities in her trial. Her lawyers filed a lawsuit last year alleging she has been subject to rape, sexual abuse and battery.

Again, the hearing transcript does not include Vijandre’s posts on Siddiqui, but the judge asks him what they say. His response: they were “highlighting the conditions that Dr Aafia Siddiqui has suffered in FMC Carswell and also in Guantanamo Bay prison and Bagram Air Base, where rape, and the violation of her detainee rights [sic]”.

The judge goes on to state that the federal government alleges he posted something about the Fort Dix Five – a mid-2000s New Jersey case involving an alleged terrorist plot filled with apparent due process issues also reported on by the Guardian. Of the three posts linked to controversial terrorist cases mentioned in the hearing, this one has not been produced by the federal government, and Vijandre said in the hearing he did not recall posting anything on the case.

Then the judge refers to two posts on Islam, including one where Vijandre “liked” a post containing a quote in English and the Shahada in Arabic – a basic pillar of the Muslim faith. The quote: “Islam today is in dire need of truthful, patient men who are inclined to work hard, who find pleasure in toil and find comfort in pain, quietly translating the needs of this stage into action … ” The government asserts that the quote appeared in a magazine linked to Islamic State.

Another religious post reads: “A Warrior of Islam can never be assassinated for DEATH IS OUR VICTORY!! It is the inescapable process for us to meet Allah; what is more victorious than that!!”

The judge questioned Vijandre about the meaning of the phrase “death is our victory”. He explains that the Qur’an “mentions that every soul will taste death, and that God has burdened us with prosperity and adversity, and that it is a test for us, and that this test is to test our gratitude and our patience”.

The judge concluded that she could not make a decision on bond because Vijandre’s posts appeared to run afoul of federal immigration law against “endorsing or espousing terroristic activity or persuad[ing] others to endorse or espouse terroristic activity or support a terrorist organization”.

The Guardian has approached ICE for comment.

Speaking from Folkston detention center, Vijandre said the hearing left him stunned. “I never expected anything like that … being accused of ‘glorifying terrorism’; they attacked my religion, my faith. They boxed me in, cornered me. I’ve seen this in movies … [but] was not expecting my faith to be attacked.”

“This is a rehearsed tactic of Islamophobia,” he added.

In the federal government’s 28 November motion to dismiss Vijandre’s habeas corpus petition, it zeroes in on the post that includes the notion, “death is our victory” as well as the alleged post on the Fort Dix 5. The assistant US attorney asserts that the former demonstrates Vijandre is “endorsing or espousing terroristic activity”, while the latter is evidence he was “soliciting funds for terrorist organizations”.

Hamilton, of Vijandre’s legal team, told the Guardian that not only has the federal government not produced the Fort Dix 5 post, a search through his Instagram account by a friend also produced no such post.

The team’s 8 December motion asserts that “Mr Vijandre’s freedom is critical, but far more is at stake here than one man’s liberty. If Mr Vijandre’s social media posts or photojournalism make him a terrorist, the executive branch’s power to detain individuals within the United States based on speech will know no limits.”

Meanwhile, Vijandre, speaking from Folkston, said he is “concerned about [his family’s] safety … them being accused of what I’m being accused of. With the rise of Islamophobia, ignorant people could use violence against my family.”

He noted that his family history includes a great-grandfather Lorenzo Fabian and grand-uncle Paulino Fabian receiving Congressional Gold Medals posthumously in 2020, for their service during the second world war. Vijandre participated in the medal ceremony with family.

He also shared previously unreported details with the Guardian about his role as part of an emergency team that helped family members of the 67 people killed in the 29 January accident involving a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines jet in Washington DC – one of the worst air accidents in decades.

A Red Cross-trained first responder, Vijandre was deployed within 24 hours of the accident, and spent the next two weeks assisting one family in particular who were “completely devastated” by losing a loved one.

Amnesty International has released a new report documenting serious human rights violations at two immigration detention centers in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz and Krome. Based on a September 2025 research mission, the report details inhuman and degrading conditions including overflowing toilets near sleeping areas, constant lighting, insect exposure, lack of privacy with cameras over toilets, denial of medical care, routine shackling, and punishment that Amnesty says can amount to torture. At Alligator Alcatraz, the absence of basic tracking systems has also led to people being held incommunicado, with families and lawyers unable to locate them.

At Krome, which is operated by a private for profit contractor, Amnesty confirmed extreme overcrowding, medical neglect, prolonged solitary confinement, unsanitary conditions, and reports of physical abuse by guards. Four of the six deaths in Florida ICE custody since October 2024 occurred at Krome. Amnesty links these abuses to Florida’s expanded use of mass detention and emergency powers under Governor Ron DeSantis, including hundreds of millions of dollars in no bid contracts for detention while funding for health care, housing, food security, and emergency response was cut. Amnesty is calling for the closure of Alligator Alcatraz, an end to state run immigration detention, and independent investigations into torture and deaths in custody.

The Trump administration might be exaggerating their employment figures, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem didn’t deny that the Trump administration was illegally deporting people with ongoing asylum cases.

Noem spiraled out during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday, after Representative Dan Goldman pressed her on the government’s efforts to deport lawful asylum-seekers. There have been mounting reports that asylum cases are being routinely dismissed by immigration judges, and the asylum-seekers are then taken into ICE custody for expedited removal.

The New York Democrat asked Noem whether she agreed that asylum was a lawful pathway to citizenship and that immigrants with ongoing asylum applications were legally in the country. Noem agreed asylum was “a lawful pathway.”

“So, if your department then deports anyone with an ongoing asylum application, you are violating the law, correct?” Goldman asked.

Noem immediately became defensive. “Joe Biden left us with a [inaudible] five billion cases backlogged,” she replied, attempting to dodge the question.

“I’m not asking about Joe Biden, I’m asking you a specific question,” Goldman said. “If your department deports anyone with an ongoing asylum application, you are violating the law, correct?”

But Noem continued to speak monotonously throughout the lawmaker’s repeated requests to answer the question, claiming that the Biden administration had “greatly violated” the asylum law.

“Why are you filibustering? Why can’t you answer the question? It’s a simple question,” Goldman asked, but the secretary continued to rant that the “asylum program was broken under the last administration.”

Clearly, Noem had no intention of openly copping to breaking the law—but Goldman said her artless obfuscation did it for her, since yes was the “obvious answer.”

“If you don’t like the asylum system, you change the asylum law. Bring it to us. We’ll work with you. I think it needs to be changed. But you can’t just decide that you’re not gonna follow the law—and asylum is a law—and deport people with ongoing applications. Unfortunately, that is exactly what’s happening,” Goldman said.

ICE attorneys at immigration hearings are increasingly asking immigration judges to dismiss asylum cases, and the Trump administration has instructed judges to grant quick dismissals. At the same time, the Trump administration has purged dozens of immigration judges and sought to recruit so-called “deportation judges” to help ramp up the government’s soft ethnic cleansing.

Health care bills are going to skyrocket next year after the Senate voted down a bill that would have extended subsidies for the Affordable Care Act on Thursday.

The bill needed 60 votes to pass, but only four Republicans broke with their party and voted to extend the subsidies that millions of Americans rely on: Senators Josh Hawley, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, and Susan Collins, resulting in a total of just 51 votes in favor. Every single Democrat in the Senate voted to extend the subsidies, while Montana Senator Steve Daines, a Republican, did not vote.

President Trump said last month that he was against extending the subsidies “because the ‘unaffordable care act’ has been a disaster.” But the real disaster is just beginning.

Health care premiums have already gone up in several states, and lower-income states, including Republican-run states like Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina, stand to suffer the most. Many Americans will likely drop their ACA health care plans, meaning that an estimated four million Americans could be without health care coverage.

Here are the 48 Republican senators who voted to end the subsidies and increase premiums:

Yet another musician has joined the choir of voices refuting the White House’s latest string of ICE advertisements.

SZA torched the Trump administration for using her music in a pro-ICE ad, claiming that the blatant intellectual property theft was really just a transparent bid to rage-bait artists into giving the violent campaign more attention.

“White House rage baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK … inhumanity +shock and aw tactics,” SZA wrote on X Wednesday. “Evil n Boring.”

The White House published a Christmas-themed montage of ICE arrests Monday set to SZA’s track “Big Boy,” focusing on the song’s reprise “it’s cuffing season”—which, in the context of the song, refers to falling into short-term relationships during the cold winter months. Not ripping people away from their families and forcing them into modern-day concentration camps.

“WE HEARD IT’S CUFFING SZN,” the White House captioned the post alongside a chain emoji. “Bad news for criminal illegal aliens. Great news for America.”

The 36-year-old R&B singer was responding to a kindred comment by her former manager, Terrence “Punch” Henderson, who said that the White House’s efforts to “provoke artist[s] to respond in order to help spread propaganda and political agendas is nasty business.”

But the platinum record-producing duo aren’t alone in their opinion. The White House has also stolen tracks from Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter for similar purposes, earning the ire of the pop music spectrum in the process.

Last week, Carpenter seemingly won her own standoff with ICE after the White House deleted another brutal arrest montage that stole her song “Juno.”

“This video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter responded to the White House video in a comment that received 1.8 million likes and more than 163 million views—roughly half of the U.S. population. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”

Homeland Security Secretary and MAGA hardliner Kristi Noem got a fact-check to her face during her Thursday morning House hearing when Democratic Representative Seth Magaziner brought in a special guest.

“How many United States military veterans have you deported?” Magaziner asked Noem.

“Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans.”

Little did she know there was one staring right at her.

“Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park. He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989,” Magaziner said. “Like many veterans, he struggled with PTSD and substance abuse after his service.... A purple heart recipient, he has sacrificed more for this country than most people ever have. Earlier this year you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn’t lived in since he was seven years old. Will you join me in thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country?”

Noem initially refused to even acknowledge Park, who was staring blankly on an iPad held up near Magaziner.

“Sir, I’m grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws—”

“Can you please tell Mr. Park why you deported him?” Magaziner asked, talking over Noem. “This man took two bullets for our country. You have broad authority, by the way, as secretary, to issue humanitarian parole, to do deferred action. Will you commit to at least looking at Mr. Park’s case to see if you can help him find a pathway back to this country that he sacrificed so much for?”

“I will absolutely look at his case.”

Magaziner also brought in another veteran whose wife had been deported.

Park was forced to self-deport over the summer due to drug possession charges linked to his military PTSD.

“ I can’t believe that this is happening in America,” he told NPR in an interview before he left. “That blows me away, like a country that I fought for.”

The Trump administration is refusing to face the facts that they are the ones responsible for the suspected national guard shooter’s presence in the country.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was grilled during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday on Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s granted asylum, which was approved in April after she took over as head of the agency.

“You blamed [the shooting of the National Guardsmen] solely on Joe Biden. Who approved the asylum for this same person?” pressed Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson after Noem finally stopped cutting him off for long enough to allow him to ask the question in its entirety.

“Mr. Thompson, this individual that came into the country—,” Noem started deflecting, before Thompson pressed again.

“No. I want to know who approved—” Thompson continued.

But Noem cut him off again. “No, no, no, no. I’m not going to let you—”

When Noem refused to stop talking, Thompson called to reclaim his time. Then the chairman of the committee, Representative Andrew Garbarino, got involved, ordering Noem to stop speaking until Thompson could ask his question again.

“Yes or no, who approved the asylum claim?” asked Thompson, but Noem again blamed the Biden administration.

“I don’t want to file perjury charges against you, but I’m of the opinion that the Trump administration—DHS, your DHS—approved the asylum application,” Thompson said.

It’s been two weeks since the shooting took place. In that time, Noem has repeatedly thwarted attempts to pin her agency for Lakanwal’s asylum, even though that’s actually what happened. Instead, she has nonsensically claimed that the Biden administration’s vetting process for Lakanwal, which began after he entered the U.S. in 2021, had effectively made her powerless to the ultimate decision regarding Lakanwal’s ability to stay in the country.

Prior to the shooting, there were plenty of well-documented reasons to allow Lakanwal into America. He operated as a foreign partner with America’s intelligence services in Afghanistan, and worked with the CIA as a partner in the country for more than a decade before U.S. troops withdrew from the region. Unfortunately, however, Lakanwal struggled with PTSD as a result of the war, his family told CNN.

He allegedly shot two members of West Virginia’s National Guard on the eve of Thanksgiving. U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, is “slowly healing,” according to his family.

The Trump administration might be exaggerating their employment figures, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday.

In a press conference, Powell said that staffers at the Fed think that the government could be overestimating the number of jobs created by 60,000 each month. With published figures stating that the U.S. has added an average of 40,000 jobs each month since April, the true numbers could be closer to a loss of 20,000 jobs a month.

“We think there’s an overstatement in these numbers,” Powell said at the conference, which followed a policy meeting at the central bank.

Much of the issue is how the Department of Labor counts jobs added or subtracted when new businesses are opened or others close shop. The government can’t easily reach out to companies just starting out, or that have gone out of business, so the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a statistical model to guess. In recent years, BLS numbers have overstated job creation, sometimes by hundreds of thousands of jobs a year, resulting in revisions showing less jobs later.

But the Trump administration has not responded well to bad jobs reports. When payroll processor ADP reported that the economy lost nearly 32,000 jobs in November, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick scrambled to blame Democrats and deflect blame from President Trump’s tariffs. Trump himself fired the BLS chief over the summer because he was mad about the negative jobs data the agency produced. It’s not outside of the realm of possibility that Trump would put pressure on the agency to fudge better numbers.

Venezuela has condemned the Trump administration’s Wednesday seizure of an oil tanker, calling it an “act of piracy.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the tanker of illegally sending oil to terrorist groups, justifying the administration’s hostile takeover.

“For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” she wrote Wednesday on X, along with a video of the seizure. “This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely—and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues.”

The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry offered a very different read of the situation.

“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela denounces and energetically repudiates what constitutes a brazen robbery and an act of international piracy, publicly announced by the President of the United States … making clear that the policy of aggression against our country responds to a deliberate plan to plunder our energy resources,” they wrote. “Under these circumstances, the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been exposed. It is not migration. It is not drug trafficking. It is not democracy. It is not human rights. It has always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people.”

President Trump seems to have fully embraced the piracy angle.

“What happens to the oil on the ship?” a reporter asked Trump Wednesday afternoon.

“Well we keep it, I guess,” Trump replied, before failing to answer where exactly the oil was originally going.

This is yet another ratcheting up of aggression against the Maduro government—and yet another example of the absolute disregard the Trump administration has for anyone else’s sovereignty but their own.",https://images.newrepublic.com/36c504e2faf37d41f18952d5680965920d9b0891.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-12 14:57:07.419976

As terrified congregants fled into the trees or hid inside, agents detained an El Salvadoran church member, deporting him ten days later and leaving behind his wife and adult children.

""It was a normal day,"" recalled Pastor Victor Ramirez. ""We heard the news about ICE, but we said, 'this is a safe place.' We were not doing anything; we are not criminals.""

The November incident was part of a broader enforcement sweep dubbed ""Operation Charlotte's Web,"" which has ignited a firestorm in Charlotte's vibrant immigrant community and raised a profound crisis for faith leaders: Can the government freely pursue immigration enforcement within the walls of a church?

The operation unfolded after a significant policy change. In January, the White House rescinded longstanding ""sensitive locations"" guidelines that had traditionally directed ICE to avoid enforcement at places like churches, schools, and hospitals.

This policy shift has empowered a wave of intensified enforcement actions in cities with large immigrant populations. While operations like Charlotte's are locally named, they reflect a concerted national strategy. ICE arrests in the interior of the U.S. have risen, and arrests at or near sensitive locations, once rare, have become a contentious focal point of fear and legal challenges from advocacy groups.

Federal agents launched Operation Charlotte's Web in November, aiming to target possible criminals in a metro area home to over 300,000 foreign-born residents. Officials reported apprehending upwards of 370 people.

""If we have known murderers and drug dealers, and really bad people – we want to get them out,"" said President Donald Trump during a recent press conference.

However, local pastors and attorneys describe the results as a ""shock and awe"" campaign that has spread fear far beyond its intended targets.

For Pastor Ramirez, the arrest at his church felt like a violation. It happened after a during a service project after a Saturday service, and the man detained and deported shared the message that day.

""I understand that ICE has to find criminals, I understand and agree with that,"" the pastor said, standing outside Casa de Dios. ""He's not a criminal. This is church.""

The impact has rippled far beyond a single arrest. Faith leaders report aggressive tactics that have frightened entire congregations. Many immigrant churches stopped holding services for weeks. According to local reports, some 30,000 children stayed home from school in the wake of the operations.

The dilemma is acutely felt by pastors like Dan Titan of Casa Viva Church on Charlotte's east side, who leads a congregation of about a thousand, mostly Latino immigrants.

""Yeah, I can't lie. There are people without some papers, of course,"" Pastor Titan acknowledged. ""We are the church. We are the body of Christ. We are Christian, and we need to obey the law. We are not against the law. But within there's different ways to do the law, you know.""

He went on to confirm the pervasive fear: ""They were scared. That's for sure… There's still people just in their homes.""

Confrontations like these are shifting from sanctuaries and public spaces into the courtroom. Attorney Anna Cushman of Tedesco Legal, who works with detainees, argues that in church-site detentions, the operations threaten a fundamental right.

""I first think about the Constitution, protecting the free exercise of religion,"" Cushman said. ""There's not an exception there that says you get to exercise your religion, so long as you don't get in the way of immigration enforcement. There is no exception there.""

For Cushman, a Christian, the issue is also a matter of faith. ""What's going on is that we are not welcoming the stranger. We are not treating the least of these as if they are Jesus,"" she said. ""We are called to this kind of radical hospitality.""

As the operation took root, a coordinated network of citizens sprang up in opposition. Non-profits, local churches, and neighbors organized protests, blew whistles to warn of approaching agents, and handed out ""Know Your Rights"" flyers. Volunteers delivered food to families too afraid to leave their homes.

""We don't need ICE coming into Charlotte disrupting our city, creating fear in our city and work space,"" said Niecy Brown of the North Carolina AFL-CIO at a press briefing.

Charlotte City Council Member-elect JD Mazuera Arias held a similar disposition: ""This is not about public safety. It is not about finding criminals. It's about fear, quotas, and it's about control.""

The rallying cry has been organized around a central message: that loving your neighbor isn't just the right thing to do—it's holy.

ICE declined CBN News' request for an interview. In a statement, the agency said its actions in Charlotte were ""lawful and targeted threats to public safety.""

As the legal and political battles continue, the human and spiritual cost remains forefront for leaders like Pastor Ramirez. In a final plea to Washington, he asked for compassion.

""We pray for {President Trump},"" Ramirez said. ""All we ask for is some mercy because people who attend our church… they're not criminals. We serve a purpose – a purpose of the Lord. That's why we are here.""

The nation is left to navigate the intersection of faith, law, and community, where the principle of sanctuary now hinges on judicial interpretation and political will.",https://cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/bca1420icechurchcharlotte02_hdv.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 12:57:59.141180

Not long after the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, DC, Elora Mukherjee found herself contacting her clients with bad news. Mukherjee, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, needed to tell several asylum seekers that their applications had been put on hold—indefinitely.

Many of them had been “eagerly waiting for years to have an interview” in their cases, Mukherjee said. They hoped to finally be allowed to stay in the United States and freed from the fear of deportation, she said. But this pause “shattered” their “sense of safety and hope.”

In response to the attack—in which an Afghan immigrant has been charged with killing US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and wounding Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe—the Trump administration moved fast, stopping the issuance of visas and asylum for nationals of Afghanistan. Then, it went a step further: indefinitely halting all asylum decisions, regardless of nationality, “pending a comprehensive review.” The Trump administration also paused the processing of immigration benefits for people from 19 countries targeted by the June travel ban.

The sweeping change in policy, legal experts and advocates say, is disproportionate. It punishes the collective for the wrongdoings of one troubled individual. The blanket restrictions are also likely to have a far broader impact beyond the groups and countries singled out by the White House. “These actions are basically shutting down the legal immigration system,” Shev Dalal-Dheini, government relations director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said during a briefing with reporters.

“These are not narrow, targeted shifts,” AILA’s executive director Ben Johnson said, adding that the “ripple effects” of these actions would be felt by millions of people and entire communities across the country. “These policies don’t just disrupt paperwork,” he said, “they derail lives.”

In the aftermath of the shooting, immigration lawyers have reported naturalization ceremonies and green card interviews getting canceled. Cases in which the applicant had already been interviewed, and sometimes approved, have also been paused.

Even immigrants who hold a passport from a non-banned nation—say a dual citizen of Iran and Canada—are impacted if their country of birth is one of the 19 placed on the travel ban. The list at the moment includes Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also indicated it might grow to more than 30 nations.

The abrupt changes have sewn fear and put families in limbo. They have also increased the odds that people who were pursuing legal status—and had been previously vetted—might now end up in the crosshairs of immigration enforcement.

Mukherjee said she has urged her clients to take every possible precaution. But it’s a Catch-22. Complying with immigration enforcement requirements risks arrest at check-in; not complying could make you a target for not following the rules.

Last week, one of her clients, an Afghan asylum seeker, showed up to immigration court in New York City for a required routine appointment only to be separated from his lawyer, taken into custody, and sent to a detention center in New Jersey.

“It’s shocking that he was arrested and detained when he was doing exactly what he was supposed to do,” Mukherjee said, explaining that the man had been paroled into the United States and had no criminal history. Writing in a recent New York Times op-ed, Mukherjee described how asylum seekers she works with and who fear persecution in their countries of origin are “gripped with terror,” unsure of whether they’ll be allowed to stay in the United States.

“Unfortunately, if you’re from Iran, Venezuela, or Afghanistan and you’ve gone through the process, now you’re put on hold, your citizenship interview is canceled…because some guy decided to do something illegal and unconscionable—shooting other people,” said Minneapolis-based attorney Paschal Nwokocha. “A big segment of our immigrant population is now having to pay because of the sin of one person.”

Prior to the shooting, the Trump administration had already ordered a review of Biden-era grants of refugee status. Now, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency in charge of visas and other immigration benefits, has announced it will conduct a “full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”

Immigration lawyers warn that revisiting hundreds of thousands of approved cases will burden the agency and slow down the processing of all applications, leading to even bigger backlogs, longer wait times, and potential gaps in benefits that could jeopardize people’s employment. (In many instances these are people who have been thoroughly vetted multiple times over the years.)

It also means that already-limited resources are being moved away from the adjudication and investigation of cases of actual fraud or that pose potential threat.

“There’s a larger plan at work here,” Johnson said. “This is about throwing sand in the gears of the entire immigration system in order to end immigration.”

The day after the D.C. shooting, USCIS also announced “additional national security measures,” including a new guidance that instructs officers to consider “country-specific factors as significant negative factors” when considering cases of people from the 19 countries on the travel ban. These arbitrary assessments on the basis of nationality, immigration experts say, could lead to more denials and leave little room for judicial review because the courts have given the government large deference when it comes to discretionary decisions by an immigration agency.

Another unintended consequence of the changes might be a chilling effect that discourages immigrants from coming forward to engage with the legal system, pushing them into the shadows.

On Thursday, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit against Senate Bill 17, a new law that restricts people with citizenship, permanent residence or political ties to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from acquiring most types of real estate in Texas, including farmland, homes and commercial property.

Supporters say the measure is a safeguard against national security threats repeatedly highlighted in the federal government's annual threat assessment.

The plaintiff in the case, Peng Wang, is a Chinese citizen who's lived in Texas for 16 years on a student visa. Wang argued that the law discriminated against him and others like him, making it harder to rent long term or eventually buy a home.

But the appeals court on Wednesday ruled that SB 17 doesn't apply to Wang at all. To fall under the law, someone must be domiciled in a designated country, meaning that country is their permanent home. The judges noted that Wang considers Texas his home, plans to stay after school and has ""no real plans to return to China.""

""Wang is asking this court to find that his true, fixed, and permanent home and place to which he intends to return is an unknown place somewhere in China at which he has never lived and to which he has no intention to ever return,"" the ruling read. ""We refuse the invitation.""

Because Wang didn't meet those requirements, the court refused to move forward on the bigger constitutional questions, leaving SB 17 fully in effect.

Justin Sadowsky, legal director at the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance and Wang's attorney, said he was disappointed in the decision, but believed future legal challenges would be taken against what he described as a ""blatantly discriminatory law.""

JB Pritzker signed a bill limiting federal immigration enforcement into law Tuesday morning, over a month after House Bill 1312 passed the state legislature on Oct. 31. Dubbed the Safety and Liberation Together Act, it restricts federal immigration enforcement near state courthouses and allows individuals to pursue litigation over civil immigration enforcement actions.

In the wake of Operation Midway Blitz, the SALT Act is Democratic Illinois lawmakers’ response to increased federal immigration enforcement in Chicago and its suburbs. The last several months have seen the arrests of thousands, largely without criminal records, according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement published by the Deportation Data Project.

Under the legislation’s provisions, people taken into custody can sue for civil damages, including statutory damages of $10,000. Apart from state courthouses, it also strengthens immigration protection and privacy policies for places like hospitals, universities and day care centers.

“Together we’re sending a message to Donald Trump, to Kristi Noem, to Gregory Bovino and anyone else seeking to terrorize our people,” Pritzker said at a Tuesday morning news conference. “Your divisiveness and your brutality are not welcome here.”

Damages for those seeking legal remedies may increase based on the defendant’s conduct, including factors such as facial coverings, body cameras, crowd control measures — including the use of tear gas — and vehicles with a non-Illinois license plate or no license plate at all.

In a written statement to The Daily, State Sen. Mike Simmons (D-Chicago) described these locations as places where “people’s safety is of the utmost importance” and described ICE agents’ actions in Chicago and its suburbs as “sickening” and demonstrating a “reckless disregard for the law and violence.”

In Springfield, the bill cleared the Senate with a 40-18 vote and the House with a 75-32 vote, supported by Democratic lawmakers including Simmons, State Rep. Hoan Huynh (D-Chicago) and State Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview).

According to Simmons, his support for the bill was a reaction to fears that his constituents have shared with him and his experience seeing ICE agents “throw” a reporter to the ground in Lincoln Square and people “abducted” from Rogers Park.

Many of his constituents still will not leave their homes without passports, Simmons wrote, and some fear going to school, work or grocery shopping.

“Even since this bill passed last month, that fear is still real for many of the families I represent, and we need a real reckoning with the damage and trauma ICE has left behind,” Simmons wrote.

Pritzker lauded the “hundreds of everyday Illinoisans” who have taken up rapid-response responsibilities and “answered the call of neighbors in need.” He added that the state’s rapid responder system is “nation-leading” and people in other cities are following Illinois’ example.

Fine wrote in a statement to The Daily that since ICE began “raiding” neighborhoods earlier this year, she could tell from her conversations with constituents that they were willing to do everything in their power to protect and provide for their neighbors.

Immigrants in the 9th District aren’t just “numbers on an ICE spreadsheet,” Fine emphasized. Some are parents taking their kids to daycare and families trying to put food on the table; others, students on community college campuses, she wrote.

“My district made it unmistakably clear that they wanted their state government to step up, and HB 1312 is the direct result of those conversations,” Fine wrote.

However, the bill has faced backlash from Republicans, including State Sen. John Curran (R-Lemont), who argued in the chamber that it would get “set aside” by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights Executive Director Lawrence Benito said in a Tuesday news release that Illinois residents have “stepped up to look out for their neighbors” and demanded “real protections.”

U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston) wrote in a statement to The Daily that Pritzker was doing “exactly what a leader should do in the face of a wannabe dictator’s cruel policies.” The new law will assuage fears about going to court or seeking medical care and basic services, regardless of immigration status, she added.

Schakowsky shared that she’s heard from families across the 9th District who are “afraid to even step outside” after ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents “terrorized” their communities.

“Everyone, regardless of their immigration status, deserves to live with dignity and without fear,” Schakowsky wrote.

Mayor Daniel Biss thanked the legislation’s advocates and applauded Pritzker for signing it into law in a statement to The Daily.

He highlighted the strengthening of data protections and prohibiting courthouse arrests as terms that hold ICE accountable.

“These state protections bolster the actions we’ve taken in Evanston to help keep people safe,” Biss wrote. “While the amount of federal activity has decreased in recent weeks, I urge all residents to remain vigilant and look out for our neighbors as ICE has been spotted in the Chicagoland area in recent weeks.”

In early October, Fernando Gomez Ruiz was eating at a food truck in Los Angeles when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents grabbed him. The 61-year-old was taken from the city where he had lived for 22 years. He was brought to California City Detention Facility, where he says he was denied insulin. Soon, his blood sugar spiked. An ulcer spread across his foot. It’s still there today; he tries to clean the oozing blood as best he can with dirty, bloody gauze. But because of the way the facility restricts legal calls, he hasn’t been able to fully explain any of this to his lawyer. This denial of one of the most basic rights in America, the ability to speak with an attorney, has became an instrument of the ICE detention system itself.

Attorney-client privilege is the oldest privilege in American law. “It is a sacrosanct privilege,” said Eunice Cho, senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project. “For people in government custody, it is quite important to be able to speak with attorneys in a privileged, confidential manner.”

ICE insists its system protects attorney-client privilege. Every detention facility is supposed to follow ICE standards that promise private meeting rooms, unmonitored legal calls, and secure legal mail. But the record inside tells a different story.

In the past year, class-action lawsuits from California to New York to Florida have asked federal courts to intervene because ICE facilities monitored legal calls, copied privileged mail, and denied access to attorneys. Taken together, these filings depict a system where confidential communication with an attorney is structurally impossible.

Earlier this month, Gomez Ruiz and six others sued California City Detention Facility for denying access to counsel, among other violations. Their case lays bare a broader pattern that starts the moment someone is detained. Attorneys often cannot find their people for days because ICE’s Online Detainee Locator System is delayed and sometimes does not list them at all. Families are left calling hospitals trying to learn where their loved one is. Once someone is found, confidential communication is almost impossible.

Attorneys describe weekslong delays for legal calls. When virtual calls do occur, they are capped at one hour, which means detainees may wait another week or two before speaking to counsel again. Tablets, which allow people in California’s state prisons to make calls from their cells, are only allowed in dayrooms. And in many ICE facilities, the tablets that are intended to be used with legal representatives are monitored and recorded. Even in-person “confidential” conversations take place under guard surveillance in crowded rooms where the sound carries.

Marisol Dominguez-Ruiz, one of Fernando’s lawyers from the ACLU, is used to sitting in the same room as her clients without barriers. But at California City, she was forced to bend forward to talk with Fernando through a small sliver between the glass. “You’re kind of crouched down and yelling to make sure that each other hears,” she said. “It doesn’t sound to me like it’s a confidential kind of conversation.”

Immigrants in ICE custody are trapped in a paradox. They have no Sixth Amendment right to an attorney—that applies only to criminal defendants. But an attorney is often their only “contact with the outside world,” and only hope of reaching their family members, as a federal judge underscored in 2019. In that case, the court held that the government cannot make it harder for an immigrant detainee to exercise their right to counsel, and that doing so could violate their First Amendment right to communicate with the outside world. The stakes are clear: Without a lawyer, people are twice as likely to be deported, according to a study earlier this year from the American Immigration Council.

“Arguably immigrants in civil detention should have at least as good if not better access to their attorneys than people in criminal custody,” said Emma Winger, deputy legal director at the American Immigration Council.

Because they are civil detainees in immigration court, there is no mechanism for courts to rapidly intervene when their rights collapse. In a criminal case, if a jail interferes with attorney-client conversations, you can go straight to federal court and get a judge to stop it. Immigration law works the opposite way. People must wait until they lose their case, then file an appeal, and then and only then ask a federal court to review what happened. “Any claims that come out of someone’s deportation proceedings can only be raised on a petition for review of their removal order,” said Winger. “It makes it more difficult to quickly prevent ongoing abuses in the deportation process by bringing a lawsuit in federal court.”

What exists is a system that treats people worse than criminal punishment while it uses its civil label to evade the constitutional limits that govern punishment. That’s nothing new. ICE has been warned about attorney access violations for more than two decades. A 2006 report by DHS found that detainees in multiple ICE facilities had to make legal calls from dayrooms or offices without privacy panels where staff could overhear them, and that some facilities delayed or denied requests for attorney calls for more than two weeks. Six years later, the American Immigration Council found that ICE restricts access to attorneys and that agents were telling people they aren’t entitled to one. Most recently, in 2022, the ACLU’s No Fighting Chance report found that at least 58 (out of 199 at the time) ICE facilities block attorney calls, provide no private space for meetings, and create delays that cause attorneys to miss critical deadlines.

What’s new is the scale: The Trump administration has demanded more than 1 million deportations. To reach that quota, “ICE wants people to self-deport,” said Amy Godshall, an ACLU of Florida attorney. Without a lawyer, people may feel they have little hope of contesting their case and may want to escape the horrifying conditions of detention at all costs, even if that means leaving the country.

At facilities like Broadview in Illinois, detainees say officers have been asking them to sign ICE Form I-210—a “voluntary departure” order—that is completed by officers themselves. “People are signing these life-altering documents without the benefit of talking to counsel,” said Cho.

More than a series of isolated violations, this is a structural design. Civil detention erases the attorney-client privilege at the core of due process and then uses that void to pressure people into signing their own deportation orders. The machinery works because people are made to disappear before they ever get to speak.",https://compote.slate.com/images/e0ccfddb-251f-4479-9083-b704e5160a9a.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-12-12 12:58:20.737898

That’s why we have serious concerns about Bill C-9.
But Bill C-9, without amendment, will not do that.","The CLC condemns all forms of hate, discrimination, and harassment. We will continue to fight for the rights that make Canada a free and democratic country.

This is why we, alongside civil liberties organizations, oppose the current version of Bill C-9, the Combatting Hate Act.

The version of the Bill being debated in the House of Commons has the potential to infringe on our hard fought-for rights of freedom of expression and freedom of association with little to no oversight.

Parliament should not pass this Bill without considerable amendment. As drafted, the Bill threatens labour rights, fundamental freedoms, the right to protest, and public accountability.

With Bill C-9, the federal government proposes to create three new offenses: a hate crime offense, an offense of willfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group, and an intimidation offense.

Canada already has criminal offences in place to combat hate like mischief, intimidation, and harassment. Police currently have the “ancillary powers” to create exclusion zones for protests, which has the potential to limit freedom of expression and our right to peaceful protest. Three Canadian cities (Toronto, Vaughn, and Ottawa) have created bubble zone bylaws, aimed to protect identifiable groups from hate and harassment when accessing health care (abortion clinics), and attending school and places of worship.

More mirroring legislation and additional powers given to law enforcement is not necessary.

We need to protect the fundamental rights that allow Canadians to participate fully in our society and to voice dissent without fear. In today’s political climate, defending these core freedoms is more important than ever.

This legislation comes at a moment when we are witnessing alarming rights violations in the United States. The National Guard is being deployed to cities to target and deport immigrants under the guise of combating crime. The U.S. Department of Justice and ICE have arrested, charged, and prosecuted protesters for speaking out against immigration raids and for participating in Palestinian solidarity demonstrations. The Trump administration continues to single out vulnerable communities — including trans people and immigrants — while actively eroding core First Amendment rights.

We cannot allow fundamental rights to be weakened or undermined in Canada. We must ensure that every person here can participate fully in society and speak out without fear.

We have already witnessed these trends in American governance creep across the border. Since Trump’s inauguration, we have experienced a significant and frightening tariff war, pressure to concede to US demands, and a push to increase border security and crack down on migrants and refugees.

That’s why we have serious concerns about Bill C-9. Without amendment, it will undermine core democratic rights and expand state powers in ways that put workers and marginalized communities at risk.

Bill C-9 makes it easier for the state to prosecute people by expanding discretionary police powers and removing the requirement for the Attorney General’s consent. Without amendment, it will lower the bar for criminal charges and give law enforcement wide authority with little oversight.

This opens the door to the criminalization of peaceful protest and collective action. Without amendment, it will disproportionately impact Indigenous, Black, and racialized communities.

For workers, the threat is clear. The Charter protects the right to strike — yet without amendment, Bill C-9 will erode this right, making certain legal job actions a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. This is a direct attack on organized labour and freedom of association.

The Bill’s broad and vague language compounds these risks. Without amendment, it will grant sweeping powers without accountability, putting free expression, peaceful assembly, and democratic participation in danger.

We all want to stop hate crimes and keep people safe in their communities. But Bill C-9, without amendment, will not do that. Instead, it will weaken the very freedoms that keep people safe — the right to speak out, to organize, and to participate fully in society.

We pushed back hard against U.S. tariffs. We must bring that same resolve to opposing legislation that, without amendment, will chip away at our rights here at home.",https://canadianlabour.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parliament.Statement.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:56:59.706148

Large-scale migration from Latin America started in the 1960s.
There has been a significant increase in migration to the United States from all over the world since 2020, but the spike is especially notable for Latin America.
For example, he removed temporary protections from 600,000 Venezuelans who were previously allowed to live and work in the United States.
Brazil, for example, faces a 50% levy on its exports to the United States, although many products are exempt.","In his first year in office, Donald Trump has ramped up the US's military presence in Latin America, personally involved himself in national elections, pressed regional leaders on migration, designated drug cartels as terrorist groups and disrupted trade relations with an aggressive tariff policy.

The new US National Security Strategy states that the government ""will assert and enforce a 'Trump Corollary' to the Monroe Doctrine"" — referring to the 1823 declaration by President James Monroe that the United States should have hegemony over the Western Hemisphere and the American continent.

To better understand the relationship between the United States and its southern neighbors, here are seven charts providing context on recent trends on migration, security, geopolitics and trade.

1. Migration: Latin Americans are 50% of migrants in the US and make up over 90% of the people deported

More than 50 million of the 340 million inhabitants of the United States were born abroad, according to annual data published by the US Census Bureau. About 25 million came from Latin America and the Caribbean.

At more than 11 million, Mexicans are the largest group of Latin American migrants to the United States. With about 1.7 million migrants in the US, Cuba is a distant second, followed by El Salvador with 1.5 million.

Large-scale migration from Latin America started in the 1960s. There has been a significant increase in migration to the United States from all over the world since 2020, but the spike is especially notable for Latin America. Venezuela and Colombia are among the primary places of origin for this more recent group of migrants, according to the Pew Research Center, which makes projections based on monthly survey data.

Trump launched his 2015 presidential campaign by associating migration from Mexico with drugs, rape and other crimes. Ten years later, he employs the same rhetoric, saying, for example, that Venezuela's government deliberately released criminals from jail and sent them to the United States — a claim for which there is no evidence.

Along with continuing to employ the inflammatory language, Trump has taken steps to fulfill his announced plans of mass deportation. For example, he removed temporary protections from 600,000 Venezuelans who were previously allowed to live and work in the United States.

Even before Trump took office, people from Latin America were the overwhelming majority of migrants removed from the United States by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

2. Security: Trump is officially designating Latin American cartels as terrorist organizations

Trump's association of Latin American countries with drug trafficking and criminality has expanded to a broader geopolitical stance. To justify airstrikes on boats allegedly carrying drugs in Latin American seas, Trump has claimed that the United States is at war with terror groups.

In 2025 alone, the United States has designated 24 new groups as Foreign Terror Organizations (FTOs) — a legal classification that allows the US to seize assets and prosecute people alleged to have ties with them. Of those, 14 are Latin American drug cartels and criminal gangs such as the Cartel de Sinaloa, from Mexico, and Tren de Aragua, from Venezuela.

Before Trump, only eight organizations from Latin America had ever been designated as such. They were all left-wing guerrilla groups, such as Peru's Sendero Luminoso and Colombia's Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional.

The shift toward listing cartels and crime syndicates as terror organizations is unprecedented. No previous State Department briefs since 1997 reviewed by DW mention drug trafficking and criminal activities as justifications for inclusion in the FTO list. The vast majority of pre-Trump designations were for terror groups from Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia.

In an analysis published in Foreign Policy magazine, Tricia Bacon and Daniel Byman, professors at the American University and Georgetown University, respectively, write that these designations can increase tensions with the governments of countries where the cartels operate. ""By switching the narrative from crime to terrorism, there is an implication that these governments are knowingly harboring terrorists, a far more damning charge than simply having ties to criminal organizations,"" they write.

The designations do not legally authorize the use of military force. ""Politically, labeling a group 'terrorists' may help justify military action and play better to U.S. audiences, but an FTO designation, by itself, does not provide expanded authorities,"" they add.

3. Geopolitics: Trump is continuing the US tradition of interfering in Latin American politics. His openness about it might be new, but the practice is not.

Trump started his presidency by vowing to retake the Panama Canal and renaming the Gulf of Mexico the ""Gulf of America"" within the United States. In August 2025, he increased tariffs on Brazilian imports in a failed effort to prevent Brazil's Supreme Court from convicting far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro on several charges, including plotting a coup and attempting to abolish the democratic rule of law.

As Argentina prepared to vote in legislative elections in October, Trump tied a $20 billion (€17.2 billion) loan to the success of President Javier Milei's far-right coalition — which some have credited with helping the bloc secure the most votes. He even sent the world's largest aircraft carrier to the Caribbean Sea, threatening Venezuela's strongman leader, Nicolas Maduro, and has not ruled out invading the country altogether.

For many, these actions are evocative of the US's Cold War-era interventions in Latin America, either with direct, open military action or with covert plans such as supporting allied groups, attempting assassinations and influencing elections.

In her book, ""Covert Regime Change: America's Secret Cold War,"" Lindsey O'Rourke, a political science professor at Boston College, has identified 23 instances in which the United States tried to topple governments in Latin America from 1949 through 1989. They include covertly supporting coups against elected leaders in Chile and Brazil, repeatedly trying to assassinate Cuba's Fidel Castro, and invading Panama to oust dictator (and former ally) Manuel Noriega.

According to O'Rourke's work, those actions were not exclusive to the Cold War, but part of a centurylong geopolitical strategy of asserting dominance in the Western Hemisphere. They often resulted in increased political instability in the targeted countries.

Marco Rubio, Trump's secretary of state, claims that US foreign policy had overlooked its neighbors in recent years. Now, he says, the United States will focus on working with Latin American governments to secure borders and deter what he describes as a migrant invasion. ""Some countries are cooperating with us enthusiastically — others, less so. The former will be rewarded,"" he wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal in January, shortly before he embarked on his first official trip to Central America in February. ""As for the latter, Mr. Trump has already shown that he is more than willing to use America’s considerable leverage to protect our interests.""

4. Trade: The US is no longer the undisputed trade leader in the Americas

The most recent data from UN Comtrade, a United Nations platform that tracks global commerce flows, shows that the United States is still the largest commercial partner of Latin American countries, but is no longer as dominant as in the past.

In 2024, the United States was the source of about 29% of overall imports for countries in Latin America — down from roughly 50% in 2000. Currently, the United States is the destination for 45% of Latin American exports, down from 59% in 2000.

Latin America's dependence on US markets varies from country to country. Though some countries, such as Mexico, still rely heavily on the United States as their main commercial partner, many have been looking elsewhere.

Simultaneously, trade ties with China increased across Latin America. By 2024, the Asian superpower was the main trade partner of Brazil, Peru, Chile and Bolivia.

Trump's tariff policy has hit some countries directly. Brazil, for example, faces a 50% levy on its exports to the United States, although many products are exempt. Mexico is currently negotiating to avoid the imposition of a 25% tariff. Additional charges on goods such as copper and steel could hit other economies as well.

""We'll have to seek other partners to buy our products,"" Brazilian President Lula da Silva said when the tariff was first announced in July. ""It's not like we can't survive without the United States. If the United States doesn't want to buy, we will find someone who wants to.""

You reject checks and balances, and you ignore Congress and the courts,” Ramirez told Noem Thursday.
“Absolutely.” Ramirez shot back that Noem violated court orders by not turning around deportation flights bound for El Savador, despite a court order.
Noem also said she would meet with Ramirez, after Ramirez cited several instances in which she requested a meeting with her, including during an Oct. 3 visit to Chicago.
“Federal law enforcement agents actually have a legal duty to intervene to prevent a fellow officer from using excessive force.","U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez and Sen. Tammy Duckworth went face-to-face with top Trump administration officials in separate Washington hearings Thursday, with Ramirez calling for an investigation into Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s “potentially impeachable actions” and repeatedly calling her a liar.

“Secretary Noem, you lie and you lie to the American people,” Ramirez, whose 3rd Congressional District covers Chicago and parts of Cook and DuPage counties, told the House Homeland Security Committee after playing a clip of Noem saying “No Americans have been arrested or detained — we focus on those who are here illegally.”

Ramirez cited a ProPublica story that reported more than 170 U.S. citizens have been held by immigration agents. And she accused Noem of “smiling” during her questioning.

“There’s nothing smiling about U.S. citizens,” Ramirez said. “I’m sorry that’s very inappropriate. ... They’ve been dragged and detained for days.”

Ramirez penned a letter Wednesday that asked House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and ranking member Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, “to conduct a complete investigation into Secretary Noem’s “unlawful and potentially impeachable actions.” Her office called it “the first steps” toward impeaching Noem.

“Bottom line: You lie with impunity. You reject checks and balances, and you ignore Congress and the courts,” Ramirez told Noem Thursday. “Either you’re going to resign, Trump’s going to fire you or you will be impeached. I’ve already called for your resignation ... and I urge you to reconsider resignation because I’ve taken the first step toward your impeachment, and I’ve called on the Judiciary Committee to open an investigation into your lawlessness.”

Ramirez’s back-and-forth with Noem featured limited actual questions for her, although the congresswoman asked the secretary whether it was her “obligation as a member of the executive branch to honor decisions made by the highest court of land.”

“We are abiding by all federal judges’ orders,” Noem said. “Absolutely.”

Ramirez shot back that Noem violated court orders by not turning around deportation flights bound for El Savador, despite a court order.

Noem also said she would meet with Ramirez, after Ramirez cited several instances in which she requested a meeting with her, including during an Oct. 3 visit to Chicago.

A spokesperson for Jordan called Ramirez’s letter requesting an investigation into Noem, “the most ridiculous and toothless correspondence ever written,” signaling the request is unlikely to go anywhere.

Earlier in the hearing, Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., asked Noem why she “misled” the American public in saying U.S. citizens aren’t being arrested or detained, despite the at least 170 reported cases.

“Are you lying to the American people right now by denying these reports? Thanedar said.

“When we are doing our targeted enforcement operations against criminal illegal aliens, individuals that are in that area may be detained until we verify who they are, and then they are released,” Noem said. “This has been done for years, and every single law enforcement operation, that has always happened.”

Noem also said they have “never once detained or deported an American citizen,” as Thanedar interrupted to say, “Not true.”

Meanwhile, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Duckworth questioned Defense Department leaders on Trump’s domestic deployments of U.S. military troop. The Illinois senator secured the hearing in early October shortly after she blocked expedited passage of the National Defense Authorization Act until the hearing was secured.

“Let me tell you what is happening in Chicago. It is not ICE agents that are being attacked. ICE agents are the ones who tear-gas over two dozen Chicago police officers. ICE agents are the ones who tear-gas toddlers,” Duckworth said. “They are the ones pointing loaded weapons at unarmed bystanders, hauling preschool teachers from day care in front of their kids and rappelling from DHS helicopters onto apartment buildings in the dead of night to rip families from their beds and detain them for hours and then when they go to court, had to admit that they have no basis to file any charges. ... That is the terror that is happening in Chicago.”

Duckworth asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel for the Defense Department, whether National Guard members would be granted legal protection if they intervene to stop a federal agent from wrongfully harming a civilian.

Young said the Justice Department would handle the case based on recommendations from the Defense Department.

“The presumption is that our troops will act lawfully,” Young said.

“OK, listen, this is a straightforward answer, and the fact that it isn’t to you is deeply concerning to me,” Duckworth said. “Federal law enforcement agents actually have a legal duty to intervene to prevent a fellow officer from using excessive force.

“Uniformed service members on the other hand, have no comparable obligations, nor accompanying legal protections if they decide to intervene against a federal agent to protect a civilian. They do so at their own risk. ... I fear the day when Americans stop thanking our troops for their service because they’re afraid of our troops.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/42227fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5534x3159+0+265/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2F17%2Ffb78e1bc4b7582f9f268031b61ce%2Fap25345665901504.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 14:57:12.217882

Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown earlier this year when he was wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. He was last taken into custody in August during a similar check-in.

He's scheduled to appear in the morning at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore.

The agency freed him just before 5 p.m. on Thursday in response to a ruling from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland, who wrote federal authorities detained him after his return to the United States without any legal basis.

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under ICE supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump’s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked a federal judge there to dismiss them.

The 2019 settlement found he had a “well founded fear” of danger in El Salvador if he was deported there. So instead ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. Abrego Garcia has sued, claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish him for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” Xinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.

ICE freed Abrego Garcia from Moshannon Valley Processing Center, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, on Thursday just before the deadline Xinis gave the government to provide an update on Abrego Garcia's release.

He returned home to Maryland a few hours later.

Check-ins are how ICE keeps track of some people who are released by the government to pursue asylum or other immigration cases as they make their way through a backlogged court system. The appointments were once routine but many people have been detained at their check-ins since the start of President Donald Trump's second term.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said he’s prepared to defend his client against further deportation efforts.

“The government still has plenty of tools in their toolbox, plenty of tricks up their sleeve,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said, adding he fully expects the government to again take steps to deport his client. “We’re going to be there to fight to make sure there is a fair trial.”

The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized Xinis' order and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.

“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the judge made it clear that the government can’t detain someone indefinitely without legal authority and that his client “has endured more than anyone should ever have to.”

Abrego Garcia has also applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.

Abrego Garcia was hit with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling charges when the U.S. government brought him back from El Salvador. Prosecutors alleged he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling.

They went out to complete a task familiar to most Minnesotans: moving the car after a snowstorm.

After days of lying low, this task brought Gomez face-to-face with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, his family tells WCCO. They believe he was randomly targeted in an incident where ICE also restrained his teenage son, who later said he had an abnormal heartbeat thanks to the ordeal.

Jose sat down with WCCO alongside his mother, Karina. A family friend, Marion Vazquez, was there to help tell their story in English.

""She [Karina] thinks it's unfair that they treated her son in that manner, even put him in handcuffs, when he wasn't a threat,"" Vasquez said.

Jose said that he was in the car with his father when an unmarked SUV pulled up alongside them. When the police lights came on, he said that his dad told him to run as a second SUV arrived. Jose said that he was tackled, restrained and put into one of the cars operated by ICE. He said he was questioned about his legal status, but his dad argued that he was only a minor and couldn't respond.

Both Jose and Gomez are undocumented, originally from Mexico. But Karina said that to her knowledge, ICE did not have a warrant for Gomez's arrest. She believes he was instead profiled by ICE randomly patrolling the area; she was on the phone with Gomez at the time of the detainment, and she said she overheard ICE agents asking him for paperwork and citizenship.

Karina told the story through tears, holding their 20-day-old baby girl, the sole American citizen in the family. She said that Gomez first arrived in the United States about three years ago. She said that she and the kids joined last year, beginning the asylum-seeking process through the CBP One app established under the Biden administration. Karina said that back home in Mexico, criminals threatened her family with violence to extort money from them.

""She was even robbed at gunpoint at one point,"" Vasquez said. ""They were also just trying to get money off her.""

With Gomez still in ICE custody, 13-year-old Jose said that ICE was willing to drop him off at his aunt's house around the corner.

The family provided a video that they say shows the moments right after, with masked agents conferring with one another at the foot of the driveway.

Jose said that he then suffered from an abnormal heartbeat; he has an existing heart condition, and the stress from ICE detaining him and his father led him to need medical attention. The family showed WCCO documents indicating he received care at St. Francis Regional Medical Center. The documents list ""victim of assault and battery, chest wall pain,"" and abrasions of both wrists under ""diagnoses.""

Karina said that she doesn't know where her husband was taken, but knows that the family has now lost their sole provider.

The letter included 16 sworn declarations from detainees, detailing alleged excessive force, unsanitary living conditions, and delays in receiving medical care.

The groups also highlighted difficulties detainees face in contacting attorneys, citing long waits and limited phone access.

Advocates have expressed concerns about ""third country removals,"" claiming some detainees are pressured to enter Mexico despite not being from there.

Savanna Kumar from the ACLU described severe allegations of mistreatment, stating, ""Officers have crushed detained people's testicles, slammed people to the ground, stomped on them and punched their faces.""

Kumar added, ""The amount of violence that we have heard about officers using against detained people is creating a crisis situation.""

This week, ICE reported the death of a 48-year-old Guatemalan man detained at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced dead on Dec. 3, with medical staff attributing his death to natural causes related to liver and kidney failure.

ICE noted that the man had been hospitalized in September in Florida for medical treatment due to alcohol withdrawal.

Kumar commented on the death, saying, ""It raises serious concerns about whether Fort Bliss is on the brink of additional death, especially with the pattern of medical neglect and hospital visits that the detained people that we have spoke to have described to us.""

They say Dugan was following draft protocols sent by the chief judge which required her to refer ICE agents to a supervisor.","Jury selection is complete and a federal trial gets underway Monday for Milwaukee County judge Hannah Dugan. She is accused of helping a man try to evade arrest by immigration authorities at the county courthouse last April.

A grand jury indicted Dugan the following month. She faces one count of obstructing a proceeding, a felony, and another count of concealing an individual to prevent an arrest, a misdemeanor. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Dugan could face up to six years in prison if convicted.

Prosecutors offer their version of what happened

According to the criminal complaint, ICE agents wanted to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national, for being in the U.S. unlawfully. They determined he'd be appearing before Judge Dugan on April 18, on misdemeanor charges of domestic assault.

When agents showed up to arrest Flores-Ruiz, prosecutors say Dugan falsely told agents they needed a judicial warrant. They say she directed ICE agents to leave the hallway and go to the chief judge's office. She allegedly addressed Flores-Ruiz's case off the record while ICE agents were in the chief judge's office. She directed Flores-Ruiz and his counsel to leave the courtroom through a non-public jury door, and she told Flores-Ruiz's counsel that he could appear by Zoom at his next court date.

The court papers allege that Flores-Ruiz and his attorney ultimately ended up in the public hallway, where ICE agents saw them. Agents chased Flores-Ruiz outside and eventually caught him and arrested him. He has since been deported.

Defense attorneys say Dugan will be vindicated

NPR reached out to Judge Dugan and her attorneys, who declined to comment. However, before her arraignment, members of her defense team issued a statement: ""As she said after her unnecessary arrest, Judge Dugan asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court.""

Dugan's attorneys argue in court documents that court policy on immigration enforcement at the courthouse was in flux. They say Dugan was following draft protocols sent by the chief judge which required her to refer ICE agents to a supervisor.

Tony Cotton is a Wisconsin criminal defense attorney who is not involved in the case.

""If what she was doing was explaining to the agents that there's a different protocol that needs to be followed,"" says Cotton, ""and she was permitting the immigrant to use a different door, not to obstruct the police, but to reduce the confrontation in the courtroom, then it would bear on what her intent was.""

Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and current law professor at Loyola University, agrees. ""Really all this case is about is what was going on in the judge's head,"" Levenson says. ""Whether she was trying to conceal someone, whether she was trying to impede a proceeding, or whether she was trying to do what she thought was her job, run her courtroom, deal with her cases, and try to keep from having the Department of Homeland Security interfere with that.""

An unprecedented political context

Levenson says until President Trump's first term, courthouses were by and large off-limits to federal authorities, including immigration agents.

""There was this general understanding and respect that ICE could do their arrests, they could go to people's homes, they could take them off the streets, but the courthouses should not be disrupted for lots of reasons, because you don't want people not to come to their court proceedings,"" Levenson says.

A federal judge had ordered that immigration officials could not detain him.

Abrego Garcia appeared for the appointment at an ICE field office, some 14 hours after he was released from detention on a judge’s orders. His lawyers had asked the judge to block authorities from detaining him again and he walked out of the building surrounded by cheering supporters after the appearance, then left without commenting.

Officials cannot re-detain him until the court conducts a hearing on the motion for the temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland said. She wrote that Abrego Garcia is likely to succeed on the merits of any further request for relief from ICE detention.

“For the public to have any faith in the orderly administration of justice, the Court’s narrowly crafted remedy cannot be so quickly and easily upended without further briefing and consideration,” she wrote.

Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown earlier this year when he was wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. He was last taken into custody in August during a similar check-in.

Abrego Garcia on Friday stopped at a news conference outside the building, escorted by a group of supporters chanting “We are all Kilmar!”

Abrego Garcia says he’ll fight ‘against all of the injustices’

“I stand before you a free man and I want you to remember me this way, with my head held up high,” Abrego Garcia said through a translator. “I come here today with so much hope and I thank God who has been with me since the start with my family.”

He urged people to keep fighting.

“I stand here today with my head held high and I will continue to fight and stand firm against all of the injustices this government has done upon me,” Abrego Garcia said. “Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws and I believe that this injustice will come to an end.”

After Abrego Garcia spoke, he went through security at the field office, escorted by supporters.

When Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, announced to the crowd assembled outside that his client would walk back out the field office’s doors again, he stressed that the legal fight was not over.

“Yesterday’s order from Judge Xinis and now the temporary restraining order this morning represent a victory of law over power,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

The agency freed him just before 5 p.m. on Thursday in response to a ruling from Xinis, who wrote federal authorities detained him after his return to the United States without any legal basis.

Deported in error and then returned

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under ICE supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump’s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked a federal judge there to dismiss them.

A lawsuit to block removal from the U.S.

The 2019 settlement found he had a “well founded fear” of danger in El Salvador if he was deported there. So instead ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. Abrego Garcia has sued, claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish him for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” Xinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.

ICE freed Abrego Garcia from Moshannon Valley Processing Center, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, on Thursday just before the deadline Xinis gave the government to provide an update on Abrego Garcia's release.

He returned home to Maryland a few hours later.

Immigration check-in

Check-ins are how ICE keeps track of some people who are released by the government to pursue asylum or other immigration cases as they make their way through a backlogged court system. The appointments were once routine but many people have been detained at their check-ins since the start of President Donald Trump's second term.

Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said he’s prepared to defend his client against further deportation efforts.

“The government still has plenty of tools in their toolbox, plenty of tricks up their sleeve,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said, adding he fully expects the government to again take steps to deport his client. “We’re going to be there to fight to make sure there is a fair trial.”

The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized Xinis' order and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.

“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said the judge made it clear that the government can’t detain someone indefinitely without legal authority and that his client “has endured more than anyone should ever have to.”

Abrego Garcia has also applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.

Charges in Tennessee

Abrego Garcia was hit with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling charges when the U.S. government brought him back from El Salvador. Prosecutors alleged he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/12/kilmar-abrego-garcia-dec-12-2025.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=73px%2C0px%2C1127px%2C634px&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-12 11:57:10.054886

U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must let Abrego Garcia go immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.”

The Department of Homeland Security was highly critical of the release order and vowed to oppose it, calling it “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.

“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Messages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the order.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His lawsuit in federal court claims Trump’s Republican administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish Abrego Garcia over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court; “[t]hey affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The reference was made to the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia to and submitted affirmations that Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to accept him — later determined to be untrue.

“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.

Xinis also dismissed the federal government’s arguments that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a final order of removal, noting that order had not been filed.

“Thus, Abrego Garcia’s request for immediate release cannot touch upon the execution of a removal order if no such order exists,” she wrote.

Meanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States.

Additionally, Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.

His defense attorney in the Tennessee case, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.

A judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.”",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/12/KILMAR-GARCIA-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-12-12 10:57:49.173448

He said Wednesday that two of the arrests were made outside the courthouse in Keene, N.H.

Immigration enforcement traditionally has been a federal task, but an executive order President Donald Trump signed Jan. 20 requires that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorize state and local police to also participate.

The Troy Police Department is among a dozen law enforcement agencies in New Hampshire and 1,200 across the nation that have entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE.

The agreements are named for a section of immigration law that gives local and state police agencies the authority to perform immigration enforcement.

Critics of the 287(g) agreements say they lead to arrests without a lawful basis, erode trust in local law enforcement and waste money and time that would be better spent in the community rather than on federal civil immigration work.

Proponents say the pacts enhance public safety, expand the reach of immigration enforcement and can lead to the arrest of people who are not U.S. citizens and face criminal charges.

“I feel we’re doing something good,” Chief Ellis said in an interview Wednesday in his office.

Ellis said he’s happy to have immigrants who are here legally in the community but that wherever a person is from, “If you do something wrong, you have to answer for it.”

‘It could be anything’

Fernanda Marra Romeiro, an attorney with Celedon Law in Marlborough, Mass., represented one of the 13 people Troy police arrested.

Higo Davico Napoleao, 23, a construction worker from Brazil, was a passenger in a car that was being driven through Troy on Oct. 6 when police pulled it over on a speeding allegation, she said.

Napoleao was on his way home to Lowell, Mass., when police arrested him, Romeiro said. He then spent a month in federal custody until he was released following a bond hearing.

Romeiro said Napoleao, who has a valid work authorization card, has been in a years-long process of trying to become a permanent resident. In previous proceedings, the government had dropped a removal case against him because he had been classified as a special immigrant juvenile, she said.

That classification provides a potential pathway to permanent residency for some people under 21 who have been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents. Romeiro said Napoleao was also given deferred action status, which delays deportation.

She said her advice to people concerned about their immigration status is not to come to New Hampshire.

“People are being stopped for allegedly speeding, but it could be anything,” Romeiro said. “You could be involved in a motor vehicle accident and all of a sudden, there are police officers involved.

“So there are many different scenarios when you could be involved with law enforcement while crossing New Hampshire that could lead to immigration detention.”

ACLU objections

Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, said it is concerning when any police department enters into a 287(g) agreement.

He said that when local departments enforce immigration law, immigrants become less likely to communicate with police or seek help from them when they are a victim of crime.

Bissonnette said that once ICE detains someone, they can be held in custody for weeks or months until they can get a bond hearing.

“People are being picked up and detained regardless of whether they are a danger, regardless of whether they are a flight risk, regardless of whether they have committed a crime,” he said. “That person is being separated from their children, their partner, their parents. We should all imagine what it would be like if we were placed in that situation.

“That is what this regime is designed to do unfortunately — cause for these community members a sense of dread and terror.”

A key issue in a number of immigration cases is simply making sure the defendant has a day in court and a chance to be released on bond rather than being confined indefinitely, Bissonette said.

Courthouse sidewalk arrests

Cheshire County Sheriff Eli Rivera, whose agency provides security for the courthouse, said he was called by a constituent who was upset that one of his employees got picked up by Troy police outside the Keene building.

Rivera said this arrest, on Nov. 13, was the second time Troy police had taken someone into custody on the sidewalk outside the courthouse, with the other time coming a week earlier.

Rivera said such police activity may cause people to fear going to their court hearings.

“If anyone has something that brings them to court and they are not documented, now the fear will be, ‘Is ICE going to be outside the courthouse waiting for me, or is a local police agency working with ICE going to be waiting for me?’

“And that fear is going to travel real quick, like a wild brush fire.”

Rivera said he’s happy to work with federal law enforcement partners concerning people accused of violent crimes.

“I’d be the first person to bring them to ICE, because that’s the kind of behavior we’re trying to stop,” Rivera said.

On the other hand, he questions helping the federal agency apprehend someone for potential deportation when “they are just making a living here, trying to provide for the family and get a speeding ticket or something minor.”

Immigrant advocate

Former Democratic state Rep. Joe Schapiro of Keene is among a group of advocates for immigrants who have been meeting with law enforcement officials to discuss their 287(g) agreements.

He met with Ellis on Nov. 24.

“I think that there has been a national campaign to demonize and terrorize immigrants,” Schapiro said this week.

“I think there has been an alarming reduction in due process rights and constantly changing rules and regulation that have really been hurtful to immigrants and in turn has been hurtful to businesses that employ immigrants.”

Arrests explained

Ellis said he and two of his officers have been trained and certified to do immigration enforcement under his department’s agreement with ICE.

He said he has made 12 of the 13 arrests, mostly people just passing through town.

N.H. Route 12 goes through Troy. It is a primary route for people traveling between Boston and Keene and has a speed limit of 55 mph in some places, which drops to 30 mph in Troy.

“We stop a lot of cars,” Ellis said.

He said he or his officers inquire about immigration status during a traffic stop if they have a “reasonable suspicion” to do so. Not having a driver’s license could lead to such a suspicion, he said.

If necessary, they will check a person’s immigration status through a database.

If that search fails to find the person or determines that the person is in the country without proper immigration authorization, Ellis calls his ICE contact in Manchester to see if he should deliver them to federal custody in that city.

He has also brought people to the Strafford County jail in Dover, N.H., which has an agreement to hold ICE detainees. Ellis said another officer provides law enforcement coverage in Troy while he is on the road to Manchester or Dover.

Ellis said he “felt bad” during the first few arrests and sometimes still does, but feels people should go through proper immigration processes.

“They’re not bad guys,” he said, referring to the people he arrested.

Most did not appear to be facing issues beyond their immigration status, he noted, but he added that at least one had underlying charges of robbery and assault. He said about half of the 13 people arrested did not have a driver’s license.

Troy agreement

Ellis signed the 287(g) agreement with ICE in March. Under it, his police department is responsible for personnel expenses associated with the agreement, including overtime.

The chief said recent changes to the program should lead to ICE picking up overtime costs.

A Nov. 3 budget report posted on the town’s website showed that the police department, which has three full-time employees, had exceeded its $25,000 yearly overtime budget by about $2,200 or nearly 9%, with two months left in the year.

But when all of the police department’s operational expenses are considered, it was nearly 23% under its yearly budget of $576,608.

Selectboard watching

Richard H. Thackston III, a Troy selectman, said the Troy Police Department’s decision to participate in the agreement with ICE is not something that came before the selectboard.

“The real question is, is it draining resources from the day-to-day operations of Troy, and the answer is at this time, it does not appear to be,” he said.

Thackston said constituents haven’t called him with concerns about the local immigration enforcement.

He said he and other selectboard members are monitoring the issue.

“We’re conscious of it and we’re watching it,” Thackston said. “It’s certainly not a hard no, and it’s not a ‘Yee-haw, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,’ ‘’ Thackston said.

Most detainees ever

According to the nonprofit Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, there were a record 65,135 people in ICE detention as of Nov. 16, 73.6% of whom had no criminal convictions.

According to ICE statistics as of Nov. 10, it had 198 detainees in the Berlin Federal Correctional Institute and 140 at the Strafford County Department of Corrections in Dover.

The other 11 law enforcement agencies in New Hampshire with 287(g) agreements include State Police and sheriff’s offices in Grafton, Hillsborough, Rockingham and Belknap counties.

Also included are police departments in Candia, N.H., Carroll, N.H., Colebrook, N.H., Gorham, N.H., Ossipee N.H., and Pittsburg, N.H .

Immigration attorney Rolando Ruano expressed alarm about ICE agents operating inside the courthouse, describing the location as a place that should provide safety for people handling legal matters.

""This should be a sanctuary place where people can come and you know, take care of tickets or pay fines,"" Ruano said.

Ruano described the officers' tactics as calculated and discreet.

""They're doing it very sly, they have lookouts on both sides of the street. They pull up with a van and they just swiftly carry them in and then, you know, they're gone. They're dressed in in plain clothes,"" Ruano said.

Idaho News 6 obtained video of at least one man being detained in a courthouse stairwell moments after appearing in court. ICE confirmed to me that the men in the video are immigration officers, despite wearing plain clothes with no visible badges or agency attire.

The detentions have already created fear among Ruano's clients, forcing him to find alternative ways for them to comply with court requirements.

""I have already received a lot of calls from my current clients who are very afraid to come to court, so I have to scramble as an attorney and figure out what is the best way, you know, for them to still comply with their court hearings because if they don't, they get arrest warrants, right?""

The Canyon County Sheriff's Office confirmed that ICE notified them about plans to operate at the courthouse. While local deputies were not asked to assist, they indicated they would provide help if needed.

Canyon County Sheriffs Officers Statement:

""The Canyon County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) was advised Tuesday that agents with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations were present inside the Canyon County Courthouse. Courthouse security personnel with CCSO also confirmed their presence yesterday. CCSO was not asked to assist with or observe any enforcement activity and therefore cannot confirm whether any individuals were detained. ICE is fully authorized under federal law to conduct operations within the courthouse, and CCSO will not impede lawful federal actions. While CCSO does not and cannot enforce federal immigration law, we stand ready to provide limited support upon request from ICE to maintain a safe environment for all courthouse visitors and staff.""

Canyon County Sheriff's Office Statement

Attorneys are now exploring alternatives like Zoom hearings while waiting to learn whether ICE plans to return to the courthouse.

""We don't wanna alarm the community, but we do need to let them know what's happening,"" Ruano said.

PODER of Idaho, a local advocacy group, called the detentions ""deeply concerning,"" saying courthouse arrests create a ""chilling effect"" that discourages victims, witnesses, and families from appearing to resolve their cases.

PODER of Idaho's full statement:

""PODER of Idaho is deeply concerned by the reports that ICE agents detained community members at the Canyon County Courthouse immediately following their court hearings. Courthouses are meant to be places of justice, not traps for vulnerable residents seeking to resolve legal matters. When federal immigration enforcement targets people in or around courthouses, it creates a chilling effect—discouraging victims, witnesses, and families from showing up for their hearings out of fear.

This practice undermines public safety, strains trust in local institutions, and disproportionately harms immigrant families who are already navigating complex legal processes. We urge local officials to take action to ensure that everyone can access the courthouse without fear of detention, and we call on the community to continue reporting incidents so we can document and advocate for protections.

Our community deserves safety, dignity, and due process.""

Despite the concerns, Ruano urged people to continue fulfilling their legal obligations.

""Number 1, not to panic. Number 2, please show up to your court dates, because the consequences are much more dire if you don't,"" Ruano said.

Questions remain about how frequently ICE plans to operate at the courthouse and whether these detentions represent isolated incidents or part of broader immigration enforcement plans.

Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.

In New York, another Afghan asylum seeker was detained after complying with a request from immigration authorities to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. In northern California – home to one of the largest Afghan immigrant communities in the US – attorneys said nearly two dozen Afghan asylum seekers had been arrested – either out in the community, or at check-ins over the past two weeks.

Most of the Afghan asylum seekers who’ve been detained had requested asylum at the US-Mexico border over the last two years, attorneys said. Others have entered under Operation Allies Welcome – a Biden-era program to help resettle Afghans fleeing the Taliban following the US’s withdrawal of the US from their country in 2021. Many had been granted humanitarian parole – a temporary legal status that allowed them to live and work in the US while their asylum claims were processed.

The recent arrests “have created a huge chilling effect,” said Shala Gafary, managing director of the Afghan Legal Assistance program at Human Rights First. “People just don’t feel safe to leave their home. People are asking all the time what the process is for going to Canada, or going to another country.”

In the two weeks after an Afghan man was accused of shooting two national guard members, the Trump administration announced major policy changes – radically restricting legal pathways to immigration by pausing asylum decisions for nearly 1.5m people, and halting the processing of applications for green cards, citizenship, or asylum from immigrants from 19 countries.

Despite these policy changes, asylum seekers with removal orders making a case to remain in the US in the justice department immigration courts are still entitled to hearings.

But, in recent weeks, ICE appears to be increasingly arresting Afghans awaiting hearings – forcing them to remain detained until their cases are decided.

Many of those arrested had been complying with requirements to check in with ICE regularly, or wear electronic monitoring devices, attorneys said, and did not have any criminal histories, their attorneys said.

“Clients have expressed to me that they’re feeling deeply unsettled and very fearful of what may happen to them next,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, whose Afghan client – an Afghan asylum seeker – was detained after complying with a request to report to ICE offices in New York City.

“Without any notice or warning, he was cuffed. He was completely shocked and didn’t understand what was happening. And then for some period of time, we didn’t know where he was. His family didn’t know where he was.”

Eventually, Mukherjee said, she was able to figure out he’d been transferred to a detention facility in New Jersey. Neither she nor her client have received any explanation as to why he was arrested, she said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Amir, who was arrested in Bloomington, hasn’t been told why he was arrested either, his brother-in-law Shamsullah said. “The big question for our family is: for what reason was he arrested? He didn’t have a speeding ticket, anything.” The Guardian is not using their full names in order to protect their privacy and safety.

Rearview camera footage from Amir’s car, reviewed by the Guardian, captured three agents wearing FBI vests approaching his vehicle from behind. “You don’t have lawful status to be here. Your visa expired,” an agent told him.

Amir, who was in the car with his mother-in-law, repeatedly asked the agents if he could call his lawyer. “I’m going to let you call them,” one agent told him, before they cuffed his hands behind his back. He wasn’t allowed to call his lawyer on the way, nor was he able to speak with his wife. An agent took his mother-in-law, who couldn’t drive, back to her home.

Amir, who had spoken with the Guardian last week prior to his detention, had fled Afghanistan – where he had been detained by the Taliban due to his family ties to the former government – a year and a half ago. He entered the US via the southern border, using the now defunct CBP One app to schedule an appointment with an immigration officer, and was granted humanitarian parole. He applied for asylum in December last year.

After receiving his work permits in the US, the former electrical engineer had been working in a cafeteria by day and as ride-share driver in the evenings. He had been wearing an ankle monitor as required by ICE.

His detention came as a shock to his family and for the broader Afghan community in Bloomington. “People call me and they ask me: what should we do, what happened?” Shamsullah said. “I tell them I don’t know. I don’t know what we should do.” Amir’s wife, who is pregnant, has been especially struggling, he added.

If he were to return to Afghanistan, the family fears, Amir would be immediately detained. The family is also part of the Hazara Shia minority in Afghanistan, a group that has faced escalating violence and persecution since 2021. “There is no safe place for us in Afghanistan,” Amir told the Guardian last week. “The Taliban without any reason, they arrest people and they kill people.”

Attorneys said they were often at a loss for what to tell clients, many who have fled political prosecution, torture and threats on their lives in Afghanistan after the Taliban retook the country in 2021. “They are afraid, even though they have complied with every provision of US law, even though they have extremely strong cases and we have extensive documentation of their past persecution, whether through medical evaluations or mental health evaluations or photographs of their scars and their burns and other harms that they’ve experienced.”

Attorneys told the Guardian they are still unclear on how various policy changes will play out, if the administration will try to terminate the legal status for Afghans with humanitarian parole, or how long the pause on processing various immigration petitions will last.

“The honest answer is, I do not know, and the administration has not indicated what’s going to happen to those cases,” said Gregory Chen is Senior Director of Government Relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). “The administration has used terms such as indefinite pause, which is, of course, a contradictory oxymoron.”

The arrests and other policy changes have sparked panic, said Wahida Noorzad, an immigration attorney in the Bay Area who has seen two clients arrested and detained at the California City detention center, in the high desert east of Los Angeles. A third Afghan client was detained four weeks ago, prior to the shooting on 26 November.

Noorzad – who herself is Afghan American – said she has started receiving calls from across the region and the US, because she is one of the few immigration attorneys who speaks Dari. “I have many clients that are Afghan in the court system. I don’t know if they’re all going to be picked up,” she said.

Already, she added, it is proving challenging for her to help detained clients who have been transferred to the major ICE detention facility in California city, more than 5 hours drive away from her offices in the Bay Area. It’s also unclear when her detained clients will receive court dates to challenge their detention, and assess their asylum claims, given that about 90 immigration judges have been fired this year and a ballooning immigration court backlong.

For individual attorneys like Noorzad, filing federal habeas corpus petitions to challenge clients’ detention is also logistically challenging and prohibitively expensive.

“I still try to give my clients hope that they’ll hopefully win their cases eventually,” she said. “Because they are really in danger. Nobody leaves home unless they are really fearful.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c8358f864a040ef05327a915bf3f3d656e2d69b/361_0_3613_2891/master/3613.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8712db7a57213207796e7fc3c96b733",N,,2025-12-12 09:57:18.874040

SBCC representatives confirmed that there were at least eight vehicles “with individuals in federal law enforcement attire” gathering in the third floor of the West Campus parking lot from 5:45 p.m. until around 7:10 p.m. SBCC’s Executive Director of Public Affairs and Communications Jordan Killebrew sent out an alert shortly after informing students and faculty of the presence of ICE on campus.

“It appears they were using the SBCC parking lot as a staging area for their next action,” Killebrew said. “SBCC will continue to communicate and ensure our community is informed of any activity that pertains to immigration officers on our campuses. We hope to keep our campuses focused on our goal to provide a place of learning for all who seek it.”

The 805 Immigrant Rapid Response Hotline, which keeps track of reports of immigration enforcement on the Central Coast, began to issue community alerts about the presence of federal law enforcement at SBCC shortly after 6 p.m. “ICE is at SBCC,” the first alert read. “We are out in the streets alerting and gathering information.”

Federal agents were spotted outside a residence near the area of Arrellaga and San Pascual streets around 7 p.m. According to legal observers at the scene, several agents wore masks and vests with “FBI” across the back.

By 7:20 p.m., the vehicles were seen driving away from the area of Loma Alta Drive and Shoreline. Rapid Response volunteers continued patrolling the Westside neighborhood Thursday night, and community alerts were issued asking people to avoid the area if possible.

There is no estimate to how many people were arrested in the coordinated federal action Thursday evening. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for more information, and ICE representatives have previously stated that the agency does not comment on current operations.

Westside Santa Barbara, which is home to a large percentage of Latino residents, has been hit with roving sweeps of unmarked ICE vehicles on several consecutive days this week, starting with an early-morning operation reported near the area of San Pascual and Valerio streets on Tuesday, December 9.

In one video taken by Rapid Response volunteers, masked agents in unmarked cars refused to identify themselves to witnesses at the scene. 805 UndocuFund Executive Director Primitiva Hernandez said at least four community members were arrested the morning of December 9, including one U.S. citizen who was since released from custody.

The Rapid Response hotline reported at least two more arrests in the Westside neighborhood on Wednesday, December 10, just after 6 a.m. near Arrelaga and San Pascual streets.

Many of the arrests in the Westside neighborhood have occurred in public areas such as parking lots and city streets. Hernandez reminded community members that ICE and federal law enforcement cannot enter private property without a warrant, and she said that multiple arrests have been avoided due to people reaching a protected space — either their home or a nearby business.

“ICE or any federal agency still needs a federal warrant signed by a judge to enter those spaces,” Hernandez said. “So if you see ICE and you’re able to put yourself in safety by going into a private space, this is something that is still protected under the U.S. Constitution.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20210306-SBCC-Stock-07-1.webp,N,,2025-12-12 12:58:13.325803

The Law Society of England and Wales is calling on the UK government to ensure that prisons meet human rights standards.

The call comes as the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) publishes new research on worsening conditions in the UK’s overcrowded prisons and immigration centres, which fail to meet international and domestic human rights standards.

The NPM’s report also details the long detention periods in hospital for people with autism and learning disabilities, with no access to therapeutic care. It also raises concern over people allowed to be held indefinitely in immigration centres.

“The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) protects everyday rights, such as being treated with dignity by state authorities or having public services that act for our common good. These rights have served us time and again,” said Law Society of England and Wales president Mark Evans.

“Article 3 of the convention – an absolute right that no one shall be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment – is an important right for everybody in the UK.

“We urge the government to address the concerns raised in this report and ensure that everyone is able to access their rights under the ECHR.

Mark Evans added: “The Law Society has been lobbying on the Mental Health Bill, which protects people with learning disabilities or autistic people from being detained inappropriately. This protection must be extended to all types of hospital detention.

“Legislation should be in place to ensure that mental health patients have access to justice, as well as the dignity and respect they deserve.

“Prison lawyers play a crucial role in supporting those in terrible conditions in prison, but their numbers have been dwindling alarmingly,” concluded Mark Evans.

“The government has finally announced that prison law legal aid fees will increase. This is a step in the right direction but annual reviews of fees and cost-of-living increases are needed to stabilise the future of the profession.

“Sustained funding and reform are needed across the criminal justice system, which is currently failing the public it serves.”",https://prdsitecore93.azureedge.net/-/media/web/project/tls-sites/the-law-society/logos/law-society-logo-green.svg?rev=a720b51104a64c9aac4bc135f03cf17a,N,,2025-12-12 09:57:32.744828

A new report from the University at Buffalo's Human Rights Center highlights the risks migrants face when local police cooperate with ICE. The report's authors support a proposed state law forbidding that cooperation.

A handful of local law enforcement agencies turn migrants they encounter over to federal immigration agencies like the U.S. Border Patrol — a practice some now say should end.

In a report released Wednesday, professors and graduate students with the Buffalo Human Rights Center — part of the University at Buffalo’s law school — detailed the cooperation between local and federal agencies, criticized the practice and called on state lawmakers to ban it.

“Our conclusion across many contexts and many actors is that cooperation between state and local agencies and federal immigration enforcement results in serious violations of individuals’ human rights, affecting their standing, their dignity, their well being,” said Paul Linden-Retek, a University at Buffalo law professor and the center’s co-director.

Linden-Retek said local police detaining migrants on behalf of federal immigration agencies could amount to a violation of the person’s constitutional rights. In Cheektowaga, for example, it’s common for police officers to hold a migrant temporarily before Border Patrol arrives to take custody. Those minutes in between police charging the person for a local offense and federal agents arriving could amount to a 4th Amendment violation, he said.

“Say you have a traffic stop,” Linden-Retek said. “The initial stop might be lawful, right? But the minute that stop prolongs … then you have another seizure. And then that has to be justified.”

In New York, it’s unlawful for a local officer to enforce federal civil law, such as holding a person on suspicion they’re in the country illegally. An officer must have suspicion a federal crime has been committed — such as illegal reentry after a prior deportation — to enforce immigration laws.

Linden-Retek and his law students, along with representatives from the New York Immigration Coalition, Justice for Migrant Families and others called at a Wednesday press conference for lawmakers to pass the New York for All Act. That legislation would codify prior state court rulings and prohibit local police from cooperating with federal law enforcement on immigration matters. It would also restrict information sharing about migrants.

The law would also make moot the formal agreements — called 287g agreements — between local law enforcement and ICE. In Western New York, noted Meghan Maloney de Zaldivar of the New York Immigration Coalition, both the Niagara and Cattaraugus county sheriff’s offices have contracts with ICE to arrest and detain migrants, as well as share information.

The cooperation between local law enforcement is a problem, Linden-Retek and the law students argued, because it stokes fears of detention and deportation and drives migrants underground. Immigrants become less likely to seek legal representation, attend school and church, speak up about workplace violations and call police when someone harms them or they witness a crime, the law students and advocates said Wednesday.

Overly aggressive immigration enforcement, the report states, “emboldens abusive employers while silencing the individuals whose rights are most at risk.”

“The more immigration enforcement you do, the more vulnerable workers will be,” the report, quoting University of Chicago law professor Nicole Hallett, said. “If you want to actually address the labor violations, you have to prioritize that above doing immigration enforcement.”

The report notes a pair of ICE raids this year at Lynn-Ette & Sons Farms, a site of a migrant worker unionization effort, as well alleged labor violations against migrants working at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Buffalo. The report further cites the experience of an Eritrean woman who was not informed of her right to maternal leave so she “hid the fact that she was pregnant from her boss because she did not want to get fired.”

The 93-page report — based on legal research, contemporaneous news coverage and numerous interviews with migrants and their advocates — further details the story of a Cheektowaga woman. A survivor of domestic violence, Maria, the report states, was afraid to call local police on her abuser because she feared she could be deported. As Investigative Post detailed Tuesday, Cheektowaga police are known to question migrants on their legal status and turn them over to Border Patrol agents.

The report goes on to detail how, as Maria’s abuse continued, she eventually opted to call her landlord instead of police. The landlord, however, did call the police.

“When officers came, they violently forced Maria’s door off its hinges and pushed their way into the house. Not long after the police left, ICE came to investigate. Maria knew to ask for a warrant … but with the door shattered she had no way to keep the agents out.”

Maria’s sister-in-law, the report states, was arrested by ICE that day and now faces deportation.

“New York for All is very critical. It protects that due process,” said Flor Saldivar Silvestre, community engagement coordinator with Justice for Migrant Families. “It prevents police … from funnelling into deportation systems and it would hopefully restore that trust that the community should regain in police.”

With regard to education, the report notes an incident earlier this year in which immigration agents stopped a child exiting a school bus and “began to question her with welfare-related questions.” The bus driver, alarmed by the scene, called local police to intervene, which they did. Nevertheless, the girl feared she could have been separated from her family, the report notes.

The release of the report follows a Tuesday investigation by Investigative Post that found police in Cheektowaga, as well as sheriffs deputies in Erie and Niagara counties, are regularly working with federal immigration agencies like Border Patrol and ICE. Police departments in Amherst, Lockport and North Tonawanda are, too. Investigative Post identified 31 people turned over by local law enforcement to federal authorities who were then subject to questioning, detention or deportation. Cheektowaga accounted for 21 of those cases.

The reporting found that while cops can’t enforce federal immigration law, some have made it a practice to question migrants detained for other offenses — like shoplifting or running a stop sign — about their legal status. Speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent can be one factor that leads an officer to question a migrant as to their status.

Then, saying they need to verify the person’s identity, officers call Border Patrol. Border Patrol, in turn — and acting to enforce President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program — takes custody of the person. Representatives of local law enforcement agencies told Investigative Post they don’t take responsibility for what happens to a migrant once federal authorities take custody.

In some cases, U.S. citizens or lawfully-present asylum seekers were subjected to questioning and detention after a run-in with Cheektowaga police.

Through October 15, ICE has arrested more than 1,000 migrants in Western New York this year, 67 percent with no criminal history. That compares to 453 arrests in all of 2024, according to the latest release of ICE arrest figures from the Deportation Data Project. President Donald Trump’s administration has said it aims to arrest 3,000 migrants daily nationwide. Locally, ICE arrests an average of three people per day.

One of the arrestees highlighted in the report was Anderson Contreras-Hernandez, a young man subjected to both the cooperation between police and immigration authorities and the Laken Riley Act. That law, enacted in January, states that migrants accused of certain crimes, including shoplifting, must be held without bond by immigration authorities.

In June, the 20-year-old had been shopping at the Walden Galleria when he was accused of shoplifting. Mall security called Cheektowaga police. An asylum seeker from Venezuela, police were not satisfied when Contreras-Hernandez presented his work authorization ID. They called Border Patrol, which took custody.

A sickle cell flare up landed Contreras-Hernandez in the hospital where he remained, under guard, for weeks. He and his father were eventually deported. His mother and brother later followed them back to Venezuela.

“They said, ‘Being detained and flown all over the country, and being separated from the people I love, and risking whatever happens to me in these jails and detention centers … was worse than whatever I face at home,’” Catharine Grainge, one of his attorneys, said Wednesday.

Had Cheektowaga police not contacted Border Patrol, she said, the family would still be living and working in Buffalo.

America's foreign-born population is shrinking for the first time in generations. It is a historic reversal that is driven by President Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown. As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, most of the decrease seems to be coming not from deportations, but from people choosing to leave.

MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: In late September, the Department of Homeland Security announced what it called a milestone - quote, ""over 2 million illegal aliens out of the United States,"" unquote, since January. Steven Camarota calls these numbers extraordinary.

STEVEN CAMAROTA: Since 1970, the overall immigrant population in the United States has grown steadily - until now.

KASTE: Camarota is director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates restricting immigration. He calculates the total foreign-born population, both legal and illegal status, has shrunk by 2.3 million. That's based on monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics household surveys.

CAMAROTA: It's reasonable to wonder whether all of that is real, but we see some corroboration for this when we look at some other employment data as well. So it looks like something fundamentally has changed with President Trump taking office.

KASTE: This change is very visible to immigration lawyers. In San Jose, California, Richard Hobbs says he has fewer clients now, and those who still come in say they know others who are just going home.

RICHARD HOBBS: But I would say the bigger issue is the overall fear that is driving people away from asking for immigration remedies at all.

KASTE: That may be a result of stories like what recently happened in San Diego. Tessa Cabrera, an immigration lawyer there, recalls the moment last month when ICE suddenly started showing up during immigration formalities and arresting anyone with less-than-legal status. It happened to a client of hers doing his final interview for a green card - permanent legal status.

TESSA CABRERA: The client had signed his application digitally on their iPad. The officer said, I'll be right back, stepped out. And in walked two ICE officers and - asked him for his name and then put him in handcuffs.

KASTE: Keep in mind, this happened in a bureaucratic setting, not immigration court and not an ICE check-in. This means more risk now for people who want to try to legalize their status. Cabrera calls it one of the most chilling experiences of her career.

CABRERA: To have that trust that you put in the government to adjudicate - and actually, you know, pay the government to adjudicate your case - just entirely violated was just astonishing.

KASTE: And stories like that are definitely reaching other immigrants, like Sara Pereira (ph). She and her husband came here illegally from Brazil during the Biden years. She says they just wanted to earn some money and go back home. Her husband was recently deported, and she is still in the Boston area lying low.

SARA PEREIRA: (Speaking Portuguese).

KASTE: ""I can't walk down the street, I get so anxious,"" she says.

PEREIRA: (Speaking Portuguese).

KASTE: ""If it were up to me, I would have left already,"" Pereira says. But she can't just yet because she was scammed out of her travel money by someone offering legal help on the internet. She knows the U.S. government offers a $1,000 stipend to people who self-deport using the Customs and Border Protection app, but she says, no way.

PEREIRA: (Speaking Portuguese).

KASTE: ""I don't trust it,"" she says. She worries about legal penalties and that the app might track her or the people she associates with. Some of them are thinking of leaving, too.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We don't want them.

KASTE: And that's in line with President Trump's vision of slowing or even stopping immigration. Here he is on Thanksgiving after two National Guardsmen were shot near the White House, allegedly by an immigrant from Afghanistan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: They come in illegally, have a lot of problems. Their countries force them in because their countries are smart. They don't want them.

KASTE: Trump's message seems to be having an effect. At CIS, Steven Camarota wishes ICE enforcement focused more on work sites, but he thinks the publicity around these individual arrests is also pushing people to leave on their own.

CAMAROTA: Everyone I talk to in immigrant communities feels a great deal more concerned that enforcement has become a very real possibility.

KASTE: According to the administration's estimates, self-deportation is four times more frequent than compelled deportation, though the government is holding a record number of immigrants right now, and many, quote, ""volunteer to leave"" just so they can get out of detention. It's hard to know what long-term effect this enforcement pressure will have on future immigration.

PEREIRA: (Cooing, laughter).

KASTE: Holding her baby boy - born here - Sara Pereira says she's leaving in January but hopes to come back.

PEREIRA: (Speaking Portuguese).

KASTE: ""My son is an American, and I think he deserves to have the benefits of this country,"" she says. She hopes that when the temporary ban on her husband's reentry lapses, they can pick up where they left off. Martin Kaste, NPR News.

Noem, who heads the agency central to President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, received backup from Republicans on the panel but faced fierce questioning from Democrats -- including many who called for her resignation over the mass deportation agenda.

The secretary's testimony was immediately interrupted by protesters shouting for her to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and ""end deportations."" They trailed her down the halls as she left early for another engagement, chanting, ""Shame on you!""

But she vowed she ""would not back down.""

""What keeps me up at night is that we don't necessarily know all of the people that are in this country, who they are and what their intentions are,"" Noem said.

The hearing was Noem's first public appearance before Congress in months, testifying at the House Committee on Homeland Security on ""Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,"" and it quickly grew heated as she emphasized how big a role she believed immigration played in those threats. It focused heavily on the Trump administration's immigration policies, whereas in years past the hearing has centered on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, the panel's ranking Democrat, said Noem has diverted vast taxpayer resources to carry out Trump's ""extreme"" immigration agenda and failed to provide basic responses as Congress conducts its oversight.

""I call on you to resign,"" the Mississippi congressman said. ""Do a real service to the country.""

Several Democrats repeatedly told Noem flatly that she was ""lying"" to them and to the public over claims they are focused on violent criminals. They presented cases of U.S. citizens being detained in immigration operations and families of American military veterans being torn apart by deportations of loved ones who have not committed serious crimes or other violations.

""You lie with impunity,"" said Rep. Delia Rodriguez, D-Ill., who said Noem should resign or be impeached.

Republicans largely thanked Noem for the work the department is doing to keep the country safe and urged her to carry on.

""Deport them all,"" said Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn.

Noem, whose own family, including an infant granddaughter, was in the audience, praised the Trump administration's efforts when it comes to immigration, saying, ""We're ending illegal immigration, returning sanity to our immigration system.""

Asked about the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast, Noem linked it to the Trump administration's anti-drug campaign in the region, saying cocaine had been kept from entering the U.S. as a result.

During one sharp exchange, the secretary levied broad criticism for the program through which the man suspected of shooting two National Guard members last month came to the United States.

""Unfortunate accident?"" Noem retorted after Thompson raised the issue. She called it a ""terrorist attack.""

The program, Operation Allies Welcome, was created by then-President Joe Biden's Democratic administration after the 2021 decision to leave Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars in aid. Thompson pointed out that the Trump administration approved the asylum claim of the suspect in the National Guard attack.

The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to question the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center.

FBI Director Kash Patel did not appear, but sent Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.

Glasheen said the nation faces ""serious and evolving"" threats, and pointed to so-called antifa, and Trump's executive order designating the group as a domestic terror organization, as the ""most immediate violent threat"" facing the country.

Pressed by Thompson for details -- where is antifa headquartered? How many members does it have? -- the FBI's representative appeared unable to provide answers, saying it's ""fluid"" and investigations are ""ongoing.""

He did not identify immigration as among the most pressing concerns for the homeland.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211746634_4Ahomelandsec1212_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-12-12 08:58:55.966118

Now his resignation letter is part of his stump speech for Congress,"MARC LEVY Associated Press, ABC News",,,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ryan-crosswell-quit-trumps-doj-now-resignation-letter-128335542,"ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Many political candidates like to talk up their résumé in their stump speech.

“I pray that the Department of Justice remains dedicated to upholding the rule of law evenly without fear or favor.

But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that.","ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Many political candidates like to talk up their résumé in their stump speech.

Ryan Crosswell reads from his resignation letter.

A former federal prosecutor now running for Congress, he quit in February when President Donald Trump's administration dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in return for his cooperation on immigration enforcement.

“I pray that the Department of Justice remains dedicated to upholding the rule of law evenly without fear or favor. Sincerely, Ryan Crosswell,"" he read at a recent campaign event.

The line got applause and whoops from dozens of Democratic Party activists who had gathered to see him in the West End Taproom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Crosswell is one of five candidates who are vying for the opportunity to unseat Republican Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a top target of Democrats in next year's midterm election, when control of the U.S. House will be on the line.

Polling shows that voters prioritize economic issues, and Democrats have focused on concerns about affordability as they try to claw back power in Washington.

Crosswell is testing a different approach, relying on his law enforcement and corruption-fighting background amid fears about how Trump is reshaping the nation's justice system.

Voters often ask him about Trump's pardons for the politically connected, immigration enforcement officers using force, U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean or prosecutions against the president's enemies.

""I think I get asked that probably more than the average candidate, but I also lean into it,” Crosswell said in an interview.

Mackenzie’s campaign said voters in Pennsylvania “aren’t interested in a lecture, they’re interested in the issues — affordability, public safety and national security.”

Crosswell's background was a draw for many who came to see him at the event.

“I like that he quit his job because he was given a job that went against his moral compass,” said Elisabeth Grant.

Grant and others said they believe Trump is attacking the rule of law, and many described it a top motivation.

Some described personal fears. Joe McDermott said he is outspoken on Facebook about his criticism of the Trump administration — ""I refer to it as a ‘crime family’” — and people ask him if he isn’t afraid that someone will come after him.

He is, and he wouldn’t discount the Department of Justice going after someone like himself.

“I would not put anything beneath them right now,” McDermott said.

Joniel Colon Rosario is thinking twice about whether he should speak his native Spanish on the street around strangers.

“I don’t know if some random guy in a ski mask is going to come down and tackle me because I’m speaking my native tongue,” said Colon Rosario, who is originally from Puerto Rico.

Crosswell said voters are worried that the government “appears to do anything the president orders.”

""People aren’t asking, ‘How can my government protect me?’ It’s, ‘How can I protect myself from my government?’” he said.

It’s no wonder Democrats are eager to challenge Mackenzie. A freshman, Mackenzie was a state lawmaker when he won his race for Congress by 1 percentage point last year, among the narrowest margins in the country.

Crosswell — also a former active-duty U.S. Marine and a current reservist — isn’t alone in leaving federal government service this year to run as a Democrat.

Zach Dembo, a former federal prosecutor and Navy lawyer who worked briefly for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, is running for an open seat in Kentucky. And John Sullivan, a former FBI intelligence official, is running for a Republican-held seat in New York’s Hudson Valley.

Crosswell, 45, will have some baggage in his primary contest.

He changed his registration from Republican to Democrat a year ago. After he resigned in February, he moved from Washington, D.C., to Allentown — about 45 miles from where he grew up in Pottsville, Pa.

Crosswell remembers thinking, “Do I want to leave public service or do I want to fight back?”

It's unclear whether a corruption-fighting message will carry the day in either a primary or general election.

Polling has consistently showed that Americans are more focused on economic issues than broader concerns about how government is functioning.

A CNN poll from August found roughly 4 in 10 U.S. adults said economic concerns were the most important problems facing the country, and only about 1 in 10 named attitudes about government, including concerns about the rule of law or corruption.

The House Democrats' campaign arm, which is officially neutral in Crosswell's primary race, said the midterms are “shaping up to be a referendum on who is going to lower costs and help improve the lives of everyday Americans, not the wealthy and well-connected.”

Crosswell acknowledges that not everybody is concerned about how Trump wields power, and that it depends on the audience.

Jon Macklin, a Crosswell supporter who goes door-to-door for Democratic candidates, told a similar story. People he meets who are less engaged with politics are most concerned about their finances and how the economy is affecting them.

But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that. And he intends to drive home that message. In other words, a corrupt government and a corrupt economy can hurt everyone.

“Corruption is a kitchen table issue,” Crosswell said. “Because public office is a public trust.”

After a hiatus, the United Methodist Immigration Task Force has reorganized and renewed ties across church ministries in support of immigrants.

At its recent gathering, the group heard accounts of racial profiling, violent detentions, family separations and children appearing alone in immigration court.

The task force has issued an Advent call urging the church to welcome, accompany and advocate for migrants.

Immigration raids and federal policies that have left tens of thousands of people without legal status continue to affect communities nationwide, including United Methodist congregations.

Responding to the growing need, the United Methodist Immigration Task Force met Nov. 18-20 in Los Angeles, with support from the United Methodist Commission on Religion and Race and the Board of Church and Society, bringing together church agencies, migrant ministries, bishops and ecumenical partners to strengthen coordinated advocacy.

The meeting was a historic opportunity to reorganize the task force after a period of interruption, said Bishop Minerva Carcaño, who chairs the group. She emphasized that a mandate from The United Methodist Church’s top lawmaking assembly, General Conference, affirms the group’s work and grants authority to advance migrant-focused initiatives.

“The expectation for this meeting, after a period of interruption, was to reform the task force in every sense: to rebuild it, rethink how we work and ensure we respond effectively to this unprecedented crisis,” Carcaño said. “We now have a stronger, more diverse team with renewed commitment to serve our communities.

“Having experts with direct experience in migration issues allows us to better understand the challenges migrants face and craft meaningful strategies,” she said. “At the same time, we are working to clarify the roles of each entity to avoid duplicated efforts and strengthen collaboration.”

The Rev. Giovanni Arroyo, top staff executive of the Commission on Religion and Race, highlighted the value of shared commitment and coordination.

“This meeting reaffirmed our unity across agencies and helped us discern how, together, we can support communities impacted by immigration enforcement,” he said. “It was an opportunity to build networks of collaboration and explore ways to expand our joint efforts for justice.

“The work of the church is both external and internal: While we challenge inequitable systems, we also teach, preach and develop a theology that emphasizes God’s preferential care for marginalized communities. Our goal is a faith-based response that is prophetic, informed and effective,” he said.

Migration ministry leaders shared accounts of racial profiling, violent detentions, inhumane conditions in detention centers (including more than 20 reported deaths), family separations, coerced self-deportation and children appearing alone in immigration court.

“Hearing these stories is essential,” said the Rev. Camille Henderson-Edwards, executive director for advocacy at the Board of Church and Society. “It connects us with the lived realities of migrants and informs the legislative and advocacy work we do.

“Our role is to ensure that church leaders are equipped to advocate with both knowledge and empathy,” she said. “We also learned how vital collaboration with other agencies, caucuses and plans is, so we can respond collectively and strategically. We left this meeting with a renewed understanding of our responsibilities — both individually and collectively — to build a unified Methodist response to migration issues.”

Next steps for 2026

With national elections approaching, Carcaño cautioned that migration may continue to be used politically to manipulate narratives and mobilize voters.

“Church leaders must uphold truth, confront injustice and acknowledge the human impact on children, elderly, women and other vulnerable populations,” she said. “Migrants are part of our church, and we must address these issues together. Our actions now will shape the identity and future of United Methodism in the United States and influence how we partner globally.”

Church and Society will prioritize strengthening immigration advocacy networks, rapid-response teams, and training United Methodists to engage lawmakers, including advancing the Dignity Act on Capitol Hill and equipping members for faith-informed conversations with legislative staff.

U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) has been an exemplary advocate in Congress, according to Henderson-Edwards. “She is a United Methodist and frequently speaks about her roots and upbringing in the church. She is an extremely valuable legislative supporter, especially on this issue of immigration. We look forward to continuing to strengthen our collaboration with her and her office.”

Carcaño assured immigrant families that church leaders walk alongside them. “We are committed to accompany you in every way we can, to learn from your resilience and wisdom, and to work together toward a more just and compassionate society. Your courage strengthens our faith and reminds us of the Gospel mandate to serve others,” she said.

Henderson-Edwards added a pastoral perspective: “As a pastor, I see the Gospel as a message of hope. God is present in our struggles and knows our needs even before we can identify them. My invitation is to trust in that God, who walks with us through every challenge and guides us in our work for justice.”

The task force is mandated to guide the denomination in a prophetic response to migration challenges. Through coordination, situational analysis, education and action plans, the team seeks to unite efforts, advocating for the rights of migrants and refugees, offering legal and pastoral support, promoting policies that honor human dignity, denouncing inhumane practices and welcoming those who arrive in their communities.

For Arroyo, the challenge facing the church is the division between different positions regarding immigration justice, and the creation of spaces to engage in this conversation from a theological perspective that contributes to the discipleship formation of United Methodists.

An Advent call

As its meeting concluded, the task force issued a statement calling all United Methodist congregations and ministries to welcome, accompany and advocate for migrants. The document emphasizes that migration is not a new phenomenon but an ancient human experience reflected throughout Scripture — from Abraham’s journey to the Exodus — and the early church’s movement across borders. It notes that God calls the church to respond with compassion, justice and protection for those who are vulnerable.

The statement highlights the global scale of displacement, noting that millions of people are forced to flee their homes due to war, poverty, violence, climate change and oppressive systems. In the United States, recent immigration policies have intensified the suffering of families, resulting in migrants being criminalized and treated with contempt and children being separated from parents. The statement directly criticizes President Donald J. Trump’s administration for dehumanizing rhetoric, mass deportations and agreements with other countries to detain expelled migrants.

Citing the United Methodist Book of Resolutions, the document affirms that remaining silent in the face of family separation and the demonization of migrants constitutes complicity with sin. It reiterates core church principles: the equal dignity of all people, equitable access to rights and opportunities, protection of family unity, and the defense of human and civil rights.

The Advent call also provides concrete guidance for congregations and ministries, urging them to:

Hold conference-level discussions and public witness on immigration issues.

Develop safety plans for raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection agency.

Support the Immigration Law and Justice Network and its sites.

Collaborate with Church World Service, national mission institutions and community organizations.

Apply for Global Ministries’ Community Engagement Grants and the United Methodist Committee on Relief’s Mustard Seed Migration Grants.

Build rapid-response teams with the Board of Church and Society.

Share migrant stories with United Methodist Communications.

Use the Commission on Religion and Race’s expertise in trauma-informed ministry and cross-cultural collaboration.

Involve migrants directly in planning local ministry efforts.

Use educational resources at ResourceUMC.org/Immigration.

The document emphasizes that congregations already supporting migrants — many of whom are themselves members or pastors living under fear of detention or deportation — serve as vital examples for the church. Bishops, clergy and lay leaders are called to stand firmly alongside these communities, embodying the Advent hope of God’s justice and mercy and living out the Gospel’s mandate to care for the most vulnerable.

A federal judge in Maryland ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia freed from immigration detention on Thursday while his legal challenge against his deportation moves forward, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must let Abrego Garcia go immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.”

The Department of Homeland Security was highly critical of the release order and vowed to oppose it, calling it “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. “This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Messages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia’s attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the order.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His lawsuit in federal court claims Trump’s Republican administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish Abrego Garcia over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The reference was made to the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia to and submitted affirmations that Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to accept him — later determined to be untrue.

“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.

Xinis also dismissed the federal government’s arguments that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a final order of removal, noting that order had not been filed.

“Thus, Abrego Garcia’s request for immediate release cannot touch upon the execution of a removal order if no such order exists,” she wrote.

Meanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States.

Additionally, Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.

His defense attorney in the Tennessee case, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.

A judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2025/12/AP25337757574337-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 06:57:29.768113

Abrego Garcia's case a key test of Trump's immigration policies

Abrego Garcia's case has become a symbol of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, as his legal battles highlight the new deportation policies the administration has sought to use.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that Abrego Garcia is a member of the Salvadoran gang known as MS-13 and should not be allowed to stay in the US.

An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from gang violence that targeted his family.

When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump's immigration enforcement actions.

His family and attorneys deny that he has any gang connection.

In Inglewood Wednesday morning, a white work van with ladders strapped to its roof sat empty in a parking lot near Sip Café. Employees inside told the Nashville Banner the van’s driver had been stopped by armed men in unmarked vehicles, who handcuffed him and took him away. The armed men, the employees said, were not wearing uniforms or badges indicating that they were with a government agency. On social media, word spread that the unidentified men were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""We are horrified that something this vile happened outside Sip,” reads a post on the shop’s Instagram account. “We urge all of our friends to be careful — this ambush happened out in the street just a little while ago.""

It was one of multiple incidents that fueled alarm and uncertainty among immigrant communities and advocate networks throughout the day, as reported ICE sightings came from East and South Nashville. Rapid response operations like Music City MigraWatch posted photos on social media of what they believed to be ICE vehicles and the empty work vans left behind by the people ICE had taken. One post showed a white van pulled over by unmarked vehicles with red and blue flashing lights on Bell Road.

But getting clear information about what had happened or was happening — who was taken and by whom — was complicated, given the agency’s tactics. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Highway Patrol — which collaborated with federal agents during a large operation in Nashville in May — told the Banner they were “not aware of any such activity.” A spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department also said its officers weren’t involved in the incidents reported on social media Wednesday. ICE officials could not be reached for comment.

The Spanish-language news outlet Nashville Noticias reported Wednesday evening that at least eight people had been taken into custody by ICE agents in various locations, citing relatives of the people who’d been detained.

Ashley Warbington, an advocate with Music City MigraWatch, tells the Banner the group first received a tip around 6:30 a.m. from a person who believed they’d seen ICE agents in Nippers Corner in South Nashville. A volunteer named Carleen, who asked that her last name be withheld, says she and her husband drove to the area to verify the report and saw unmarked vehicles with flashing blue and red lights surrounding a red work van in the center lane of a five-lane road. By the time they turned around, the van had been moved to a nearby parking lot and was unoccupied. She did not see anyone being detained. She said the group had flagged one of the vehicles as having ""been associated with ICE in the past"" and was further convinced of the affiliation by the red and blue lights.

Warbington says volunteers and community members have been following Music City MigraWatch’s reports of ICE activity on social media accounts and alerting the group when they believe they see the same vehicles in other areas.

One of the group’s volunteers arrived at Sip Café three minutes after receiving a call about suspected ICE activity there, but the reported agents were already gone. It’s not clear how many people were detained at that location.

Warbington says Wednesday was an unusually active day for ICE watchers in Nashville.

“We’ve had days similar in the past couple of weeks, but it has been in Lebanon, for example, or in Franklin,” Warbington says. “This was mostly in Davidson County.”

The apparent incident at Sip Café, she says, had set off a flurry of rumors and reports of ICE activity elsewhere in the East Nashville area, most of which could not be verified. Music City MigraWatch received at least 20 calls, she says, on top of numerous text messages and social media messages.

“My fingers are tired from texting, I’ll just say that,” says Warbington.

Zach Young, who represents the Inglewood area on the Metro Nashville Public Schools board, says he heard from another public official that a suspected ICE vehicle had been spotted near an elementary school in the neighborhood. He says he informed the principal, who was “already standing in his office looking out the window.” Young says school officials are “very well versed” in policies for responding to a law enforcement inquiry, including seeking counsel from Metro lawyers.

According to Young, it appears that the suspected ICE vehicle was only coincidentally in the area and not targeting the school.

“It would be terrible for ICE to conduct any sort of enforcement around a school, because we want families to think of schools as a safe space,” he said.

On Wednesday afternoon and into the evening, the Banner observed white passenger vans and other unmarked vehicles with government and out-of-state plates entering and exiting a federal law enforcement facility off Brick Church Pike Wednesday afternoon, mirroring activity at the same facility where people were detained during the May ICE operation.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nashvillescene.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/59/359258b3-cea6-479e-a9dc-a48367016f4b/693aee7d8bd57.preview.png?crop=1187%2C623%2C2%2C0,N,,2025-12-12 05:56:47.887683

The detentions occurred after U.S. marshals alerted ICE to suspected immigration violations while searching for a different individual.

Local police were not involved in the federal operation. Immigrant advocacy groups have provided resources for those affected.

Three people were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in York City in a moment depicted on a photo on social media.

After receiving a concerned call about the ICE sighting, Mayor Michael Helfrich said he contacted an official at ICE's Philadelphia office, which oversees the southcentral Pennsylvania region, to find out what happened.

According to Helfrich, the ICE official said that three people were detained on Tuesday afternoon after U.S. Marshals alerted the agency of suspected immigration violations.

U.S. Marshals, Helfrich said he was told, responded to a home along West Jackson Street in the city that morning. A warrant was out for a man accused of sex crimes, but marshals did not find him there.

""When they got to the house, they found that it was full of unrelated people who were not documented,"" Helfrich said.

A photo of the encounter has been shared widely on Facebook. It shows several people standing on a sidewalk near a street corner as a man appears to lead another into a white Ford Transit van.

Tuesday's incident was the latest in a series of raids that have taken place in York.

ICE has not confirmed the activity to The York Dispatch. Jason Koontz, public affairs officer for ICE's Philadelphia field office, did not return a call. When returning an email inquiry, Koontz asked for names and birthdates for the people involved.

According to Helfrich, marshals called ICE agents to the scene. Those agents detained three of the eight people discovered, the mayor said.

As for the other five, Helfrich said he didn't know what happened, other than ""apparently, they did not get detained.""

It's unclear how marshals or ICE agents determined the people found at the home were not documented.

York City Police were not involved, Helfrich said.

""It was the federal government coming in to serve a warrant through the U.S. Marshals, and that agency discovered some other infractions,"" Helfrich said. ""So they reported it to the other federal agency that was responsible for that.""

The York City School District was not aware of any direct impact on its students or families, according to ShaiQuana Mitchell, the district's supervisor of communications and marketing.

""If any student or family expresses a need for support, our school counselors and student services team are prepared to assist,"" Mitchell said in an email.

Rising ICE activity in central Pennsylvania

In February, not long after President Donald Trump took office amid promises of sweeping raids against immigrants, Noel Chinchilla-Avilez was arrested by ICE agents in a viral social media video. He was eventually deported to Honduras.

In June, the arrest of ""a long-time member of our community"" by federal immigration officers prompted Helfrich to warn others who may be in a similar situation.

""This is not a detention due to criminal activity,"" Helfrich wrote, in a statement issued by the city at the time. ""We have no reason to believe at York City that this individual was part of any criminal activity, there was no evidence of such in York City's records, and this was not a reason given by ICE for his detention.""

Figures from the research group, the Deportation Data Project, show that ICE apprehended 196 people in York County from January through October, according to the most recent data available.

Despite Trump's promise to crack down on violent criminals during his 2024 presidential campaign, available data shows that the majority of individuals who've been arrested had no prior history of criminal convictions — or only minor offenses, such as traffic summonses.

Support for immigrants

The Pennsylvania Immigration Resource Center operates a rapid response hotline for those affected by ICE activity. The organization encourages the public to call or text 717-229-7452 to reach the hotline for information and support. You can reach people staffing the hotline everyday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and you can leave a message after hours.

CASA, an immigrant advocacy group, issued guidance on how individuals can protect their rights during encounters with ICE.

According to CASA’s “Know Your Rights” information, individuals have the right to remain silent if questioned about immigration status and do not have to answer questions beyond providing their name if required by law. If ICE agents arrive at the door, individuals may ask for them to provide evidence of a warrant before opening. CASA offers a full guide on its website at wearecasa.org/know-your-rights.

CASA also operates an ICE raid activity hotline at 1-888-214-6016.

Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown earlier this year when he was wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. He was last taken into custody in August during a similar check-in.

He’s scheduled to appear in the morning at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore.

The agency freed him just before 5 p.m. on Thursday in response to a ruling from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland, who wrote federal authorities detained him after his return to the United States without any legal basis.

Mistakenly deported and then returned

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under ICE supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump’s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked a federal judge there to dismiss them.

A lawsuit to block removal from U.S.

The 2019 settlement found he had a “well founded fear” of danger in El Salvador if he was deported there. So instead ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. Abrego Garcia has sued, claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish him for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” Xinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.

ICE freed Abrego Garcia from Moshannon Valley Processing Center, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, on Thursday just before the deadline Xinis gave the government to provide an update on Abrego Garcia’s release.

He returned home to Maryland a few hours later.

Immigration check-in

Check-ins are how ICE keeps track of some people who are released by the government to pursue asylum or other immigration cases as they make their way through a backlogged court system. The appointments were once routine but many people have been detained at their check-ins since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said he’s prepared to defend his client against further deportation efforts.

“The government still has plenty of tools in their toolbox, plenty of tricks up their sleeve,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said, adding he fully expects the government to again take steps to deport his client. “We’re going to be there to fight to make sure there is a fair trial.”

The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized Xinis’ order and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.

“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the judge made it clear that the government can’t detain someone indefinitely without legal authority and that his client “has endured more than anyone should ever have to.”

Abrego Garcia has also applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.

Charges in Tennessee

Abrego Garcia was hit with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling charges when the U.S. government brought him back from El Salvador. Prosecutors alleged he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.

Ryan Crosswell reads from his resignation letter.

A former federal prosecutor now running for Congress, he quit in February when President Donald Trump's administration dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in return for his cooperation on immigration enforcement.

“I pray that the Department of Justice remains dedicated to upholding the rule of law evenly without fear or favor. Sincerely, Ryan Crosswell,"" he read at a recent campaign event.

The line got applause and whoops from dozens of Democratic Party activists who had gathered to see him in the West End Taproom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Crosswell is one of five candidates who are vying for the opportunity to unseat Republican Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a top target of Democrats in next year's midterm election, when control of the U.S. House will be on the line.

Polling shows that voters prioritize economic issues, and Democrats have focused on concerns about affordability as they try to claw back power in Washington.

Crosswell is testing a different approach, relying on his law enforcement and corruption-fighting background amid fears about how Trump is reshaping the nation's justice system.

Voters often ask him about Trump's pardons for the politically connected, immigration enforcement officers using force, U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean or prosecutions against the president's enemies.

""I think I get asked that probably more than the average candidate, but I also lean into it,” Crosswell said in an interview.

Mackenzie’s campaign said voters in Pennsylvania “aren’t interested in a lecture, they’re interested in the issues — affordability, public safety and national security.”

Running amid fears of authoritarianism

Crosswell's background was a draw for many who came to see him at the event.

“I like that he quit his job because he was given a job that went against his moral compass,” said Elisabeth Grant.

Grant and others said they believe Trump is attacking the rule of law, and many described it a top motivation.

Some described personal fears. Joe McDermott said he is outspoken on Facebook about his criticism of the Trump administration — ""I refer to it as a ‘crime family’” — and people ask him if he isn’t afraid that someone will come after him.

He is, and he wouldn’t discount the Department of Justice going after someone like himself.

“I would not put anything beneath them right now,” McDermott said.

Joniel Colon Rosario is thinking twice about whether he should speak his native Spanish on the street around strangers.

“I don’t know if some random guy in a ski mask is going to come down and tackle me because I’m speaking my native tongue,” said Colon Rosario, who is originally from Puerto Rico.

Crosswell said voters are worried that the government “appears to do anything the president orders.”

""People aren’t asking, ‘How can my government protect me?’ It’s, ‘How can I protect myself from my government?’” he said.

A prime swing seat in Pennsylvania

It’s no wonder Democrats are eager to challenge Mackenzie. A freshman, Mackenzie was a state lawmaker when he won his race for Congress by 1 percentage point last year, among the narrowest margins in the country.

Crosswell — also a former active-duty U.S. Marine and a current reservist — isn’t alone in leaving federal government service this year to run as a Democrat.

Zach Dembo, a former federal prosecutor and Navy lawyer who worked briefly for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, is running for an open seat in Kentucky. And John Sullivan, a former FBI intelligence official, is running for a Republican-held seat in New York’s Hudson Valley.

Crosswell, 45, will have some baggage in his primary contest.

He changed his registration from Republican to Democrat a year ago. After he resigned in February, he moved from Washington, D.C., to Allentown — about 45 miles from where he grew up in Pottsville, Pa.

Crosswell remembers thinking, “Do I want to leave public service or do I want to fight back?”

Economic fears are No. 1 in polls

It's unclear whether a corruption-fighting message will carry the day in either a primary or general election.

Polling has consistently showed that Americans are more focused on economic issues than broader concerns about how government is functioning.

A CNN poll from August found roughly 4 in 10 U.S. adults said economic concerns were the most important problems facing the country, and only about 1 in 10 named attitudes about government, including concerns about the rule of law or corruption.

The House Democrats' campaign arm, which is officially neutral in Crosswell's primary race, said the midterms are “shaping up to be a referendum on who is going to lower costs and help improve the lives of everyday Americans, not the wealthy and well-connected.”

Crosswell acknowledges that not everybody is concerned about how Trump wields power, and that it depends on the audience.

Jon Macklin, a Crosswell supporter who goes door-to-door for Democratic candidates, told a similar story. People he meets who are less engaged with politics are most concerned about their finances and how the economy is affecting them.

But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that. And he intends to drive home that message. In other words, a corrupt government and a corrupt economy can hurt everyone.

“Corruption is a kitchen table issue,” Crosswell said. “Because public office is a public trust.”

USA TODAY

Dec. 11, 2025, 5:43 p.m. ET

A monthslong effort by the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops under federal control in U.S. cities keeps evolving amid a barrage of legal challenges.

The deployments have ramped up and down in cities including Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis. The administration often cited crime and protests as reasons for the deployments over the legal objections of local leaders.

Trial courts around the country have ruled the deployments are illegal and unwarranted, but the administration has challenged these rulings in appeals courts, often resulting in orders blocking the deployments being put on hold.

A federal judge in California, for example, ordered an end to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles on Dec. 10. The decision came just days after an appeals court paused a lower court order that would have ended the deployment in Washington, DC on Dec. 11.

All eyes are currently on the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to weigh in on whether Trump can deploy the National Guard in Chicagowhile the case progresses. It's a decision that likely won’t put an end to the litigation, but could have implications for other cities, according to Joseph Nunn, a legal expert on National Guard deployments with the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program.

""While the Supreme Court has just been sitting on this and presumably writing opinions, everyone else is kind of holding their breath,"" said Nunn.

Meanwhile, the status of the Guard deployments has been constantly in flux with many now remaining under federal control but unable to be deployed as the legal battles play out.

Here’s a look at where things stand across the nation

Los Angeles

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Los Angeles became one of the first locations for Trump's National Guard deployments in June. The administration sent about 4,000 California guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to protect federal personnel and property amid demonstrations against a wave of immigration raids that sometimes turned violent.

Are troops still on the ground? As immigration protests dwindled, the Pentagon withdrew a majority of the troops. But the administration issued new orders federalizing the remaining 300 California National Guard troops first through November and then through February. As of Dec. 11, 100 federalized California National Guard members remain at various locations in LA, according to court documents.

What have courts said? Gov. Gavin Newsom swiftly sued the administration, arguing Trump had overstepped his authority. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that Trump had deployed the Guard unlawfully, but a federal appeals court let Trump retain control of the state's National Guard while the governor's lawsuit proceeded. California challenged the new orders federalizing troops through February, and Breyer sided with the state again on Dec. 10.

Chicago

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Trump deployed 300 Illinois National Guard troops to the city in October to support immigration enforcement officers facing fierce pushback from protestors.

Are troops still on the ground? Three hundred Illinois National Guard members remain federalized but are “not engaging in Federal Protection Mission operational activities,” according to NORAD and U.S. Northern Command. Troops from Texas reportedly began withdrawing from Chicago in November, Reuters reported.

What have courts said? State and local leaders immediately sued the Trump administration after troops were deployed. A federal judge in Chicago temporarily blocked the deployment, saying it “is likely to lead to civil unrest.” A federal appeals court largely upheld that decision, but said Trump could still federalize the National Guard, and troops already deployed don’t need to return home yet. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to remove a lower court's block on his deployment of troops in Chicago. The high court asked both sides to explain their interpretation of language in the statute that gives the president the authority to federalize the Guard, and a decision could come any day, Nunn said.

Will this case impact other cities? ""Whatever we get from the Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to be some kind of final merit ruling,"" Nunn said. ""But it is still going to have a very profound impact, I'm sure, on both the Illinois case, but also the Portland and Los Angeles cases just because the lower courts are going to look to see what the Supreme Court does and take guidance from that.""

Portland

When were National Guard Troops deployed and why? Trump announced in September he was sending the Guard to Portland, a liberal stronghold he described as “war ravaged” and “burning to the ground.”

Are troops still on the ground? Gov. Tina Kotek said on Nov. 19 that 100 of the 200 Oregon National Guard members who were put under federal control on Sept. 28 would remain federalized. The announcement, prompted by a temporary order from the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, was a major reversal that came an hour after the governor said all the troops would be returning home. Newsom's office said the Defense Department told the state that its National Guard members would start returning from Oregon, Reuters reported in November.

What have courts said? The deployment was immediately challenged in court by city and state officials. In early October, U.S. District Court judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued temporary restraining orders blocking the federalization and deployment of the National Guard troops from Oregon and any other state. After a three-day trial in early November, Immergut ruled troops could not be deployed in Portland. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where it previously received a favorable ruling in the Los Angeles case.

Washington, DC

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Trump sent thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops into the nation's capital after declaring a “crime emergency” on Aug. 11.

Are troops still on the ground? The administration announced it would deploy 500 more troops in response to a deadly ""ambush"" on two guardsmen. Approximately 2,781 National Guard members are on the ground in Washington, according to the Joint Task Force – District of Columbia.

What have courts said? The city government sued the Trump administration in September, arguing the deployment is unconstitutional and violates federal law. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with the city, temporarily blocking the administration from deploying troops to enforce the law without approval from Mayor Muriel Bowser. But an appeals court lifted Cobb's injunction, which would have forced troops to leave by Dec. 11. The order is temporary and does not address the merits of the case.

Will this case impact other cities? Trump's authority to use the guard in Washington is unique because it is the seat of the federal government. That means ""basically everything"" about the case is different than the litigation in other cities and the impact of the outcome will be limited to DC, Nunn said.

Memphis

When were National Guard troops deployed and why? Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, welcomed the president's September announcement that he would deploy troops to Memphis despite objections from Mayor Paul Young.

Are troops still on the ground? The number of National Guard troops in Memphis has increased to about 245, a spokesperson with the Memphis Police Department confirmed on Dec. 4.

What have courts said? Several elected officials have sued Lee over the deployment. On Nov. 17, a Tennessee judge temporarily blocked the deployment, aligning with state and local lawmakers who said use of the troops for law enforcement violates the state constitution. Judge Patricia Head Moskal said the city’s crime rates were not a ""grave emergency"" or ""disaster"" justifying military intervention by the governor. The state of Tennessee on Dec. 2 appealed that decision, and Moskal's injunction blocking the deployment is not in effect while the appeal is pending.

Will this case affect other cities? Memphis is ""a whole other barrel of fish"" that differs from the Washington, Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago cases because it's a state court case, not a federal one, according to Nunn. ""It's not going to have any impact outside of Tennessee, even if you saw the same sort of gambit in a different state,"" Nunn said.

The Oregon Health Authority officials and Gov.","In a case affecting Oregon, a California judge has extended a ban on the Trump administration sharing the private information of health care enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement.

On Tuesday, Judge Vince Chhabria in the Northern District of California ordered that his preliminary injunction from August be extended until Jan. 5. The ruling is intended to block a controversial push by the administration from using information provided to Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income residents, for arresting and deporting people.

News of the federal push to give the data to Homeland Security over the legal and ethical objections of federal Medicaid officials broke in June amid the continued federal immigration campaign that has often targeted people based only on the color of their skin. The arrests and deportations have sparked fear, constitutional and civil rights concerns and a global backlash affecting health care providers, as well as widespread protests and litigation.

Chhabria’s order is the latest development in a lawsuit brought in July by California, Oregon and the 20 other states to permanently stop the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from sharing personal information with the Department of Homeland Security. In August, when announcing the first temporary ban on that data sharing and use, Chhabria noted that federal administrations have had a longstanding policy of only using Medicaid information for health care services and not for immigration enforcement. He said before changing that policy, the administration needed to conduct a thorough review.

He said the temporary ban on the data sharing and use of the information by immigration agents would stay in place while the lawsuit continued or until 14 days after the administration conducted a thorough review.

Chhabria’s latest decision prevents immigration authorities from using information they’ve already obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for immigration enforcement and the transfer of new data.

The decision marks a temporary victory for the 22 states involved in the lawsuit: California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

In Oregon, Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s office welcomed the judge’s latest order to extend the ban until January, saying that would give the parties time to submit more arguments.

“We filed this lawsuit because the federal government’s plan to share Medicaid data with immigration authorities is unlawful. We’re asking the court to block this data-sharing policy before it can do more harm,” a statement said. “Oregonians deserve to know their health care information isn’t being used as an immigration enforcement tool.”

But it’s unclear what will happen over the long term. At the end of November, the Trump administration published a notice in the Federal Registry, saying it intends to resume that data sharing with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“(ICE) contemplates requesting from CMS available biographical, contact and location information, though ICE reserved the right, in a specific case, to consider requesting other information on a case-by-case basis,” the notice said.

It indicated its review was over.

“CMS is publishing this notice solely to inform interested parties of its decision to provide information to ICE consistent with federal law,” the notice said.

The notice apparently did not satisfy the judge that CMS has followed his earlier order that a thorough process had taken place.

Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday.

Data already shared

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services already has shared data from California, Washington, Illinois and Washington, D.C., with immigration authorities. CMS has also issued demands to Oregon for information about residents without legal residency who are receiving Medicaid benefits.

Traditional Medicaid, which provides free physical, mental and dental benefits, is largely funded by federal dollars and excludes most immigrants, but 12 states — Oregon, California, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont and Maine — and Washington D.C. spend state dollars to provide free health care benefits to low-income children without residency documentation, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Six states among them, Oregon, California, Washington, Colorado, Illinois and New York, as well as Washington D.C. also extend the same benefits to adults.

In Oregon, 1.4 million people receive Medicaid benefits, including more than 105,000 who qualify through Healthier Oregon, the state-funded program for people regardless of their immigration status.

At the end of July, Oregon declined to share extensive data about these Medicaid enrollees with CMS. The Trump administration responded in August with a new campaign, demanding that Oregon and other states verify the immigration status of those enrolled in Medicaid.

The Oregon Health Authority officials and Gov. Tina Kotek have said they would not turn over any personal information that would violate privacy laws.

The agency and the governor’s office did not respond by Wednesday afternoon to a request for comment about the extended court order and pressure from the Trump administration.

Immigration officials have stepped up enforcement in Oregon, and those campaigns have had a negative effect on immigrants, including those with legal residency. Though clinics that largely serve immigrants and people on the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s Medicaid program, have told The Lund Report that they continue to see the same demand for health services from immigrants, the administration’s campaign has provoked widespread anxiety and fear.

And that has taken a toll on providers and patients, with people starting to cloister at home for fear of running into ICE agents.",https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-12/PatientInformationIllustration_Shutterstock.jpg?itok=Uc55dqbE,N,,2025-12-11 21:57:22.229415

A spokesperson also shared general information about the ways the agency partners with ICE.","The Florida Highway Patrol could be seen this week teaming up with federal immigration enforcers to stop and question people in the landscaping business, pulling over their trucks along busy Broward County highways.

FHP is part of a state-federal partnership that the state is mandating local jails and law enforcement to participate in. And NBC6 Investigates found evidence in newly released data that a much larger share of those recently snagged in the so-called 287(g) efforts are people with no criminal history.

Social media was flooded this week with images of men working in the landscaping business being handcuffed after FHP troopers pulled over their trucks, and then federal agents moved in to take some away.

Among them was the husband of a woman who spoke exclusively to Telemundo.

“It’s an impact. We still haven’t processed it — neither my children nor me,” said, asking we conceal her and her husband’s identities.

“My children don’t want to go to school. They’re afraid. They don’t want me to be away from them because they’re scared of being left alone,” she said. “And they ask me, ‘Mom, if you leave, what’s going to happen to us?’”

The father of those children – who the wife said had a valid work permit – was just the latest in what has been thousands of immigration arrests made with the assistance of state and local law enforcement, as required under those 287(g) agreements.

FHP alone had, by Aug. 23, apprehended more than 3,400 of what it calls “illegal aliens” in Florida, according to a court filing by its deputy director, Joseph Harrison.

Data on ICE apprehensions in Florida released last week and analyzed by NBC6 Investigates shows a much larger share of those detained under 287(g) programs had no criminal convictions as the state ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts with the feds.

And this week’s operations have instilled fear among other landscaping businessmen, like “Jalen,” who, with his wife and four employees, do landscaping and tree services.

When he saw the video of a fellow landscaper being arrested Tuesday, he said he thought “he was arrested like a real criminal…. They were arresting only people who go to work.”

Jalen said he and his workers have valid work permits but remain afraid because he says ICE is not honoring them. “They have work permit, but they say, ‘No, that's fake. Come here.’”

And when they do, some go into detention, including at Florida’s Everglades detention camp, what the state calls Alligator Alcatraz.

The NBC6 analysis of the ICE data – obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project – found more than 800 men detained there were associated with the 287(g) program.

Statewide, the chart below shows the number of such arrests, in blue, remained relatively low, averaging 98 a month beginning in September 2023, with 4% of them having no criminal histories.

That changed in April 2025, as the state geared up its immigration crackdown with the feds.

The data show 287(g) detentions increasing to an average of 400 a month, peaking at 1,009 in September, when the share of them with no criminal conviction or charges pending topped out at 37%. The data ends on Oct. 15.

Seeing what the state and feds are doing, Jalen said, has spread fears to his three children and wife, with whom he used to work.

“But we're not going (to work) together anymore because if they take both, what about my children?” he asked.

The wife of the man detained Tuesday said he had a valid work permit as well.

“I beg God and the authorities for his release,” she pleaded. “My family is destroyed, my children are destroyed, and we are good people. We are not criminals. We didn’t do anything wrong — just came to this country to work.”

Jalen said his business is effectively shut down this week, but his clients know what is happening and understand. If people who keep lawns mown and hedges trimmed continue to be taken into custody, he predicted prices will have to rise for consumers.

NBC6 reached out to ICE about their operations this week and the increasing share of people with no criminal histories being detained but received no response to those questions.

FHP just told NBC6 they were “conducting routine traffic enforcement,” without providing specifics.

Border crossings sit at a record low nearly a year into his second administration and a new wave of immigration enforcement is dividing families inside the U.S.

Federal officials and their local law enforcement partners are detaining tens of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants. Detainees are moved repeatedly, then deported, or held in poor conditions for weeks or months before asking to go home.

The federal government was holding an average of more than 66,000 people in November, the highest on record.

During the first Trump administration, families were forcibly separated at the border and authorities struggled to find children in a vast shelter system because government computer systems weren't linked. Now parents inside the United States are being arrested by immigration authorities and separated from their families during prolonged detention. Or, they choose to have their children remain in the U.S. after an adult is deported, many after years or decades here.

The Trump administration and its anti-immigration backers see “unprecedented success"" and Trump’s top border adviser Tom Homan told reporters in April that “we’re going to keep doing it, full speed ahead.”

Three families separated by migration enforcement in recent months told The Associated Press that their dreams of better, freer lives had clashed with Washington’s new immigration policy and their existence is anguished without knowing if they will see their loved ones again.

For them, migration marked the possible start of permanent separation between parents and children, the source of deep pain and uncertainty.

Antonio Laverde left Venezuela for the U.S. in 2022 and crossed the border illegally, then requested asylum.

He got a work permit and a driver’s license and worked as an Uber driver in Miami, sharing homes with other immigrants so he could send money to relatives in Venezuela and Florida.

Laverde's wife Jakelin Pasedo and their sons followed him from Venezuela to Miami in December 2024. Pasedo focused on caring for her sons while her husband earned enough to support the family. Pasedo and the kids got refugee status but Laverde, 39, never obtained it and as he left for work one early June morning, he was arrested by federal agents.

Pasedo says it was a case of mistaken identity by agents hunting for a suspect in their shared housing. In the end, she and her children, then 3 and 5, remember the agents cuffing Laverde at gunpoint.

“They got sick with fever, crying for their father, asking for him,” Pasedo said.

Laverde was held at Broward Transitional Center, a detention facility in Pompano Beach, Florida. In September, after three months detention, he asked to return to Venezuela.

Pasedo, 39, however, has no plans to go back. She fears she could be arrested or kidnapped for criticizing the socialist government and belonging to the political opposition.

She works cleaning offices and, despite all the obstacles, hopes to reunify with her husband someday in the U.S.

Yaoska’s husband was a political activist in Nicaragua, a country tight in the grasp of autocratic married co-presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo.

She remembers her husband getting death threats and being beaten by police when he refused to participate in a pro-government march. Yaoska spoke on condition of anonymity and requested the same for her husband to protect him from the Nicaraguan government.

The couple fled Nicaragua for the U.S. with their 10-year-old son in 2022, crossing the border and getting immigration parole. Settling down in Miami, they applied for asylum and had a second son, who has U.S. citizenship. Yaoska is now five months pregnant with their third child.

In late August, Yaoska, 32, went to an appointment at the South Florida office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Her family accompanied her. Her husband, 35, was detained and failed his credible fear interview, according to a court document.

Yaoska was released under 24-hour supervision by a GPS watch that she cannot remove. Her husband was deported to Nicaragua after three months at the Krome Detention Center, the United States’ oldest immigration detention facility and one with a long history of abuse.

Yaoska now shares family news with her husband by phone. The children are struggling without their father, she said.

“It’s so hard to see my children like this. They arrested him right in front of them,” Yaoska said, her voice trembling.

They don’t want to eat and are often sick. The youngest wakes up at night asking for him.

“I’m afraid in Nicaragua,” she said. “But I’m scared here too.”

Yaoska said her work authorization is valid until 2028 but the future is frightening and uncertain.

“I’ve applied to several job agencies, but nobody calls me back,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to me.""

Edgar left Guatemala more than two decades ago. Working construction, he started a family in South Florida with Amavilia, a fellow undocumented Guatemalan migrant.

The arrival of their son brought them joy.

“He was so happy with the baby — he loved him,” said Amavilia, 31. “He told me he was going to see him grow up and walk.”

But within a few days, Edgar was detained on a 2016 warrant for driving without a license in Homestead, the small agricultural city where he lived in South Florida.

She and her husband declined to provide their last names because they are worried about repercussion from U.S. immigration officials.

Amavilia expected his release within 48 hours. Instead, Edgar, who declined to be interviewed, was turned over to immigration officials and moved to Krome.

“I fell into despair. I didn’t know what to do,” Amavilia said. “I can’t go.”

Edgar, 45, was deported to Guatemala on June 8.

After Edgar’s detention, Amavilia couldn’t pay the $950 rent for the two-bedroom apartment she shares with another immigrant. For the first three months, she received donations from immigration advocates.

Today, breastfeeding and caring for two children, she wakes up at 3 a.m. to cook lunches she sells for $10 each.

She walks with her son in a stroller to take her daughter to school, then spends afternoons selling homemade ice cream and chocolate-covered bananas door to door with her two children.

Amavilia crossed the border in September 2023 and did not seek asylum or any type of legal status. She said her daughter grows anxious around police. She urges her to stay calm, smile and walk with confidence.

“I’m afraid to go out, but I always go out entrusting myself to God,” she said. “Every time I return home, I feel happy and grateful.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d9aecfca-b767-4567-ba73-e5422cbf64a5/wirestory_76e1c6239c1522aae010590195f97db3_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-11 22:56:19.483728

The event, moderated by Harvard Law School lecturer Aminta Ossom, featured the Center’s four Senior Human Rights and Foreign Policy Fellows, all of whom previously held top human rights roles in the U.S. government under the Biden administration.

Ossom opened by asking how Americans have shaped international human rights norms and how those norms have, in turn, shaped the United States. Kelly Fay Rodríguez, who served as the U.S. Special Representative for International Labor Affairs, said “there’s a real, blatant tension historically and today when you think about the U.S. and the global human rights system.” The United States helped build human rights institutions, she noted, yet “the U.S. government, corporations, and actors have also played a role either as perpetrator or enabler of some of the worst human rights atrocities.” The normalization of certain practices, including abuses in the immigration system, she said, contributes to “the kind of moments we’re experiencing now.”

There’s a real, blatant tension historically and today when you think about the U.S. and the global human rights system. –Kelly Fay Rodríguez

Maggie Dougherty, formerly a senior director for international organizations at the National Security Council, emphasized the extent of U.S. involvement in the United Nations system. Americans, she said, continue to hold influential positions in Geneva because of a long history of academic and diplomatic engagement, even in periods like the present when the U.S. government reduces participation. She also noted that the United States has historically been the largest financial contributor to U.N. human rights bodies.

Jessica Stern, who served as the U.S. Special Envoy for LGBTQI+ rights, described how that influence shapes global norms. She said the country’s political and financial contributions have given it significant weight at the United Nations and warned that with the rise of authoritarianism and decline of multilateralism, “the U.N. is in crisis, and international human rights norms are more needed than ever.”

We were still in the thick of Jim Crow, yet we had the U.S. leading the creation of a document saying every human being has universal rights and dignity,” –Desirée Cormier Smith

Desirée Cormier Smith, the former U.S. Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice, drew attention to historical contradictions reaching all the way back to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). “We were still in the thick of Jim Crow, yet we had the U.S. leading the creation of a document saying every human being has universal rights and dignity,” she said. She recalled that the NAACP submitted a petition to the United Nations in 1947 detailing racial terror in the United States and that, according to many historical accounts, government officials resisted the petition because it would “embarrass the United States” as it promoted the adoption of the UDHR and sought to position itself as a counterpoint to Soviet opression.

When Ossom asked how international standards affect people’s daily lives, Dougherty offered the example of the U.N. Human Rights Council investigation into abuses in North Korea. The inquiry relied on interviews with refugees outside the country and produced documentation that informed international legislation and sanctions. For Dougherty, it demonstrated how global mechanisms can illuminate conditions in places where direct access is blocked.

Cormier Smith pointed to the limits of such mechanisms when governments place reservations on human rights treaties. The United States has often included provisions stating that treaties are “non-self-executing” or otherwise non-binding, which she argued has weakened their actual impact. Fay Rodríguez added that multilateral bodies often serve as the only safe platform for workers and activists facing repression, citing Burmese workers who use the International Labour Organization to raise concerns about forced labor.

“The U.N. is in crisis, and international human rights norms are more needed than ever.” –Jessica Stern

In response to Ossom’s question about progress, panelists listed recent developments connected to international norms. Fay Rodríguez pointed to labor union activism promoting global human rights for marginalized groups outside their own countries. Cormier Smith highlighted Peru’s constitutional recognition of Afro-Peruvians, adopted in 2024, and noted that international mechanisms helped bring visibility to longstanding advocacy efforts. Stern cited India’s decision to strike down colonial-era sodomy laws, a ruling that referenced U.N. interpretations of privacy and equality, and pointed to the Human Rights Council’s first resolution on the rights of intersex people, which condemned unnecessary surgeries.

The conversation also offered critiques of the international system. Cormier Smith described civil society frustrations, including limited speaking time, inadequate translation services, and the high cost of attending U.N. sessions in Geneva during the first meeting of the U.N. Permanent Forum on People of African Descent. Dougherty criticized the Human Rights Council’s election structure, noting that “China sits on the Human Rights Council. It’s insane, but that’s how it is,” referring to the closed regional slates that allow governments with abusive records to win uncontested seats and thereby weaken the Council’s credibility. Fay Rodríguez and Stern said some governments challenge established human rights norms, and multilateralism itself, to avoid accountability, including on issues such as the right to strike or abuses against minority groups.

“China sits on the Human Rights Council. It’s insane, but that’s how it is.” –Maggie Dougherty

Audience questions turned to the future of human rights under another Trump administration. Stern described steep staffing reductions within the State Department’s human rights bureau and warned of a shift toward a “natural rights” framework that, she said, redefines key protections as political preferences rather than legal obligations. She argued that advocates must focus on defending existing standards.

Cormier Smith urged civil society and academia to remain active internationally so that partners abroad do not feel abandoned, while Fay Rodríguez and Dougherty emphasized documentation and local organizing as essential tools, regardless of political conditions.

In closing the event, Ossom drew together several themes raised by the panelists. She noted that past movements show how progress often meets backlash and that earlier generations used moments of repression to build civic institutions that strengthened rights over the long term. She encouraged listeners to see the current period in that historical frame and emphasized that the work ahead requires persistence and collective effort. The panelists echoed that perspective, pointing to the resilience of past movements as evidence that human rights protections can be rebuilt and expanded even in difficult times.",https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2025-12/Human%20Rights%20Day%20Webinar%20%282%29.png,N,,2025-12-12 01:56:18.464692

Multiple U.S. citizens across the Twin Cities report being detained by ICE, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to call on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to review the incidents in a letter on Wednesday.

His letter came just hours after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O’Hara publicly raised concerns about the detentions.

The latest case involves Mubashir, who didn’t want his last name shared. He’s a U.S. citizen who said he has no criminal record and was detained by ICE on Tuesday.

Cell phone video shows ICE agents confronting him in the back stairwell of a Minneapolis restaurant.

“I didn’t know who it was. I just saw that person, that mask, just come out the car, sprint at me full speed,” Mubashir said.

In the video, agents can be heard asking Mubashir why he was running. He responds that he wasn’t running and repeatedly tells them he is a U.S. citizen and can show his passport.

“I told him, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen.’ He [ICE agent] didn’t seem to care,” he said.

Another video shows Mubashir handcuffed near an unmarked vehicle. He said he was taken to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, held for a few hours, and then released.

“All I did was step outside as a Somali American, and I just got chased by a masked person,” he said. “I don’t want to come outside anymore because all I did was go and try to get some food. I can’t even get food without being tackled and put in a chokehold.”

At a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the incident.

“They deserve the same rights as every other American because they are American citizens. They’ve got the full support of this city government behind them,” Frey said.

When asked what Mayor Frey would say to people who argue ICE is “just doing their job,” the mayor responded, “I’m not sure that some of them know what job they’re doing,” he said. “This is the kind of deal where you’re randomly stopping somebody on the street because they look Somali or Latino.”

Immigration attorney Gloria Contreras Edin, based in St. Paul, said these incidents are legally complicated.

She pointed to a September Supreme Court ruling allowing ICE agents to consider race, ethnicity and accents during immigration stops.

“So unfortunately, when someone’s skin color alludes that this person may be from another country, then an ICE officer can confront the individual,” she said. “It is legal, according to the Supreme Court.”

Edin said citizens can still be temporarily detained during encounters even if they immediately state their citizenship.

“Immigration Law allows immigration agents to arrest anyone whom they believe are in violation of immigration laws,” she said. “Even though they say they’re a U.S. citizen, they may be temporarily detained until they can prove it.”

She mentioned U.S. citizens can also be detained under other circumstances.

“If a U.S. citizen is confronting an officer, if a U.S. citizen is obstructing the officer from doing their job, if a U.S. citizen is assaulting an officer, then that U.S. citizen may be detained,” she said.

Still, Edin said the recent incidents raise concerns.

“I am just appalled, and I am saddened and heartbroken that folks who are U.S. citizens have to be worried and scared about being arrested. I’m advising people to carry a copy of their passport with them,” she said.

Edin mentioned she’s witnessed some ICE arrests in a ‘calm controlled and safe setting.”

Addressing recent detentions of U.S. citizens, the attorney noted that ICE can face consequences if they make an unlawful arrest.

Employees inside told the Banner the van’s driver had been stopped by armed men in unmarked vehicles, who handcuffed him and took him away. The armed men, the employees said, were not wearing uniforms or badges indicating that they were with a government agency. On social media, word spread that the unidentified men were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“We are horrified that something this vile happened outside Sip,” read a post on the shop’s Instagram account. “We urge all of our friends to be careful — this ambush happened out in the street just a little while ago.”

It was one of multiple incidents that fueled alarm and uncertainty among immigrant communities and advocate networks throughout the day as reported ICE sightings came from East and South Nashville. Rapid response operations like Music City MigraWatch posted photos on social media of what they believed to be ICE vehicles and the empty work vans left behind by the people they’d taken. One post showed a white van pulled over by unmarked vehicles with red and blue flashing lights on Bell Road.

But getting clear information about what had happened or was happening — who was taken and by whom — was complicated, given the agency’s tactics. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Highway Patrol — which collaborated with federal agents during a large operation in Nashville in May — told the Banner they were “not aware of any such activity.” A spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department also said its officers weren’t involved in the incidents reported on social media Wednesday. ICE officials could not be reached for comment.

The Spanish-language news outlet Nashville Noticias reported Wednesday evening that at least eight people had been taken into custody by ICE agents in various locations, citing relatives of the people who’d been detained.

Ashley Warbington, an advocate with Music City MigraWatch, told the Banner the group first received a tip around 6:30 a.m. from a person who believed they’d seen ICE agents in Nippers Corner in South Nashville. A volunteer named Carleen, who asked that her last name be withheld, said she and her husband drove to the area to verify the report and saw unmarked vehicles with flashing blue and red lights surrounding a red work van in the center lane of a five-lane road. By the time they turned around, the van had been moved to a nearby parking lot and was unoccupied. She did not see anyone being detained. She said the group had flagged one of the vehicles as having “been associated with ICE in the past” and was further convinced of the affiliation by the red and blue lights.

Warbington said that volunteers and community members have been following Music City MigraWatch’s reports of ICE activity on social media accounts and alerting the group when they believe they see the same vehicles in other areas.

One of the group’s volunteers arrived at Sip Café three minutes after receiving a call about suspected ICE activity there, but the reported agents were already gone. It’s not clear how many people were detained at that location.

Warbington said Wednesday was an unusually active day for ICE watchers in Nashville.

“We’ve had days similar in the past couple of weeks, but it has been in Lebanon, for example, or in Franklin,” she said. “This was mostly in Davidson County.”

The apparent incident at Sip Café, she said, had set off a flurry of rumors and reports of ICE activity elsewhere in the East Nashville area, most of which could not be verified. Music City MigraWatch received at least 20 calls, she said, on top of numerous text messages and social media messages.

“My fingers are tired from texting, I’ll just say that,” she said.

Zach Young, who represents the Inglewood area on the Metro Nashville Public Schools board, said he heard from another public official that a suspected ICE vehicle had been spotted near an elementary school in the neighborhood. He said he informed the principal, who was “already standing in his office looking out the window.”

Young said school officials are “very well versed” in policies for responding to a law enforcement inquiry, including seeking counsel from Metro lawyers.

According to Young, it appears that the suspected ICE vehicle was only coincidentally in the area and not targeting the school.

“It would be terrible for ICE to conduct any sort of enforcement around a school because we want families to think of schools as a safe space,” he said.

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — In what’s become an increasingly volatile deployment, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have made more than 400 arrests in Minnesota since so-called Operation Metro Surge began this month, an ICE spokesperson said.

NBC News was granted exclusive access to the operation Wednesday in the frigid Twin Cities, where the wind chill dropped well below freezing.

“The frigid temperatures means that people aren’t out and about as much, so it makes it a little tougher,” said Marcos Charles, the acting executive associate director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Details of the federal surge, which include around 100 ICE agents from around the country, had been sparse, prompting backlash, protests and threats. ICE requested that NBC News conceal the identities of most of its agents, who said protestors had tried to block in their vehicles at scenes and had aggressively tailed them, even attaching Apple AirTags to their vehicles to track their movements.

Throughout the day, NBC News witnessed multiple protestors going up to unmarked ICE vehicles and blowing whistles at the agents. One agent related an anecdote of an ICE agent’s evading a tailing car by using his military ID to enter a military base.

Trial and error

On Wednesday, agents left their staging area at a federal building in St. Paul by 6 a.m. The first target was a Somali immigrant who ICE said had been in the U.S. illegally since 2019 and had a previous conviction for criminal sexual conduct. The agents, in several vehicles, surrounded a home outside Minneapolis — and waited.

Within the hour, they made contact with someone inside the home: the man’s wife, who claimed he was staying elsewhere. Agents moved on to their next target, another Somali immigrant, but couldn’t locate him.

“It is not an operation targeting the Somali community,” Charles said. “We’re looking for people that are here illegally.”

Three hours later, after a burst of activity over the agency’s radio transmissions, another team, including agents from Florida and Texas, gathered around a residence, hoping to make an arrest and trying to determine whether their target was home. A crowd began to gather.

“Let’s get out of there,” an ICE official said over the radio with a curse and a sigh.

The operation was a constant, unrelenting sequence of trial and error, using previously gathered intelligence about targets to make arrests. Ideally, officers said, a person is taken into custody without incident. Many attempts don’t pan out, the day’s events showed and agents said, either because the suspect isn’t home or because other obstacles get in the way, such as persistent protestors or property managers who restrict ICE personnel’s movements within any given area.

At one location, ICE agents surrounded an apartment building attached to a business on the ground level. They were searching for a 68-year-old Somali who’d been convicted of criminal sexual contact with a minor and who agents believed was upstairs. The property manager wouldn’t let the ICE agents enter, so they had to abandon the plan.

Around noon, the agents arrived back at their staging area to regroup while another transport team brought in three undocumented immigrants from Ecuador who had just been taken into custody.

In a brief interview, one of the men, 32, told NBC News that he’d been arrested while he was trying to find work shoveling snow. He acknowledged he’d been convicted of drunk driving three years earlier but insisted he remained in the country to work and care for his family. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he’d be deported or how soon.

By the afternoon, agents got word that another ICE team had tried to stop a man in his car near his home in Burnsville, Minnesota. He apparently escaped and ran inside the home. The agents consulted with a government lawyer and got a warrant allowing them to forcefully enter the home. About an hour later, a special response tactical team with a battering ram broke through the door.

The initial target had fled the home, but ICE said another undocumented immigrant from Honduras who had been staying at the home was taken into custody. During the operation, protestors gathered nearby. One of them rammed two ICE vehicles with his car, Charles said, and was arrested.

‘Filthy dirty, disgusting’

Even though ICE agents insist they’re not specifically targeting the Somali community, President Donald Trump has been ramping up his criticism of Minnesota’s Somali community, by far the largest in the country. The vast majority are here legally, and many are U.S. citizens. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from railing against their African homeland.

“We always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster,” he said again Tuesday in Pennsylvania. “Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Trump escalated rhetoric after convictions involving dozens of members of Minnesota’s Somali community who, during the pandemic, stole millions of dollars in taxpayer money, some of it from programs providing meals to low-income children. The majority of those charged in the fraud are U.S. citizens.

State and city leaders in Minnesota have strongly argued that the scandal shouldn’t be used to insult all Somali immigrants.

“The mistakes of a few individuals can never be used to generalize or stereotype an entire community,” said Imam Hassan Jamma, executive director of the Islamic Association of North America.

A top adviser to Trump, however, isn’t limiting his attacks to a few individuals. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller — the administration’s immigration policy architect — was direct in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday in his xenophobic criticism of African countries specifically.

“You see with a lot of these immigrant groups, not only is the first generation unsuccessful — again, Somalia is a clear example here — not only is the first generation unsuccessful, but you see persistent issues in every subsequent generation,” Miller said. “You see consistent high rates of welfare use, consistent high rates of criminal activity, consistent failures to assimilate. This shouldn’t be a surprise.”

“There are people all over the world that are great people,” Miller added. “But you look at the society — if Libya keeps failing, if the Central African Republic keeps failing, if Somalia keeps failing, if these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself: If you bring those societies into our country and then give them unlimited free welfare, what do we think is going to happen?”

Growing backlash

“The biggest misconception is that we’re out there just randomly arresting people, which we’re not,” Charles said.

Firm numbers about how many “collateral arrests,” as DHS officials have described them, have occurred have been difficult to determine. During NBC News’ roughly eight hours with ICE, fewer than a dozen people were arrested despite not being the initial targets of the operation. They just happened to be at the scene when agents showed up.

In Minneapolis, as in other major cities where the Trump administration has surged resources, ICE has encountered concerted pushback from local leaders who have accused it of mistakenly taking U.S. citizens into custody.

On Wednesday, Minneapolis’ mayor and police chief alleged at a news conference that ICE agents wrongfully arrested a U.S. citizen because he looked Somali.

Standing alongside the city leaders, Mubashir, 20, who wanted to be identified only by his first name, said he was on his lunch break Tuesday when a masked man running full speed tackled him and pushed him into a restaurant.

“The agent then, at one point, he never identified himself, he didn’t say, ‘ICE, stop.’ I feel like I was getting assaulted, I was getting kidnapped,” Mubashir said.

DHS said ICE officers were speaking to someone nearby who they suspected was in the country illegally.

“At that time, a second male individual walked out of a nearby restaurant, turned around, and fled from law enforcement,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to NBC News. “Having reasonable suspicion--as protected under the U.S. Constitution--officers gave chase and caught up with the individual, who violently resisted officers and refused to answer questions.”

She added that the officers “temporarily detained” the person because a large crowd had gathered, presenting a threat to the officers’ safety.

“Once officers finished their questioning, he was promptly released,” McLaughlin wrote. “Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. Under the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses ‘reasonable suspicion’ to make arrests.

The raids led to dozens of arrests across southern Arizona last week.

Taco Giro’s management confirmed that seven of its locations, primarily in and around Tucson, remained closed indefinitely following the raids, with the closures affecting staff, customers and surrounding communities, according to Green Valley News.

Newsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Taco Giro for comment via email outside office hours.

Why It Matters

The closures of several Taco restaurants are a byproduct of the Trump administration’s blueprint for mass deportations and strict immigration enforcement, which targets businesses employing undocumented workers. Business leaders have expressed concerns that widespread raids can exacerbate labor shortages in key sectors, disrupt local economies, and unsettle communities that rely on immigrant labor.

What To Know

Cesar Rodriguez, director of operations for Taco Giro, told Green Valley News that about 10 percent of the company's employees were detained by ICE.

He told the outlet that three Taco Giro locations have reopened, in Tucson on Valencia in Tuscon, Casa Grande and Sierra Vista, and that the chain plans to gradually reopen additional restaurants as it recruits and trains staff. He also said that the Country Club of Green Valley location lost about six employees, even though no agents ever visited that site.

""Basically, they corralled everyone in the homes where they were living, which was a couple of houses. And they came into the establishment to verify documentation and some questioning items what they were investigating on and pretty much that was it,"" Rodriguez told Green Valley News.

Rodriguez told the outlet that none of the detained employees have contacted the company, and their whereabouts remain unknown.

ICE Homeland Security Investigations Arizona and federal partners executed 16 search warrants in southern Arizona on December 5, part of what the agency described as a years‑long investigation of a ""transnational criminal organization involved in labor exploitation, tax violations, and immigration violations.""

The operation spanned multiple jurisdictions, including homes and businesses, and resulted in 46 arrests, according to ICE officials.

Rodriguez said accusations had been made that undocumented employees had been paid ""cash under the table.""

""There were a lot of false allegations that we were drug smuggling and child trafficking. It was just ridiculous,"" he added.

The presence of federal agents at several Taco Giro locations also sparked protests by residents and activists, some of whom attempted to block federal vehicles and question agents about the operation, according to the Marshall Project.

Video from local outlets show federal officers deploying chemical agents such as pepper spray and pepper balls to disperse crowds outside the restaurants.

During the confrontations, U.S. Representative Adelita Grijalva (D‑Ariz.), whose congressional district includes parts of Tucson, said she was pepper‑sprayed by an ICE agent when she approached the scene and identified herself while seeking information about the raids.

DHS disputed the Democratic lawmaker’s account, saying Grijalva was near someone who was sprayed and criticizing protestors for ""obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.""

What People Are Saying

Taco Giro wrote in a post on social media: ""Our restaurant will be temporarily closed. While we take a short pause to make a few necessary adjustments so we can continue offering the warm service and unique flavors you love, we truly appreciate your patience and your continued support during this time. We'll be ready to welcome you back very soon with the same love, passion, and flavors that always make you feel at home. Thank you for being part of our family.""

Acting Special Agent in Charge Ray Rede said in a press release issued by ICE: ""This multiyear investigation that targeted TCOs alleged to be involved in human smuggling, human trafficking derived from peonage resulted in the shutdown of the restaurants.

""These enforcement actions have unequivocally disrupted this criminal organization’s ability to exploit our lawful labor and system of commerce. This agency will not stand for it and those seeking to continue such practices are on notice — there will be more enforcement operations in Arizona.""

Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyer was also contacted for comment.

Mr Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the US illegally as a teenager.

An immigration judge in 2019 ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.

He was returned to the US under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

His lawsuit in federal court claims Mr Trump's administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.

Meanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, he is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States.

Additionally, he is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling.

He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive.

A spontaneous crowd surrounded the agents, but by the time local immigration advocates and organizers got there, it was too late. Authorities had already detained several street vendors. Two weeks ago, though, it was the protesters who surprised ICE.

Organizers had a feeling the authorities might take advantage of Thanksgiving weekend to stage their next raid. Their suspicion grew when volunteers who were patrolling Canal Street noticed early that morning on November 29 that there were more vehicles on the road than usual. They also observed that many cars were moving toward a garage nearby. “We would be able to tell that a raid was going to happen just based on the movement around Federal Plaza, because that is ICE headquarters,” says Samantha, a young organizer who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation from the federal government. Activists alerted each other in Signal chats to come to the garage, then issued a call for action to the public on social media. Samantha grabbed a mask, a hat, and 25 whistles and rushed downtown from Brooklyn.

By the time she arrived, about 50 people were blocking the garage’s exit. They locked arms and chanted, “ICE out of New York!” She handed out whistles to passersby, some of whom joined in. “Once people see with their own eyes, Oh, shit it’s happening here in my city, the feeling is a lot different than seeing it on their Instagram Reels or TikTok feed,” she says. Protesters dragged trash cans and wood pallets to put in the federal agents’ path. Others stood in front of government vans, stopping and slowing their progress all the way to Holland Tunnel, about a mile away. Julie DeLaurier, 69, locked eyes with one federal agent and said, “You don’t have to do this.” By the time the NYPD arrived a half-hour later, organizers say the protest had grown to some 200 people. Police eventually cleared a path for ICE to leave, using pepper spray on protesters and arresting more than a dozen people.

“These were all delay tactics — we didn’t interfere with any arrests — but the delays allowed word to spread, and they got no one. We did good work,” DeLaurier says.

DeLaurier and others were prepared to block federal agents after attending community events and protests organized by Hands Off NYC, a volunteer-run coalition that has become a key part of a broad, decentralized effort to defend New York from the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown seen in other cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and most recently New Orleans. The coalition includes two of the city’s largest immigrant-rights organizations, New York Immigration Coalition and Make the Road New York. Hannah Stauss, a co-founder of Hands Off NYC, says the group has trained thousands of volunteers in recent months; interest has recently surged to the point where more than 800 people are on a wait list. “Sometimes you trade high security for the ability to scale,” she says. “We always assume that we are infiltrated.” When Hands Off NYC isn’t training, its leaders are organizing, along with coalition members, mass demonstrations such as the city’s most recent No Kings protest.

When the first, successful Canal Street raid happened, immigration advocates got there largely after ICE had already detained street vendors, says Stauss, and there were half as many people as there were a month later. She attributes the faster response to the second operation, in part, to increasing vigilance across the city through more frequent neighborhood patrols performed by local residents. “A lot of it is growing to a point where ICE can’t move quietly in our city,” she says.

The patrols are mainly a response to changing tactics by authorities who are increasingly targeting immigrants on the streets. Activists are particularly vigilant about windows when immigrants are most vulnerable: returning to or leaving work, picking up or dropping off their children at school. It appears federal agents are venturing beyond the courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza, where they have detained immigrants there for routine court hearings. The move to the streets has opened up more creative possibilities to fight back. “You’re more likely to be around people who care,” says one protester who was on Canal Street last month. “If you’re in a federal building and trying to stop a kidnapping, there’s not a ton of people around you that you can call out for … in the same way you could on a street.”

On Saturday, about 1,000 participants signed up for a Hands Off NYC anti-ICE training at a Pentecostal church in Brooklyn. Nancy Campau, an 82-year-old grandmother, always saw herself as “kind of a goody two-shoes.” She came to the training to learn how to step in and document and distract federal agents if she witnessed them trying to detain one of her neighbors. “It would be hard, but I would,” she says. Going forward, she will wear a whistle around her neck to alert people to raids and will offer to walk children to school if their parents are fearful of ICE.

The crowd at Saturday’s training was mostly white. “To put it frankly, old white people have a lot of time, and they’re really angry,” Stauss said. “Having somebody that looks like your grandmother out there, shouting ‘shame’ or out there blowing her whistle, is really important.” Stauss also said they have community buy-in from coalition members, like the NAACP and the Street Vendor Project. “Part of it is about asking how we can show up to support them, instead of asking people who are at greater risk to show up on the streets,” she says.

Trainers ran through scenarios, like ICE grabbing a parent who is dropping their child off to school. They laid out best practices for reporting, recording, and documenting ICE actions, including “using all your personal strength to not use expletives to describe what’s happening.” They cracked open studies about what it takes to topple authoritarian regimes and shared what they learned from other cities, such as adopting Chicago activists’ ideas to use whistles and to report activity on a hotline.

One of the biggest lessons Hands Off NYC learned is the importance of a neighborhood-led rapid-response structure. “That is definitely something we learned from other cities, where we felt like we’re maybe a little behind,” says Hae-Lin Choi, another co-founder of Hands Off NYC. Keya Chatterjee, executive director of Free DC, explains that Washington activists realized they weren’t able to react fast enough without training residents in neighborhoods being targeted by ICE. “This is not the kind of situation where you can have a centralized group that can get to where the issue is,” she says.

Activists in New York say more than 500 people patrol at least 20 neighborhoods daily, led by an autonomous patchwork of people who operate separately from public-facing groups like Hands Off. One of them is Samantha, who signed up for a shift to patrol part of Bushwick on Monday evening, checking multiple Signal chats for updates. She usually walks alone, but others are patrolling nearby at the same time. “The more eyes you have in all areas, the more likely you are to suspect things and the quicker people can converge to get together if there’s a sighting,” she says.

At every intersection, Samantha looks both ways, trying to spot clues. In Bushwick, she says federal agents often huddle at the parking lots by White Castle and Food Bazaar before any enforcement action. They also transfer the immigrants they detain into cars at these locations. Those on ICE patrol look for cars and vans moving in groups, especially if they aren’t personalized, have tinted windows or no license-plate covers, or are double or illegally parked. This night, there is no sign of ICE activity, although the corner of Irving Avenue and Harman Street, right outside a public school, had remnants of a previous encounter. A large warning is painted in red on a white concrete road barrier: “ICE ABDUCTION HERE,” accompanied by the date, September 13.

Samantha has been demonstrating since she was in middle school, first over gun control and climate, then joined Black Lives Matter marches in 2020. More recently, she was part of the pro-Palestinian student-encampment movement. The years of experience make her a seasoned veteran at a young age, but even she is terrified about what the Trump administration reportedly has planned for people like her. A leaked Justice Department memo noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi is ordering the FBI to “compile a list of groups or entities engaging in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism,” including opposing law and immigration enforcement and harboring “extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders.”

“We know ICE is not going to slow down,” Samantha says. “It’s undeniably scary — but people are more likely to be courageous when they have a resilient social structure that has their back.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/923/d9d/a0055703a58fb9752c6a9aed9bd1ab898d-Canal-Ice-lead.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 20:56:35.725332

“I personally don’t think I see any violation of state law,” said Hansen, a Republican.","LINCOLN — Two days after a Democratic Nebraska lawmaker publicly criticized Republican Gov. Jim Pillen’s administration for denying her entrance to a controversial state-run ICE detention facility, all 49 officially nonpartisan state senators received an invite to a group “walkthrough” next week.

Notice of the Dec. 15 group tour of the former McCook Work Ethic Camp, which recently was converted to a jail for migrants awaiting deportation by the federal government, came via email Wednesday from State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, who heads the Legislature’s Oversight Committee.

Dorn told the Nebraska Examiner that conversations about a tour had been ongoing with State Sen. John Arch, speaker of the Legislature, and Pillen’s team since State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha notified him in mid-November that she was turned away from the McCook detention center.

Dorn, a Republican, said all senators were notified late Wednesday afternoon after details had been solidified.

Cavanaugh still concerned

Cavanaugh said Thursday a group tour does nothing to calm her biggest concern — that legislative oversight authority embedded in state law was disregarded when she was turned away.

She is uncertain whether she will participate, saying a pre-scheduled walkthrough won’t offer a “real view of what the day to day looks like.” If she goes, Cavanaugh said, it would be to address part of her intent: to show detainees that elected officials are paying attention.

The group invite came also as State Sen. Margo Juarez separately notified state officials of her intent to visit the McCook facility on Dec. 15. The Democratic lawmaker from South Omaha said she formally alerted the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Dec. 8, and prior to that had left messages at the McCook center.

She said she had yet to hear back when she received Dorn’s email.

Juarez said she believes legislators have the right under state law to visit the state-run facility unannounced, but won’t pass up the group tour opportunity.

“My goal is to get in there,” she said.

Juarez had visited the McCook center in September when it was winding down as WEC, and vowed to return in the future to check out conditions.

Cavanaugh said she had yet to get a response to her Monday letter in which she asked Dorn and State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, to defend the legislative branch’s authority.

Nebraska lawmaker was twice denied entry to McCook ICE jail, calls it law violation

Her letter underscored the state law that says legislators can enter a state facility “at any time.” She asserts that the Pillen administration violated state law in turning her away twice, Nov. 12 and 13.

Both Dorn and Hansen on Thursday said a lawmaker’s access becomes questionable in the case of the McCook jail because it now houses federal, not state, detainees. Dorn said he expects legislation to be introduced in the coming legislative session that would clarify the access question.

Dorn and Hansen in separate interviews said they would reexamine Cavanaugh’s Monday letter to determine if further response is needed. Dorn said he had communicated with Cavanaugh a few times since she was rejected for entry to the McCook facility.

“I personally don’t think I see any violation of state law,” said Hansen, a Republican. “But we’re still looking at the situation to make sure.”

No media

Cavanaugh argues that the state contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot supersede state law. A Pillen spokesperson said previously that the governor’s team interprets the law differently, particularly as it relates to the McCook facility and the contract with the federal government.

Thursday, Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said senators who want to be part of the tour are required to complete and submit the appropriate federal form to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services by the close of business Friday, so the forms can be transmitted to representatives of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE prior to the Dec. 15 visit.

“Now that the detention facility has been up and running successfully for some time, it is a good time for senators to come and see first-hand the operational aspects of the detention facility,” Strimple said.

Asked whether news media can participate, the Governor’s Office said the tour is exclusive to state senators.

Migrants began to arrive last month to the former WEC, a facility that remains owned and staffed by the state. The federal government is paying Nebraska for its use as a Midwest ICE hub. Up to 300 undocumented men and women eventually could be held there as they await deportation, state officials have said.

The contractual arrangement came after the Pillen administration reached out to President Donald Trump’s administration to offer assistance in the president’s ramped up immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts.

The Dorn email says senators will be responsible for their own transportation to McCook, and a representative of the Governor’s Office will be at the facility as well.

Dorn plans to participate in the tour. Hansen said he had a prior engagement.

“Any potential visitors who have not submitted the appropriate paperwork will not be admitted to the facility,” the email said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wec_thumbnail-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 22:56:34.765511

Donald Trump may push to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, according to a Washington Post report citing six unnamed people familiar with the discussions.

The newspaper said the changes could include reducing oversight of marijuana and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers. The moves would not legalize or decriminalize marijuana, but rather reduce obstacles to research and help support legal businesses, according to the report.

A White House official told the paper that no final decisions have been made, and other US agencies did not immediately comment. The report noted that the president previously said he was “looking at reclassification”, saying, “Some people like it, some people hate it.”

Trump signs AI executive order meant to block state restrictions

Trump has signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that aims to block laws that limit AI and restrict states from regulating the technology.

At a signing ceremony, the president praised AI companies investing in the US, saying, “If they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you could forget it … We want to have one central source of approval.”

Trump’s order calls for the US attorney general to establish an AI “litigation task force” that would be responsible for challenging state laws. Republicans earlier this year failed to pass a moratorium meant to prevent new state AI laws for ten years.

State leaders and civil liberties groups across the country have pushed back against Trump’s order, arguing it would empower corporations while hampering efforts to reduce the harmful consequences of AI.

Trump declines to commit to US attendance at Ukraine meeting

Donald Trump declined to commit that the US would send a representative to participate in Ukraine talks in Europe this weekend.

“We’ll see whether or not we attend the meeting,” the president said in the Oval Office, Reuters reported. “We’ll be attending the meeting on Saturday in Europe if we think there’s a good chance. And we don’t want to waste a lot of time if we think it’s negative.”

His waffling comes after he hinted earlier this week that he could walk away from supporting Ukraine and called for the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to accept his proposal to cede territory to Russia.

Trump’s press secretary earlier today said it was “still up in the air” whether the US believed “real peace can be accomplished”, adding, “The president is extremely frustrated with both sides of this war, and he is sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.”

Trump claims pardon for Tina Peters, but doesn't have power to free her

Donald Trump wrote on social media that he was granting a “full pardon” for Tina Peters, a convicted Colorado election clerk, even though he does not have authority to pardon or free her as she is serving a sentence on state charges.

Peters, the former Mesa county clerk, was convicted last year for her role in breaching election data in search of evidence of fraud and sentenced to nine years.

Trump has repeatedly called for her release and threatened earlier this year to take “harsh measures” if she was not freed. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform this evening: “Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the ‘crime’ of demanding Honest Elections. Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!”

Presidential pardons, however, do not apply to state convictions. Jared Polis, Colorado’s Democratic governor, who does have clemency authority in her case, has said he won’t pardon her.

Trump warns of land strikes on Venezuela drug shipments

Donald Trump again suggested that the US would “soon” carry out land strikes on drug shipments in Venezuela, which would mark a dramatic escalation of his campaign against Nicolás Maduro.

Defending his administration’s strikes against boats that allegedly have ties to drug trafficking, the president claimed “drug traffic by sea is down by 92%”. The source and context of that figure was unclear, and Trump continued by saying: “Nobody can figure out who the 8% is.” He then added: “We’ll start that on land, too. It’s going to be starting on land pretty soon.”

Trump has repeatedly warned of potential land attacks, but his administration has not offered further details. His comments come as his administration is facing increasing scrutiny over its seizure of an oil tanker.

Trump attacks Indiana GOP Senate leader: 'I hope he loses'

Donald Trump has criticized Rod Bray, the Republican state senate leader of Indiana, after GOP representatives rejected a redistricting measure.

The White House had supported the proposed redrawing of the congressional map, with the president threatening to support primary opponents of Republicans who voted against redistricting.

Asked about the vote, Trump responded: “I wasn’t working on it very hard. It would’ve been nice … You had one gentleman … Bray, whatever his name is, I heard he was against it. He’ll probably lose his next primary. I hope he does. He’s done a tremendous disservice.”

Republican infighting over Indiana redistricting vote

Republicans in Indiana and across the country are sparring over the state GOP’s rare break with Donald Trump with lawmakers’ vote against redistricting.

Earlier today, Republican state lawmakers rejected an effort to redraw Indiana’s congressional map, with a plan that would have added two more GOP-friendly seats to Congress.

Mike Braun, Indiana’s GOP governor, wrote on social media after the vote that he was “very disappointed that a small group of misguided State Senators have partnered with Democrats to reject this opportunity to protect Hoosiers with fair maps and to reject the leadership of President Trump”. The decision, he said, would “carry political consequences”, adding he would work with Trump to “challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers”.

Meanwhile, Kevin Kiley, a GOP congressman from California, applauded Indiana Republicans for “taking a principled stand against mid-decade gerrymandering and rejecting the ‘eye for an eye’ mentality that has caused this redistricting war to spin out of control”. Kiley’s district is due to be redrawn under California Democrats’ redistricting that was launched in response to Texas’ gerrymandering.

Earlier this week, Trump threatened to support primaries against Republicans in Indiana who opposed redistricting. GOP state senator Spencer Deery criticized the outside pressures, telling the AP, “The federal government should not dictate by threat or other means what should happen in our states.”

JD Vance, the vice president, attacked Rod Bray, the Senate leader in Indiana, accusing Bray of telling the administration he would support redistricting while fighting against it behind the scenes.

“That level of dishonesty cannot be rewarded, and the Indiana GOP needs to choose a side,” Vance said.

Indiana Republicans’ rejection of a redistricting effort that would have favored the GOP marks a major break from Donald Trump and comes after the president threatened to back primary opponents for those who didn’t support the redrawn congressional maps.

“Anybody that votes against Redistricting, and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C., will be, I am sure, met with a MAGA Primary in the Spring,” Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday, the day before the vote. “Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.”

Late last month, Michael Bohacek, a Republican Indiana state senator, announced he was opposing redistricting after Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to insult a political opponent. Bohacek, whose child has down syndrome, said he was an “unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities” and the president’s “choices of words have consequences”.

Heritage Action, a conservative 501(c)4 associated with the group behind Project 2025, also suggested before the vote that Indiana Republicans would suffer if they didn’t support the redrawn maps, writing on social media, “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”

Indiana Republicans vote down redistricting in major blow to Trump

Sam Levine

Indiana Republicans have rejected an effort to redraw the state’s congressional map, a stunning and blunt rebuke of Donald Trump and Republican efforts to reconfigure the state’s congressional districts to add two more Republican-friendly seats.

The measure failed 19-31, with 21 Republicans joining 10 Democrats in rejecting the new maps.

US targets Nicolás Maduro's family with new sanctions

The US has issued new sanctions targeting the family members of Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, and six crude oil tankers, Reuters reports.

The US treasury department announced sanctions against three nephews of Maduro’s wife and oil tankers and shipping companies allegedly linked to them.

The targeted oil tankers “have engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”. The sanctions come as the Trump administration has dramatically escalated its pressure campaign against Maduro, including with the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker.

Democrats and others have criticized the administration over its boat strikes and the seizure, warning the US was “sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.

Trump administration creates new militarized zone along California border

Victoria Bekiempis

The US’s southern border is poised to become more militarized following an announcement by Trump administration officials that armed forces would now oversee 760 acres of public land for a three-year period.

The US Department of Interior said in a statement that jurisdiction over this acreage – located in California’s San Diego and Imperial counties – would be transferred to the US navy “to establish a National Defense Area to support ongoing border security operations”.

Expansive portions of the border region have been deemed militarized zones since April. This designation permits US military members to capture migrants and those whom they allege are illegally on US army, navy or air force bases, according to the AP. The classification also enables more criminal charges which, in turn, could mean greater prison terms. AP notes that more than 7,000 service members have been sent to the US border, as well as military surveillance equipment.

'Shoving Americans off a cliff': Democrats condemn ACA vote

Democrats have forcefully condemned Republicans over the failure to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits, with votes today that threaten to increase healthcare costs to unaffordable levels for millions of Americans.

The US Senate earlier rejected competing proposals that would have addressed the approaching expiration of subsidies for plans under the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Premium tax credits for roughly 21.8m enrollees of the plans are on track to expire by the end of December. A bill supported by Democrats laying out a three-year extension failed, with only four Republicans supporting.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, said:

Senate Republicans just shoved the American people off the side of a cliff with no parachute and with an anchor tied to their feet. Republicans just blocked the Democrats’ bill for a clean, simple extension of the ACA tax credits, the last chance they had to ensure people’s premiums do not skyrocket in the coming months.

Republicans, Schumer added, were “fighting like hell to kick people off insurance … [and] give sweet giveaways to billionaires and the ultra-rich”.

Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, said the Republicans’ proposal was a “cruel joke”. Republicans, she said in a video message, “never wanted to lower healthcare costs in the first place”.

Magaziner featured one such veteran, Sae Joon Park, over Zoom. In June, the U.S. Army veteran and green card holder self-deported to South Korea after Magaziner said he was issued a removal order related to drug possession charges and failure to appear in court from over 15 years ago.

The panel's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, opened the hearing with a scathing personal rebuke of the DHS secretary before urging her to resign from her post.

""Instead of deploying homeland security grants to protect churches and synagogues, you handed your friends a $220 million contract so they could follow you around the country with a camera,"" Thompson claimed in an apparent reference to a Pro Publica report. Thompson accused Noem, who currently resides in a military home typically reserved for the U.S. Coast Guard's top admiral, of living ""rent free in a taxpayer-owned property that is supposed to be reserved for military leaders.""

""Every penny that you spend on yourself represents the blood, sweat and tears of hardworking Americans who expect their tax dollars to be spent on homeland security, not promoting you and your interests,"" Thompson said.

The ranking member later pressed Noem on who gave asylum to the Afghan national who has now been accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. ""Your D.H.S. approved the asylum application,"" Thompson told her. Noem repeatedly said that the vetting of the suspect occurred during the Biden administration.

During the questioning, Thompson called the shooting an ""unfortunate accident,"" prompting Noem to fire back that it was ""a terrorist attack.""

Following the Nov. 26 attack, the Department of Homeland Security halted processing of Afghan visas and froze decisions on asylum applications. The administration has also indefinitely suspended entry for foreign nationals from 19 countries ""of concern"" that were included in President Trump's travel ban.

Taking stock of recent European policy developments in the field of asylum and migration, most prominently the recent Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council meeting, requires a clear head as new lows have been reached in terms of respect for fundamental rights. Here is an overview.

1. Balancing responsibility and solidarity: the forgotten ‘humanity’ factor

The overall ambition for solidarity in 2026 has been set at 21,000 relocations or other solidarity efforts or EUR 420 million in financial contributions. The countries that the European Commission (EC) found to be “under migratory pressure” and which can therefore benefit from the solidarity pool are Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain. A separate group of countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia and Poland) have been identified as facing a “significant migratory situation” due to the cumulative migratory pressure of the previous years. They have the possibility to request a full or partial deduction from their contributions to the solidarity pool. A third group of countries considered to be “at risk” of migratory pressure will have priority access to the EU Migration Support Toolbox which includes assistance by EU agencies and support from EU funds.

While it is positive that the EC has recognised most Mediterranean countries as being under pressure, the extent to which they can actually benefit from solidarity measures will be dependent on the evaluation of whether their asylum and reception systems suffer from systemic shortcomings, and this has been postponed until 2026 when the full system will become operational. For countries such as Italy and Greece, this means that they are expected to resolve obstacles to accepting people returned under Dublin; in Italy’s case, a declared suspension of incoming Dublin transfers.

The agreement on the solidarity pool is positive as it finally signals that the solidarity side of the Pact is receiving attention. Whether the promise of solidarity will be delivered on in reality remains to be seen. Likewise, whether the question of assessing the shortcomings of EU member states’ (MS) systems goes beyond the limited question of Dublin transfers to a more comprehensive assessment of compliance with EU asylum rules is also uncertain.

Of course, the establishment of the solidarity pool has to be seen in the overall context of the Pact and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR) which preserves the system in which the allocation of responsibility rests largely with the MS of first entry and, therefore, inherits many of the structural problems of the current Dublin system. ECRE’s recent statistical update on Dublin highlights its various flaws. The solidarity mechanism is nothing more than an attempted corrective layer on top of an unfair system; the chance of a fundamental overhaul of the responsibility rules has been missed.

While allowing different forms of contribution to count as solidarity may make the mechanism more workable, it also (1) dilutes what “solidarity” means in practice and may reduce the impact for both applicants and MS under pressure; and (2) provides for a quasi-permanent negotiation of MS’ contributions on which the solidarity mechanism relies, which is not favourable to mutual trust between them. Focusing on the forms of solidarity that involve individuals would be key to addressing this. Both the primary form of solidarity (i.e. relocations) and responsibility offsets should remain the priority (rather than defaulting to financial or capacity support). Ensuring transparency on the choices made and criteria used by MS is equally important. For instance, financial contributions or capacity support could be directed to support border control or develop infrastructure, rather than improving reception or access to rights.

2. The strategy of limiting access to protection for refugees in Europe is further embodied

A general approach was found for all of the legislative proposals on the agenda of the recent JHA Council meeting. The files under discussion were (1) two amendments to the Asylum Procedure Regulation (APR) that seek to mainstream and expand the “safe country” concepts (i.e. safe country of origin (SCO), safe third country (STC) and first country of asylum) as instruments for harmonising and accelerating asylum processing across MS and, (2) the proposal for a Return Regulation.

2.1 Safe countries and territories: a theory of relativity

In substance, the Council added new aggravating measures to the various major issues already identified with the amendments to the APR. These include the presumption that all EU candidate countries and several additional third countries are considered “safe” despite well-documented human rights risks for several groups of their nationals, and the weakening of both the connection criterion and of appeal rights.

New additions regarding SCOs include:

adjustments to the exclusion criteria for SCOs that would allow MS to treat applications from nationals of Türkiye and Ukraine under accelerated procedures;

a process allowing the EC to assess if a country of origin is partially safe (i.e. specific parts of its territory) or only for certain categories of people (provided the categories are clearly identifiable);

a clarification that the 20% rule – a ground for procedural acceleration of applications made by nationals who do not reach a 20% recognition rate – relates to a recognition rate at first instance;

allowing MS to frontload SCO as a ground for acceleration from the date of approval of the text.

New additions regarding STCs include:

a broad definition of transit (passing through or being at the border or in a transit zone would constitute transit);

the possibility of applying the STC concept not only based on an agreement between MS but also on a non-binding arrangement providing it contains provisions requiring the examination of the merits of any request for effective protection (irrespective of the case processing modalities, including simplified, group or prima facie procedures);

application of the STC concept to unaccompanied children in case either the transit or connection criteria applies;

the lack of an automatic right to remain on the territory of a MS when an appeal is lodged against an inadmissibility decision when the applicant is holding a protection status in another MS.

2.2 Agreements on returns: humanity at a loss or lost humanity

The EC’s proposal for a Return Regulation already marked a significant step backwards by weakening safeguards, introducing more punitive measures and further narrowing the space for rights-based approaches within the EU return framework (see ECRE’s detailed analysis on the proposal here and a summary here). The Council’s position suggests that MS should be able to effectively frontload a series of provisions (e.g. expansion of countries of return, establishment of return hubs and mutual recognition of return decisions) while the rest of the Regulation would only come into effect two years later.

The list of provisions on which the wide political consensus was achieved could fill a reader with dread:

potentially indefinite immigration detention, up to 30 months per MS, including for children;

optional alternatives for detention, limited to three options ((1) financial guarantees by returnees; (2) electronic monitoring; and (3) measures provided by national law;

no requirement to determine the country of return in the return decision;

broadened grounds and scope for issuing an entry ban;

far-reaching duties on individuals to continuously demonstrate co-operation (e.g. pending financial penalties, reduction in support intended for reintegration after removal and even criminal detention);

broadened search and visit powers for authorities, including possibility to confiscate personal items, home inspections…;

weakened assessment of non-refoulement risk during appeal process (e.g. no more ex officio obligations, possibility of effective removal while an appeal is pending, possibility of return decisions being issued even where there is a risk of violation of the principle of non-refoulement (provided the effective removal is suspended)).

The European Parliament’s (EP) Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) adopted its position on the APR amendments in early December with the support of a coalition of the European People’s Party (EPP) and the far-right groups, the so-called ‘Venezuela coalition’, effectively breaching the cordon sanitaire that has existed in the EP for decades. For both the SCO and the STC file, the EP’s position is extremely close to that of the Council, leaving very little hope that any of the multiple risks to people’s ability to access to asylum in Europe will be addressed during the trilogue.

That said, there is an ongoing attempt to challenge the EP’s draft reports in next week’s plenary which should be supported by all MEPs who are committed to protecting access to asylum in Europe.

On the Return Regulation, the Council’s position diverges significantly from the EC’s proposal and even more so from the EP’s draft report which is currently being discussed in the LIBE Committee. The hope here is that the rapporteur will seek to form a majority with progressive parties.

3. Denying the fundamental rights, manufacturing the disenfranchised

Keeping a clear head, one would state the obvious: while MS claim the European ‘new comprehensive approach to migration (…) should go hand in hand with full respect for fundamental rights’, the means they consistently choose to achieve their declared goals are what have been documented for decades as the most detrimental to fundamental rights: extended deprivation of liberty as a default setting, accelerated procedures, limited access to legal support and reduced appeal rights, detection of vulnerabilities by means of a written form, jeopardising legal certainty by allowing partial frontloading… This is the final demonstration of many MS’ strong taste for performativity when it comes to upholding the fundamental rights of people on the move.

We are all left with the question of the sheer compatibility of these provisions with regional and international legal frameworks, from Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights to which the EU is a party, including the whole the EU acquis and the very ius cogens nature of the non-refoulement principle. Not to mention the question of implementation and how all actors involved at national level will manage to operate the more than 5000 pages of new legislation by 12 June 2026, amidst the multiple options for frontloading bits and pieces of each new legal instrument.",https://ecre.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-ecre-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-11 18:57:49.789153

Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan this spring with obstruction and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. They allege she showed 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom through a back door when she learned federal authorities were in the courthouse looking to arrest him.

Dugan is set to stand trial beginning Monday in the latest show of force in the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown. She faces up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts.

Here’s what to know about the case, jury selection and the trial:

FBI: Angry Dugan orchestrated escape attempt

According to an FBI affidavit, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the United States from Mexico in 2013. Agents learned that he had been charged in state court with battery in March and was scheduled to appear in front of Dugan on April 18.

Agents traveled to the courthouse to arrest Flores-Ruiz after the hearing. A public defender noticed the agents in the corridor and told Dugan’s clerk about them. Dugan grew angry, according to the affidavit, declared the situation “absurd” and approached with another judge. Dugan argued with the agents over whether their warrant was valid and told them to speak to the chief judge.

Dugan returned to her courtroom, told Flores-Ruiz to come with her and led him and his attorney out a back jury door to the public corridor outside the courtroom, the affidavit says. Agents on their way back from the chief judge’s office spotted Flores-Ruiz, but he made it outside. He was eventually captured after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November that he had been deported.

Dugan defenders scouring jury pool for bias

Democrats insist President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to its immigration crackdown.

The administration, for its part, has been vilifying Dugan on social media. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of her being led out of the courthouse in handcuffs and the Department of Homeland Security posted that Dugan has taken the term activist judge “to a whole new meaning.”

Dugan told police she found a threatening flyer from an anti-government group at her home and at her mother and sister’s homes four days after Flores-Ruiz was captured.

Dugan’s attorneys have said they’re worried publicity about the case has tainted the jury pool. They sent a questionnaire to prospective jurors this fall in an effort to gauge their political involvement and leanings, asking whether they belong to political organizations, what radio shows and podcasts they follow, and what stickers, signs and patches they have on their cars, water bottles, backpacks and laptops.

Attorneys on both sides have already agreed to strike 44 prospective jurors, online court records show. A group of 40 prospective jurors was scheduled to show up Thursday morning at the federal courthouse in Milwaukee and fill out yet another questionnaire about whether their views have changed since they completed the first survey. Attorneys plan to spend the day questioning them in person.

The lawyers are prepared to bring in more prospective jurors on Friday if necessary.

Questions of immunity and protocol

Dugan’s defense team has argued that she’s immune from prosecution because she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore had “no consciousness of wrongdoing, no wrongfulness, no deception,” according to their filings.

Her attorneys tried to persuade presiding Judge Lynn Adelman to dismiss the case in August on those grounds. The judge refused, saying that there’s no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution.

Dugan also has argued that she was following protocols and did not intend to disrupt agents. According to her arguments, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley sent out a draft policy on immigration arrests in the courthouse about a week before Flores-Ruiz was arrested. The policy barred agents from executing administrative warrants in nonpublic courthouse areas and required court personnel to immediately refer any immigration agents to a supervisor, which Dugan did.

Dugan further contends that Ashley denied the agents permission to arrest Flores-Ruiz in the courtroom or the hallway. The agents then abandoned their plan to arrest him in the building and instead followed him outside so they could arrest him on the street, according to Dugan.

“(Dugan) was trying to ascertain, and follow, the rules,” her attorneys argued ahead of the trial.

Under federal guidance issued Jan. 21, immigration agents may carry out enforcement actions in or near courthouses if they believe someone they are trying to find will be there.

Immigration agents are generally required to let their internal legal office know ahead of time to make sure there are no legal restrictions, and are supposed to carry out arrests in nonpublic areas whenever possible, coordinate with court security and minimize impact on court operations.

Clinton appointed the judge presiding over the case

President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, appointed Adelman to the federal bench in 1997. A Wisconsin native, he served as a state senator for 20 years. He also worked as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Wisconsin and as a Columbia University Law School researcher. He’s now 86 years old.

He struck down Wisconsin’s voter photo identification law in 2014, calling it an unfair burden on poor and minority voters. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the law later that year, however.

Adelman also wrote an article in 2020 accusing the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts of eroding democracy.",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2025/05/Dugan-051525-AP-w.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 23:56:58.058962

Noem and Joe Kent, a former congressional candidate now running the National Counterterrorism Center, both highlighted immigration from Afghanistan as among the threats facing the homeland after an Afghan who served in a U.S.-backed unit shot two National Guard members, killing one.

“The terrorist who shot them was an Afghan national who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome,” Noem said before listing the recent arrests of two other Afghans, calling the matter among the “despicable examples that unfortunately are becoming too common.”

Kent called the arrival of Afghans “probably the top terrorist threat that we face right now.”

Kent said 2,000 Afghans who entered the U.S. after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan have terrorist ties and claimed without evidence that prior vetting done on the shooter was used as a “ruse.”

“The individual was vetted to serve as a soldier in Afghanistan, and that vetting standard was used by the Biden administration as a ruse to bring him here. Had we followed the standard operating procedures for Special Immigrant Visas, that individual and none of the Allies Welcome people would have come to America. That’s on Joe Biden,” he said.

Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), the top Democrat on the panel, disputed that the accused shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, wasn’t vetted, noting that he underwent a second round of review when he was approved for asylum under the Trump administration.

However, Thompson came under criticism himself for initially saying the shooting was an “unfortunate mistake.”

“You think that was an unfortunate accident?” Noem said with dismay. “It was a terrorist attack.”

“It was an unfortunate situation,” Thompson said, “but you blamed it solely on Joe Biden.”

“I don’t want to bring perjury charges against you, but I’m of the opinion that the Trump administration DHS [Department of Homeland Security], your DHS, approved the asylum application,” he added.

Thompson was later taken to task by Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) for his comments.

“Mr. Chairman, that was a murder that took place in D.C. It was not an unfortunate incident. And those comments are effing disrespectful,” he said.

Disputes over immigrants

The Charles Dickens novel “A Tale of Two Cities” featured prominently as both parties sparred over whether the Trump administration’s immigration policies should be celebrated or denigrated.

“The Democrats see it as the worst of times, but I see it really as the best of times,” said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who argued poor control of the border by the Biden administration allowed unvetted migrants to enter the country.

“That was the worst of times. Let me go to the best of times — most secure border I’ve seen in my 22 years in Congress, and I’ve dealt with this for a long time. … The daily crossings are 95 percent down from the prior administration. That’s the best of times — zero catch and release.”

Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) riffed on McCaul’s framing.

“This is ‘A Tale of Two Cities.’ Under Secretary Noem, the Trump administration — you’re going after the worst of the worst criminals. … The problem is 70 percent of the people you’ve arrested have no criminal record. You’re going after noncriminal immigrants,” he said.

Noem defended the Trump administration’s immigration policies, once again describing high immigration levels as an “invasion” and listing the risks of immigration as the greatest threat facing the country.

“Mr. Chairman, what keeps me up at night is that we don’t necessarily know all of the people that are in this country, who they are and what their intentions are,” Noem said.

“What keeps me up at night is the individuals that are in this country that wish to do us harm.”

Kent also attacked migrants when asked by Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) about those who “openly reject assimilation.”

“We simply won’t have a country anymore as we know it,” Kent said.

Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) accused Noem of “fueling bigotry” with her comments and by taking illegal actions to broadly target immigrants.

“Today’s hearing is supposed to be about worldwide threats. But Madam Secretary, under your watch, the threat is coming from inside the building,” said McIver, who is currently facing what she has described as politicized charges after she was arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

“Because when DHS, the department charged with keeping Americans safe, is called breaking the law, lying to the American public, systematically dismantling oversight, fueling bigotry and targeting vulnerable communities, trust is broken.”

Noem was confronted a the hearing by guests invited by Democrats who were intended to highlight the risk of Trump administration immigration policies.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.), for example, invited a South Korean man who served in the U.S. military but who was deported back to South Korea under President Trump. He also invited the veteran spouse of a woman who is a legal permanent resident who remains in detention facing deportation after writing two bad checks 10 years ago.

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) also accused the Trump administration of violating the law by arresting those showing up in immigration court for their asylum hearings, noting that those who seek the protection have legal status.

And Rep. Julie Johnson (D-Texas) said immigration officers were conducting racial profiling.

“You can’t just snatch somebody walking into a coffee shop because of the color of their skin,” she said. “There’s no probable cause for that.”

FEMA and Noem’s early exit

Noem left the “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland” hearing early, telling the committee she had to depart to attend a meeting of the FEMA Council as the Trump administration seeks to diminish the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Thompson later moved to subpoena Noem to reappear before the panel, saying she shirked her duties and may have even lied about needing to attend the FEMA meeting.

“I understand on good information that the FEMA council meeting was canceled so there was no need for her to go,” Thompson said, referencing the meeting to determine the future of the agency.

“She was a liar with no respect for congressional oversight.”

Noem left the witness table a few minutes after noon for the FEMA Council meeting that was slated to begin at 1 p.m., which The Hill independently verified had been canceled.

Thompson mentioned Noem also spent time in the committee’s anteroom after leaving the witness table, suggesting she did not immediately head to her next meeting.

“The Secretary found out at 12:26 p.m. that the meeting was cancelled,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Republicans voted down Thompson’s motion to again call her before the committee.

Noem had said earlier in the hearing that she would be heading to the FEMA Council meeting.

“I have to actually leave this hearing early, because the FEMA Review Council is giving their report today on suggestions for changes to FEMA. I have to co-chair it, but I will be leaving soon to have to go do that,” Noem said.

A struggle to answer questions over antifa

Michael Glasheen, a longtime FBI agent serving as operations director of the National Security Branch, struggled to answer questions from Thompson about why the Trump administration had determined antifa was a domestic terror organization.

“We share the same view. When you look at the data right now, you look at the domestic terrorist threat that we’re facing right now, what I see from my position, is that’s the most immediate violent threat that we’re facing on the domestic side,” Glasheen said.

Thompson asked where the group was headquartered and then when Glasheen hesitated asked, “Where in the United States does antifa exist?”

“We are building out the infrastructure right now,” Glasheen said.

“What does that mean?” Thompson asked. “We’re trying to get information. You said antifa is a terrorist organization. Tell us, as a committee, how did you come to that? Do they exist? How many members do they have in the United States as of right now?”

“Well, that’s very fluid,” Glasheen said.

“Sir, I just want you to tell us — if you said antifa is the No. 1 domestic terrorist organization operating in the United States, I just need to know where they are … how many people have you identified with the FBI that antifa is made of,” Thompson asked.

“Well the investigations are active,” Glasheen responded.

Thompson suggested the FBI had failed to establish why those opposed to fascism deserved to be labeled as domestic terrorists.

“Sir, you wouldn’t come to this committee and say something you can’t prove. I know you wouldn’t do that,” Thompson said, “but you did.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/1__2066.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-11 21:57:07.874509

It is striking that human rights are not mentioned once in the National Security Strategy’s section on China.
But our current trajectory not only deprioritizes human rights in our diplomacy but externalizes escalating domestic human rights abuses – from unlawful transfers of migrants to arbitrary detention in third countries to extrajudicial killings in Pacific and Caribbean boat strikes.","Thank you, Scott, for your human rights leadership over decades and your all too kind words. It’s an incredible honor to follow in your footsteps and those of the other remarkable Tex Harris Awardees. Meeting Tex Harris soon after I joined the State Department was a formative experience that shaped the trajectory of my diplomatic career, from being a third-tour human rights officer in Hafez al-Asad’s Syria to my most recent role in the Biden Administration. Inspired by Tex’s example, let me be forthright about the state of human rights diplomacy today.

We are at an existential crossroads for the defense of freedom and democracy around the world, including in the United States, and how we respond now will have a direct impact on American security, prosperity and well-being for years to come. This is not a question of red vs blue, the heartland vs the coastal cities, or MSNow vs FoxNews, It’s also not the exclusive purview of Washingtonians like myself. In fact, the trajectory of democracy and human rights globally matters to every American, regardless of one’s politics, faith, background, zipcode, or Spotify Wrapped playlist. And the warning signs are too abundant to ignore, such as the recently released U.S. National Security Strategy that deprioritizes human rights in U.S. diplomacy – except when it comes to our European allies – and embraces fringe Great Replacement white nationalist narratives on migration. We’ve seen longtime Allies questioning U.S. staying power that underpinned transatlantic security for the last 75 years; the spectacles earlier this year of the United States exiting the UN Human Rights Council and boycotting its own Universal Periodic Review; and the dismantlement of the U.S. Agency for International Development and decimation of the State Department bureaus responsible for human rights, refugee policy, and multilateral affairs, alongside elimination of the global women’s issues and global criminal justice offices and conflict stabilization bureau– all moves that dealt a debilitating blow to peace and security worldwide.

All this is happening as we approach the two-decade mark in a global democratic recession, per the dedicated experts at Freedom House, a storied, non-partisan organization whose life-saving support for human rights defenders under siege globally has been eviscerated by U.S. funding cuts. And make no mistake, the United States has joined the ranks of nations in democratic decline, according to respected, independent international observers like CIVICUS, as the rule of law, freedoms of expression and association, and separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution have been under near-daily assault since January 20.

So my question for all of us is, do we stand by, admire the problem, look the other way, or try and build a better, bipartisan alternative? As someone who devoted much of her adult life working to advance U.S. national security abroad – under 6 Presidents, Democrat and Republican – allow me to make the case for the latter. And at a moment when some question the cost-benefit or legitimacy of standing up for freedom abroad, I’d like to focus on three dimensions of U.S. human rights leadership where a renewed, bipartisan approach is crucial to anchoring American security, prosperity and well-being for years to come.

Number One: U.S. human rights leadership makes Americans safer by keeping authoritarians in check and rallying Allies and partners in common cause to push back. Ronald Reagan recognized this in his famous speech at Westminster in 1983 when he made the case for promoting an “infrastructure for democracy” overseas resulting in the creation of the National Endowment for Democracy, which has provided critical support to thousands of human rights champions around the world and earned strong bipartisan support since then.

In my most recent diplomatic role, traveling to over 60 countries, I saw first-hand the heavy toll of authoritarian overreach in every region of the world, alongside the promise of collective pushback. Take the devastating impact of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which generated Europe’s worst humanitarian and refugee crisis since World War II, upended global food and energy security from Africa to the Americas, and involved Russian abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to fates unknown. But the Kremlin’s aim of erasing Ukraine’s democracy overnight in 2022 was thwarted, thanks to the courage of the Ukrainian people and government and the determination of the U.S. and other partner nations to support them. Much of that crucial U.S. support for Ukrainian refugees, civil society, anti-corruption champions, and prosecutors of Russian war crimes was jeopardized by U.S. funding cuts this year, contravening bipartisan Congressional appropriations.

Adding insult to injury, the Trump Administration incorporated Russian positions on territorial concessions and NATO into its 28-point peace plan for Ukraine and won Kremlin plaudits for its just released National Security Strategy. Putin could not have asked for a better gift as he approaches the four-year mark of his further invasion, as the White House endorses Russian land grabs that he couldn’t secure by force, despite the steadfast help of his fellow autocrats in Tehran, Pyongyang, and Beijing.

Keeping autocrats in check is also a vital strategic aim of U.S. China policy, where bipartisan convergence made possible legislative breakthroughs like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and the Tibet Resolve Act, both aimed at holding the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to account for its brutal suppression of religious and ethnic minorities. I saw this bipartisan dynamic play out as a Commissioner of the Congressional Executive Commission for China (CECC) — a longtime platform for courageous human rights activists, scholars and journalists to call out CCP abuses inside and beyond China. But rather than bolster their efforts, the United States terminated USAID support that helped democratic Tibetan institutions grow and flourish in exile, eliminated the prospects of Chinese nationals fleeing religious or political persecution to obtain refugee protections here, and silenced the broadcasts of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia that delivered uncensored truth to hundreds of millions listeners in China and other closed societies for decades. It is striking that human rights are not mentioned once in the National Security Strategy’s section on China. Again, President Xi could not have asked for a better gift, particularly at a moment when the PRC is flexing its muscle to menace Taiwan – an issue that that same Strategy reduces to supply chains, ignoring the strategic import of Taiwan’s tremendous democratic trajectory.

This brings me to the second strategic dimension: U.S. human rights leadership makes Americans more prosperous by leveling the playing field for American workers, promoting rule of law which helps businesses protect innovation and resolve disputes peacefully, keeping kleptocrats and transnational criminals from stealing public resources or extorting American companies, and welcoming newcomers fleeing persecution who quite literally enrich our society. In other words, by prioritizing workers’ rights, rule of law, anti-corruption and transparency as core elements of U.S. foreign policy, bipartisan champions can help create greater opportunity for Americans at home, in addition to doing the right thing.

I’ve seen this win-win dynamic play out all over the world, from concerted U.S. government, NGO and private sector engagement that helped eliminate forced labor from the cotton sector in Uzbekistan, create new frameworks for garment worker safety in Bangladesh, and recover over $1billion in stolen assets in Malaysia. All of these anti-trafficking and anti-corruption efforts have been upended by the evisceration of U.S. foreign assistance in these areas and the decision to discontinue enforcement of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, despite a strong body of bipartisan legislative backing, from the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 to the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act of 2024.

The prosperity dividend also applies to U.S. efforts to welcome refugees, a multi-generational endeavor with a proud bipartisan and community-based tradition. My organization, Human Rights First, helped secure unanimous Senate adoption of U.S. Refugee Act of 1980— affirming the act of welcoming the oppressed as a quintessentially American value. Since then, we’ve learned of the immense contributions that millions of U.S.-based refugees have made to the communities that welcomed them. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study showed that from 2005 to 2019, refugees delivered net gains of over $123 billion to the U.S. economy, in the form of jobs created, businesses launched, and taxes paid. This is one more reason why — in addition to saving lives and upholding U.S. and international law — it’s critically important that the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and access to asylum protections, legal immigration pathways that have been virtually eliminated, be restarted without delay.

The third and final strategic dimension I’d like to highlight is how U.S. respect for human rights and their universality upholds American well-being, especially when it comes to leading by example and protecting the integrity of our democracy for future generations. I know successive U.S. administrations – including President Biden’s– have fallen short in upholding human rights abroad, especially when it comes to applying human rights universally with U.S. partners, from Israel to El Salvador to Saudi Arabia. But our current trajectory not only deprioritizes human rights in our diplomacy but externalizes escalating domestic human rights abuses – from unlawful transfers of migrants to arbitrary detention in third countries to extrajudicial killings in Pacific and Caribbean boat strikes. This is why our active civil society, our free and independent media, and our separate and empowered judicial and legislative branches are indispensable to hold policymakers accountable to uphold the law and do the right thing. It’s also why we must robustly push back on efforts to restrict civil society or dissent, under the false mantle of fighting domestic terrorism.

So faced with this existential crossroads for democracy and human rights, let’s reject the path of least resistance, fear, or apathy. Instead let’s work together to rebuild bipartisan consensus for keeping authoritarians in check, for smart foreign assistance investments that help hold autocrats, U.S. partners, and kleptocrats to account and keep human rights defenders and independent journalism afloat. Together, we should welcome refugees and other immigrants who enrich our communities and national prosperity. And together, we must defend the freedoms and rights enshrined in our Constitution – and reflected in the Universal Human Rights Declaration adopted 77 years ago today – that are the ultimate source of our national strength.

Mubashir was outside on his lunch break in Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis when he was arrested on Tuesday.
“I declined, because how will a picture prove I’m a US citizen?” he said.
Mubashir said the officers drove him to the ICE detention facility at Fort Snelling, a 17-minute drive from where he was arrested.
The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been a staunch advocate for the Somali community in his city, said the actions of the ICE agents were unconstitutional.","An American man was dragged out of a restaurant, forcibly arrested, and detained for two hours by masked federal immigration officers, according to reports.

The 20-year-old man, who gave MPR News only his first name, Mubashir, moved to the U.S. from Somalia as a child and later became a naturalized citizen.

Mubashir was outside on his lunch break in Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis when he was arrested on Tuesday.

While walking out on the street near 4th Street and Cedar Avenue, Mubashir said he noticed two masked men approach him, to avoid them he went into a nearby restaurant.

The two men followed him inside, dragged him outside, and arrested him. Mubashir was also pushed onto his knees in the snow and put into a chokehold, CBS Newsreported.

Mubashir began yelling, “I have my ID,” to the officers; however, the agents did not respond.

When he was put into the car, Mubashir was asked if the agents could take his picture.

“I declined, because how will a picture prove I’m a US citizen?” he said.

“I told him, ‘I have my passport, it’s in my phone. Can I open it and show you?’ He declined. I told him ‘can I give you my name and my date of birth?’ He declined.”

Due to Mubashir’s refusal to have his picture taken, he was in the car for almost an hour. The agents also tried to take his fingerprints; however, their machine was not working.

Mubashir said the officers drove him to the ICE detention facility at Fort Snelling, a 17-minute drive from where he was arrested. He claimed the officers were lost and did not know their surroundings.

“They kept going back on the same highway. I told them, ‘are you guys lost?; they said, ‘this is our first time taking someone in’. They had their maps out and everything and they were trying to intimidate me,” he said.

Once they arrived, the officers kept him outside until he agreed to have his face scanned; however, like the first machine, the second machine was not working, so he was brought inside.

At the facility, a staff member allowed him to turn on his phone to show his ID, which prompted them to release Mubashir as his parents arrived to pick him up.

The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been a staunch advocate for the Somali community in his city, said the actions of the ICE agents were unconstitutional.

“What we saw by these ICE agents that clearly did not know what they were doing was violence and unwillingness to hear the simple truth, which he was repeating again and again, which is, ‘I’m an American citizen’,” he said.

“[He was] taken into custody for now reason at all, in clear violation of law and the Constitution of the United State for simply walking down the streeting and looking like he’s Somali.”

President Donald Trump has been stoking tensions against the Somali immigration population, describing the community as “garbage” and saying he does not want them in the country.

Federal agents have also launched a crackdown against Minnesota Somalis, sparking criticism from leaders of the Somali community and democrats, including Frey and Governor Tim Walz.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has also branded Trump as a national embarrassment on X after his rant against immigrants and Somalis.

“He needs serious help,” she wrote. “Since he has no economic policies to tout, he’s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead.

“He continues to be a national embarrassment.”

About 84,000 of the 260,000 Somalis in the country live in the Minneapolis-St. In the Paul area, the overwhelming majority of them are U.S. citizens. Almost 58 per cent were born in the U.S., and 87 per cent of those born elsewhere are naturalized citizens.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/04/3/43/SEI274643746.jpg?trim=0,2,0,1&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-12-11 19:57:08.217120

WASHINGTON – U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced today U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have made more than 10,000 arrests of illegal aliens—including murderers, kidnappers, sexual predators, and armed carjackers—in Los Angeles, California since June 2025.

This success of this operation is in spite of violent rioters who assaulted our law enforcement, threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at them, and attempted to obstruct lawful arrests of criminal illegal aliens.

In a move that some commentators compared to China and others warned would decimate tourism to the US, including the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the Department for Homeland Security said it was planning to apply the rules to visitors from 42 countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Germany and Japan, if they want to enter the US on the commonly used Esta visa waiver.

The checks will be carried out when a traveller applies for their Esta and “will require Esta applicants to provide their social media from the last five years” as well as “telephone numbers used in the last five years” and “email addresses used in the last 10 years”, government documents show.

“The seriousness of this move should not be downplayed,” said Jemimah Steinfeld, the chief executive of Index on Censorship in London. “Through a simple search any posts critical of Trump and his administration could be revealed and then what? Will admission to the USA be predicated on being nice about the president? That would be censorship pure and simple and the result will extend far beyond as people start to self-censor to keep the door to the USA open to them.”

Amnesty International UK called the plan “wildly out of proportion to any legitimate border need”.

“This moment shows how ‘slippery slopes’ on human rights suddenly become cliffs. Years of unchecked data-trawling at borders, including the UK’s, have led us here,” said Javier Ruiz Diaz, the group’s technology and human rights lead.

The Big Brother Watch campaign group called the plan “the latest evidence of the Trump administration’s enthusiasm for shredding civil liberties in the name of border control and national security”.

“The US government would each year have access to millions of years’ worth of social media content, the vast majority of which includes speech that is legal in the United States,” said Matthew Feeney, the group’s advocacy manager. “This would encourage millions of law-abiding people, including many American citizens, to self-censor criticism of the US government. So much for the Trump administration’s commitment to free speech.”

In Brussels, Trump’s move was described as “ironic” given his criticism of the EU’s €120m fine of Elon Musk’s X platform last week as “nasty”. The border measures were “a dramatic overreach and breach of fundamental rights,” said the German MEP Birgit Sippel, a member of the European Parliament’s committee on civil Liberties, justice and home affairs.

Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said the new entry requirements were “an outrageous demand that violates fundamental free speech and free expression rights”, according to Politico.

Trump said on Wednesday: “We want safety. We want security. We want to make sure we’re not letting the wrong people come into our country.”

Asked on Thursday how it would protect its employees from the checks, the European Commission described the policy as “floated plans”. “We haven’t seen any confirmation of this plan, so there’s no need for us to further speculate,” a spokesperson said.

The UK-based Free Speech Union, led by Toby Young, also declined to comment, saying it had a policy of not commenting on free speech issues in other countries.

The move sparked some darkly comic responses. The X account of the UK satirical news programme Have I Got News for You said: “The US border force is considering ‘social media checks’ for visitors before allowing them entry, which is fine because we’ve always said Trump’s ideas are great and he’s a good person.”

Seth Bannon, an investor from San Francisco, said: “This is insane. China is preparing to require tourists to hand over five years of social media history, all email addresses and phone numbers used in the last five years, and the freaking names and addresses of family members. No thanks won’t be visiting anytime soon!”

He followed up with a post saying: “Oh no whoops no that’s the US, not China.”

Jon Cooper, a former campaign chair for Barack Obama, said: “This is insane. It will DECIMATE the US tourism industry.” Paul Barry, an investigative journalist based in Australia, added: “Bang goes that US trip.”

Within the past five years, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, has posted on X that the Trump supporters who rioted at the Capitol in 2021 were part of “a direct attack on democracy and legislators carrying out the will of the American people”.

Going back further than the five years of social media posts that would be checked, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, called Trump in 2017 an “odious, sad, little man”. The same year, the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, who is holding meetings in Silicon Valley this week, accused Trump on X of “degrading [the] office of the president” over a tax bill that benefited the super-rich and said: “Trump & Putin don’t want ‘real’ news, they want silence”.

Jeremy Bradley, an expert in privacy and the managing director of Zama, a cryptography company based in Paris, said it was wrong to treat someone’s online history as a permanent record of their beliefs, because people’s views changed.

“Personal choice and freedom of expression shouldn’t be sacrificed in the name of surveillance, especially when it chills speech and curtails basic freedoms,” he said. “Privacy isn’t just a technical issue; it’s about dignity and the freedom to be human.”

X, TikTok and Meta, which operates Instagram, Facebook and Threads, were approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3b1f5a02d69656c25237a4b22fc2d8219e96bd/0_0_4000_3200/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff4f7fa881b87f7e243fdda4bbdc2838",N,,2025-12-11 16:00:04.848813

Many Afghan immigrants who came to the United States through the appropriate legal channels are growing increasingly worried about their status.

The crackdown started the week of Thanksgiving, when an Afghan immigrant — Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who had worked with the CIA in his home country — allegedly shot two West Virginia National Guard members in Washington, D.C., Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe. Beckstrom subsequently died from her injuries.

There are roughly a quarter of a million Afghans in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, including roughly 15,000 who have settled in the Houston area since 2021. It's unclear how many are still waiting for permanent status.

Houston immigration attorney Ali Zakaria said many of them are scared.

""The Afghan community feels very concerned that they are being painted as shooters or terrorists or disloyal to the United States without any evidence. One shooter out of 250,000 people does not make the entire community murderers,"" Zakaria said. ""We're getting calls. Afghan clients are asking what will happen to us, and at this stage, we just don’t have any answers, because we don’t know how far the government will go based on its announcements.""

“I said that, ‘That has nothing to do with him'”

At 8 a.m. on the morning of Dec. 2, at their home in Hicksville, New York, Milad Nyazi woke up his wife, Sophia, to tell her that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had arrived. Sophia Nyazi thought he was joking. But there were three ICE agents there to arrest Milad. When asked, they declined to produce a warrant, she said.

""And then they said that, ‘Ma’am, we have to take him into custody. We have to detain him regarding the shooting of last week with the Afghan parolee that shot the two National Guards,' ” Sophia Nyazi said. ""And then I said that, ‘That has nothing to do with him.'""

Sophia is a native-born U.S. citizen, the daughter of immigrants who came to the U.S. during the Taliban's first period in power. But she said Milad is an Afghan immigrant on humanitarian parole since 2021, in the process of applying for a green card, which offers permanent U.S. residency.

The ICE agents refused to look at Milad's documentation, according to Sophia, who said they refused to let her go with them. They even balked at letting her and Milad's 3-year-old daughter kiss Milad goodbye, though they finally allowed it, she said.

""She finally hugged him and kissed him,"" Sophia Nyazi said, ""and then my husband’s eyes were red. We were all emotional. And then they covered his head, and they arrested him, put his handcuffs in front, and they took him away.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not commented when asked about immigration policy changes by the Trump administration and the reasons behind them.

But in a statement to Houston Public Media specifically about Milad Nyazi’s case, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “On December 2, 2025, ICE New York arrested Milad Nyazi, a 28-year-old criminal illegal alien from Afghanistan,” adding that he has two previous arrests for alleged domestic violence.

Sophia Nyazi said the arrests were the result of a misunderstanding and that all charges were dropped. An exhaustive search of multiple databases turned up no other criminal records. And Milad has not been charged in relation to the Washington shooting, nor is there any evidence he had any involvement in that case.

“Things are really bad for these folks”

Shawn VanDiver is president of AfghanEvac, an organization dedicated to helping Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war to resettle in the United States. He said, since the shooting in Washington, the Trump administration has shuttered almost all legal options for Afghan nationals to come to the United States.

""The only people that can get here right now are people who already had a visa in their passport. So, if you have a visa in your passport, you should get here as fast as you can,"" VanDiver said. ""Things are really bad for these folks.""

U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, had previously advocated strengthening and expanding the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program aimed at helping Afghans who had assisted the U.S. during the long war in their country to come to the U.S. and become citizens. But Cornyn, who is facing tough primary challenges from both Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Houston-area U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, recently defended the Trump administration's crackdown.

""This is just one example of the abuse of something called parole, which is supposed to be done on a case-by-case basis,"" Cornyn said, ""but which [former President] Joe Biden claimed to have the authority to deal categorically with tens of thousands of immigrants from other countries around the world and bring them to the United States, basically unvetted.""

Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said the claim that Lakanwal was unvetted, which members of the Trump administration have stated repeatedly, is untrue. Lakanwal underwent multiple background checks, first when he went to work with the CIA, then before he came to the U.S., then when he applied for asylum, Gelatt said.

""I think the challenge with vetting is that the U.S. government can vet what’s in someone’s background — who they associated with, whether they were involved in a terrorist organization, whether they have a criminal history — but the vetting can’t predict who is likely to commit a crime in the future, at least not in any kind of reliable way,"" Gelatt said.

Annie Pforzheimer, who previously served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, supported Gelatt's argument and said it's a mistake to blame the screening process.

""This was something people took really seriously,"" Pforzheimer said. ""So, vetting itself can’t fix everything. What you really need are support services for people who are here. That is something that apparently was lacking in this case.""

“They’re going to kill him, and I don’t want that happening”

Pforzheimer said she was worried about what the Trump administration’s policy change would mean, not only for the Afghan community in the U.S., but for the future of U.S. diplomacy and security.

“I owe my life as a diplomat who served in Kabul on two separate tours, to Afghan allies,” Pforzheimer said. “When we were there — with the military, with our embassy — we repeatedly made promises of friendship and alliance and collaboration, and as a country, if our word is meaningless, if our honor is meaningless, I am concerned about how we’re going to go forward in a complex world of international relations where your word means something, or has to mean something.”

According to the ICE Detainee Locator website, Milad Nyazi has been moved to the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico, more than 2,000 miles from his family’s home. His wife, Sophia, said she feels no one is helping them. She's still seeking an attorney to take Milad's case pro bono.

""I’m scared,” said. “If he gets shipped to Afghanistan, once the Taliban gets him, God knows what happens, because once they find out, they’re going to kill him, and I don’t want that happening.""",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10165739/The-Nyazis-2.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 19:56:46.555515

(AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from an immigration detention center in Pennsylvania following an order from a federal judge issued Thursday, according to his attorney’s office.

Abrego Garcia’s attorney confirmed he was released just before 5 p.m. Thursday and told The Associated Press he plans to return to Maryland, where he has an American wife and child and where he has lived for years after originally immigrating to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. Attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said he’s not sure what comes next, but he’s prepared to defend his client against further deportation efforts.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland earlier Thursday ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.

The ruling marked a major victory for the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.

He had been held at Moshannon Valley Processing Center about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.

“The government still has plenty of tools in their toolbox, plenty of tricks up their sleeve,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said, adding he fully expects the government to again take steps to deport his client. “We’re going to be there to fight to make sure there is a fair trial.”

The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the judge’s decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.

“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.

Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the judge made it clear that the government can’t detain someone indefinitely without legal authority and that his client “has endured more than anyone should ever have to.”

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.

A court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.

In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials’ affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.

“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.

Xinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.

Separately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.

He is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.

A judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case.

House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.).
also asked Noem to commit to providing more DHS officials to testify before the committee, which the secretary agreed to do.
Democrats also confronted Noem with videos and specific cases that they claim demonstrate the excesses of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy toward unauthorized immigration.","In the face of criticism from Democrats about alleged misconduct on the part of U.S. immigration officers, Noem also defended the conduct of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, arguing that Democrats were unfairly villainizing immigration officials and contributing to violence against them and their families.

The hearing, an annual occasion which sees Homeland Security secretaries and FBI and NCTC directors testify before congressional committees about the threats the country faces, came at a particularly precarious moment for Noem. While Trump reiterated confidence in Noem on Wednesday, Trump allies have floated the names of several potential replacements as frustrations have boiled over in recent months with how DHS has spent money intended to boost the government’s deportation efforts and how DHS has managed federal disaster relief money.

Democrats took advantage of the rare appearance by Noem on Capitol Hill to re-up allegations that Noem gave a $220 million contract to a firm tied to the spouse of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin and argue that immigration enforcement officers have violated the civil rights and due process of unauthorized immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.

Ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and other Democrats called on Noem to resign, arguing that her tenure has been marked by incompetence, corruption and other malfeasance.

Democrats also noted it was only Noem’s second appearance before the House committee and one of the few times a DHS official had testified before the committee, as they slammed DHS for a lack of transparency with Congress. Thompson claimed that it had been very difficult to secure DHS officials as witnesses for hearings.

“Never in the history of the committee has a secretary of Homeland Security hidden from congressional oversight like you and your department have, Secretary Noem,” Thompson said at the start of the hearing.

House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.). also asked Noem to commit to providing more DHS officials to testify before the committee, which the secretary agreed to do.

Noem received most of the questions from Democrats and Republicans at the hearing, which also included fellow witnesses Michael Glasheen, the operations director of the FBI’s national security branch, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent. The two faced more questions once Noem left the hearing early to helm a FEMA-related meeting.

In a potential sign that Republicans see Noem’s position as relatively secure, GOP lawmakers went soft on Noem, voicing general satisfaction with the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement and homeland security broadly.

“The border is secure, the flow of drugs is slowing, and violent criminals are being taken off the streets. America is once again a symbol of global strength,” Garbarino said.

“Please go back to your agencies and thank the men and women that are serving every day and helping to keep this country safe,” said Rep. Tony Gonzalez (R-Texas), who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.

But Republicans did push Noem to help them conduct oversight of the department’s work. New York lawmakers from both parties asked Noem to explain why DHS decided to cut counterterrorism grants to the Empire State. Trump reversed that decision following advocacy from New York lawmakers.

Democrats also confronted Noem with videos and specific cases that they claim demonstrate the excesses of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy toward unauthorized immigration.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.) pointed to a case where a Korean-born U.S. Marine who served in the U.S. invasion of Panama was deported to Korea earlier this year over drug possession charges from the 1990s. His staffer had the Marine join the hearing via Zoom and held up the livestream with the Marine over Magaziner’s shoulder while the Rhode Island Democrat questioned Noem.

“These people are not the worst of the worst,” Magaziner said. “You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys. Go after the terrorists. Do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”

Noem pledged to review the individual cases brought up by Magaziner and Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.), but reiterated the Trump administration’s view that it cannot, and should not, make distinctions between the levels of criminal wrongdoing foreign nationals have committed.

“It is not my prerogative, my latitude, or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country and in which broad discretion of the secretary used to follow you can issue,” Noem said.

Democrats scoffed at that idea.

“You have broad discretion as the secretary,” Magaziner responded. “You can do all kinds of things. You’re choosing not to.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6b%2F4a%2F989950214e31a957ea1a2ed714f6%2Fu-s-congress-33702.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:59:55.736247

Abrego Garcia remains protected from being removed to El Salvador again, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had proposed deporting him to one of several African countries where he has no ties.

“Because Abrego Garcia has been held in ICE detention to effectuate third-country removal absent a lawful removal order, his requested relief is proper,” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in her 31-page opinion.

“Separately, Respondents’ conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer,” Xinis continued.

She ordered his release to take place “immediately” and demanded the government provide an update by 5 p.m. EST.

Though Xinis’s ruling paves the way for ICE to release Abrego Garcia, he remains subject to the pretrial release conditions imposed in his criminal human smuggling case.

Those include detention at his Maryland home with electronic monitoring, third-party custodianship and other measures to ensure he appears in court.

Still, Xinis’s ruling marks a major legal victory for Abrego Garcia, who has sought his release from immigration custody for months. Xinis is an appointee of former President Obama.

“This is naked judicial activism by an Obama appointed judge,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on the social platform X. “This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts.”

A Salvadoran national who entered the U.S. illegally nearly 15 years ago, Abrego Garcia garnered national attention after he was wrongfully deported in March to a megaprison in El Salvador despite an order protecting him from deportation to his native country over fears he would be the target of violence.

It became a flash point in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, a cornerstone of President Trump’s second-term agenda. The administration has accused Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, which he denies.

Abrego Garcia’s case quickly went to the Supreme Court and back, ultimately leading to his return to the United States in June as the Justice Department unsealed a human smuggling indictment against him in Tennessee. He pleaded not guilty.

After the judge in Tennessee permitted Abrego Garcia’s release pending trial, he returned to Maryland, where he had lived for more than a decade. He was quickly taken into immigration custody by ICE in August and has been detained ever since.

With the order protecting Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador still on the books, the Trump administration began proposing African countries to send him to.

At turns, officias provided him notice he would be removed to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana or Liberia, though they later said the Ghana notice was sent “prematurely.”

Abrego Garcia maintained he should be allowed to instead be removed to Costa Rica. The Trump administration insisted the country wasn’t agreeing to take him.

The judge found that to be untrue, writing in Thursday’s ruling that the Trump administration “affirmatively misled the tribunal” by suggesting otherwise.

“This evidently remained an inconvenient truth for Respondents,” Xinis wrote.

“But more to the point, Respondents’ persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” the judge continued.

Joining us to discuss the report's findings is Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA. Welcome to the program.

AMY FISCHER: Thank you for having me.

FADEL: So let's first talk about how you got to these findings. Did you have access to these detention facilities?

FISCHER: So ICE actually provided us access to the Krome facility, and while we were inside, we spoke to four individuals who were detained inside of Krome, who had also previously been detained at Alligator Alcatraz. And then, while we were in the area, we spoke with numerous lawyers and advocates and community members about the situation in Florida and inside both facilities.

FADEL: Specifically, what did you find at Krome, where you were actually able to see inside the facility, which is an actual ICE facility? Alligator Alcatraz is actually run by the state and not overseen by ICE.

FISCHER: Exactly. So at Krome, we heard from people inside that they are regularly denied medical care. They don't have adequate food. There is abuse by the guards. While we were actually inside, we were being allowed near the area where they have people in solitary confinement. And we were stopped by one of the individuals in solitary who said to us that he was on hunger strike. And when I bent down to speak to him through the food slot of his door, he was showing me his injured hand, how he had been denied medical care for well over 30 days. And in the midst of the conversation, an ICE agent actually slammed the metal flap on the injured hand of this individual and then repeatedly punched the door multiple times.

FADEL: And you requested access to Alligator Alcatraz. You did not receive a response. How did you get the findings you found about Alligator Alcatraz if you had no access?

FISCHER: We spoke with people that had been previously detained there. We also spoke with lawyers, with advocates and with family members who had loved ones detained inside. The descriptions of Alligator Alcatraz were truly harrowing. What we learned is that people there are detained in cages, over 30 people per cage, and only three toilets that oftentimes are broken and have sewage running into the sleeping areas. And most troubling, we heard about the use of something that is called the box, which was described to us as a 2-foot-by-2-foot cage-like structure in the open, and they are shackled at their hands and at their feet and chained to the ground in this cage in the sun for hours upon hours at a time, without access to food or water as a form of punishment.

FADEL: Did you take your findings to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE?

FISCHER: Yes. As part of all of Amnesty's reports, we send our findings to the respective agencies and provide them a right to reply. Neither the Department of Homeland Security, the government of Florida replied to those rights of reply.

FADEL: What recommendations are you making in your report about these two facilities?

FISCHER: Ultimately, these two facilities need to be shut down, and the people inside need to be released into their home communities. What we found at both facilities is that people are being detained arbitrarily. International law states that people should not be detained simply for immigration processing and should only be detained in the most extraordinary circumstances solely to provide identity or to mitigate flight risk.

FADEL: Amy Fischer is director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA, and one of the authors of this report on conditions in two Florida detention centers. Thank you so much for your time.

FISCHER: Thank you.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We reached out to the office of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis about this, and press secretary Molly Best sent us a statement. In it, she calls the Amnesty report a, quote, ""politically motivated attack"" and adds, quote, ""none of these fabrications are true."" The statement also alleged the report could jeopardize the safety and security of our staff. We've also asked for comment from the Department of Homeland Security. We haven't heard back.

Their contract is for up to 300 detainees. Jessica Plake, media director for the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance, or SMIA, said they average about 250 at any one time.

“And,” Plake said “the jail has about 1242 beds. So, people detained for Ice could make up about 25% of the Greene County Jail population.”

And Plake said, most of them have not been charged.

""Through our tracking,” she explained, “only 16 people out of the current 275 people currently detained as of today have a formal charge against them.”

The jail receives $100 a day from the federal government, per ICE inmate.

Plake and her group presented a petition to the Greene County Commission this month, asking the county and the Sheriff’s department to end the contract.

SMIA said detainment and detention policies have violated due process and human rights. Plake also said it's had economic impacts and affected communities where immigrants have put down deep and meaningful roots.

One of those communities is Troy, Missouri, where until earlier this year, Donna Hughes-Brown, lived with her husband, retired veteran Jim Brown. Hughes-Brown was born in England. She has lived in the US since she was 11 and has legal permanent resident status.

“Donna was detained,” Plake said, “after returning from a funeral in Ireland. And her life here in Missouri is one of deep roots, faith, family, caregiving and contribution.

Hughes-Brown was reportedly detained at O’Hare International Airport for two bad checks written in 2012 and 2015. Reporting indicates she received probation for the checks and paid back the sum, which was a combined $71. The black mark on her record was flagged as moral turpitude by ICE.

Hughes-Brown's case has made national headlines.

She will have a deportation hearing December 18. Ahead of that hearing, this Saturday, SMIA and partner organizations like Springfield Indivisible are organizing a vigil, in Springfield, Troy and Joplin. The event will recognize Hughes-Brown, but Plake said it is more than that too.

“The vigil is also going to serve to witness and acknowledge the pain of family separation, the disruption of lives, the inhumane conditions and honor impacted immigrants, their families and communities.” She said, adding, “we are also amplifying and also welcoming in to honor and recognize and witness the stories of those that we do not see amplified on a national scale.”

Plake said Hughes-Brown's case is representative of many in the immigration system, many who believe they are doing things the right way, and who have not known any other home country since they were children.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1015fe0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1727x907+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F54%2F8571568f4831aee704b03ffd61cd%2Fvigil-template-3.png,N,,2025-12-11 16:00:10.081513

When it was his turn to grill Noem during a House hearing on global security threats, Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) asked, “How many United States military veterans have you deported?”

Noem answered, “Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans.”

“I don’t believe you served in the military. I haven’t either,” Magaziner continued. “But I think you and I can agree as Americans we owe everything to those who have served our military in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?”

As Noem answered in the affirmative, an aide appeared beside Magaziner with an iPad screen revealing the face of 55-year-old Sae Joon Park.

Magaziner cut off Noem’s answer, saying, “Madam Secretary we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park, a United States army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.”

Magaziner explained that the Purple Heart recipient struggled with PTSD and substance abuse, and was arrested in the 1990s for “some minor drug offenses” before getting clean and sober.

“Earlier this year you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn’t lived in since he was seven years old,” Magaziner said. “Will you join me in thanking Mr. Park for his service for our country?”

Noem’s answer was conditional.

NOEM: Sir, I’m grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws —

MAGAZINER: And can you please tell Mr. Park why you deported him?

NOEM: — and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.

MAGAINER: But you understand many veterans struggle with PTSD, many veterans struggle with substance abuse challenges. This man took two bullets for our country. Will you — you have broad authority, by the way, as secretary, to issue humanitarian parole, to do deferred action — Will you commit to at least looking at Mr. Park’s case to see if you can help him find a pathway back to this country he sacrificed so much for?”

“I will absolutely look at his case, but —” Noem began as Magaziner interrupted to introduce two more veterans — present in the hearing room — whose relatives were deported.

Watch in our video player above.

Top military officials faced questioning over the deployments for the first time at the hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. They were pressed by Democrats over the legality of sending in troops, which in some places were done over the objections of mayors and governors, while Trump’s Republican allies offered a robust defense of the policy.

It was the highest level of scrutiny, outside a courtroom, of Trump’s use of the National Guard in U.S. cities since the deployments began and came a day after the president faced another legal setback over efforts to send troops to support federal law enforcement, protect federal facilities and combat crime.

“In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the committee chairman. The deployments, he said, are “not only appropriate, but essential.”

Democrats argued they are illegal and contrary to historic prohibitions about the use of military force on U.S. soil.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., had pushed for the hearing, saying domestic deployments traditionally have involved responding to major floods and tornadoes, not assisting immigration agents who are detaining people in aggressive raids.

“Trump is forcing our military men and women to make a horrible choice: uphold their loyalty to the Constitution and protect peaceful protesters, or execute questionable orders from the president,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard.

Military leaders point to training

During questioning, military leaders highlighted the duties that National Guard units have carried out. Troops are trained in community policing, they said, and are prohibited from using force unless in self-defense.

Since the deployments began, only one civilian — in California — has been detained by National Guard personnel, according to Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, commander of U.S. troops in North America. Guillot said the troops are trained to de-escalate tense interactions with people, but do not receive any specific training on mental health episodes.

“They can very quickly be trained to conduct any mission that we task of them,” Guillot said.

Republicans and Democrats see the deployments much differently

In one exchange, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted how former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations. She asked whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful.

Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the Defense Department, said he was unaware of Trump’s previous comments and that “orders to that effect would depend on the circumstances.”

“We have a president who doesn’t think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response.

Republicans countered that Trump was within his rights — and his duty — to send in the troops.

WATCH: National Guard is not Trump’s ‘private army,’ California AG Bonta

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana, a former Navy SEAL officer, argued during the hearing that transnational crimes present enough of a risk to national security to justify military action, including on U.S. soil.

Sheehy claimed there are foreign powers “actively attacking this country, using illegal immigration, using transnational crime, using drugs to do so.”

Senators also offered their sympathies after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington were shot just blocks from the White House in what the city’s mayor described as a targeted attack. Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died a day after the Nov. 26 shooting, and her funeral took place Tuesday. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe is hospitalized in Washington.

Hearing follows court setback for Trump

A federal judge in California on Wednesday ruled that the administration must stop deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control of the troops to the state.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer granted a preliminary injunction sought by California officials, but also put the decision on hold until Monday. The White House said it plans to appeal.

READ MORE: What is the Insurrection Act? Here’s what Trump has said about using it

Trump called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops in June without Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval to further the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.

The move was the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor and marked a significant escalation in the administration’s efforts to carry out its mass deportation policy. The troops were stationed outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles where protesters gathered and were later sent on the streets to protect immigration officers as they made arrests.

Trump also had announced National Guard members would be sent to Illinois, Oregon, Louisiana and Tennessee. Other judges have blocked or limited the deployment of troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, while Guard members have not yet been sent to New Orleans.

North Carolina sheriff keeps challenging top lawmaker who got Trump’s backing

President Trump has endorsed North Carolina’s longtime state Senate leader for reelection. But the announcement hasn’t been enough to get a sheriff challenging Phil Berger to abandon a March GOP primary for Berger’s Senate seat.

Trump praised both Berger and Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page on Truth Social late Wednesday but gave his backing to Berger, who’s the most powerful Republican in state government.

“Sam Page is GREAT, he has been a longtime supporter, but I really want him to come work for us in Washington, D.C., rather than further considering a run against Phil,” Trump wrote.

Page said on X that while he appreciates Trump’s kind words, he’ll keep running. Page says he’s “committed to upholding conservative values” and in part ending “liberal policies” Berger has pushed.

Berger’s hands have been on scores of right-leaning policies in state government since 2011. But he’s received some opposition, in part, for backing a potential casino. The bill permitting the casino fizzled.

Berger said he’s very grateful to have Trump’s support “as we pursue more conservative victories.”

White House won’t rule out future seizures of oil tankers

Asked if the seizure of a Venezuelan tanker was a one-off or if the U.S. might take similar actions in the future, Leavitt said she wouldn’t broadcast future military plans.

But she added, “We’re not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narcoterrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world.”

The White House has maintained that the tanker seized was carrying oil set to be sold in violation of international sanctions.

Leavitt added that the Trump administration is “executing on the president’s sanctions policies” and defending the sanctions policies of the U.S.

White House says tariffs means children’s dolls might cost ‘a dollar or two more’

Leavitt said the president was trying to defend his tariffs when he said at a rally Tuesday that Americans should buy fewer dolls and pencils for their children.

Trump was saying his tariffs are bringing back factory jobs and products made domestically might cost more, Leavitt said.

“Maybe you’ll pay a dollar or two more, but you will get better quality and you’ll be supporting your fellow Americans by buying American,” Leavitt said. “And that’s what the president was saying.”

The answer reflected some of the challenges that the administration faces on the import taxes imposed by Trump, which most economists say have added to inflationary pressures.

The White House has previously maintained that foreign countries would pay the taxes and that there would be little to no inflation domestically.

White House: Trump ‘extremely frustrated’ with lack of Ukraine peace progress

Leavitt said discussions continue and the U.S. could send a representative to those discussions as soon as this weekend “if there is a real chance of signing a peace agreement.”

But she added that it’s “still up in the air whether real peace can be achieved.”

Trump took office in January suggesting he could solve Russia’s war in Ukraine quickly but has spent months complaining bitterly about a lack of progress. Leavitt said the president is “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war.”

“And he’s sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting,” Leavitt said. “He doesn’t want any more talk. He wants action.”

Trump administration plans to ‘seize’ oil from tanker taken off Venezuelan coast

Leavitt says the U.S. government “does intend to seize the oil” from a tanker that U.S. forces took Wednesday off the coast of Venezuela.

Leavitt said the Justice Department had received a warrant to take the tanker because it’s a sanctioned vessel used to carry “black market” oil.

She said the U.S. has an investigative team on the tanker. The team is interviewing the people aboard the ship and collecting any relevant evidence.

Leavitt said the U.S. government will follow the legal process required to seize the available oil.

White House press secretary says Trump ‘prepared to take action on health care costs’

Karoline Leavitt was asked about the looming expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies after the Senate’s rejection of legislation that would have extended the tax credits.

The briefing came just after the chamber rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts.

Also blaming Democrats for the Obama-era health care bill, which she noted was passed “without a single Republican vote,” Leavitt argued that Democrats had “ballooned” the program “with these expensive COVID subsidies that completely distorted the health insurance market.”

Senate rejects legislation to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits

The rejection essentially guarantees that millions of Americans will see a steep rise in costs at the beginning of the year.

Senators rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts Thursday.

It’s an unceremonious end to a monthslong effort by Democrats to prevent the COVID-19-era subsidies from expiring on Jan. 1.

Ahead of the votes, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans that if they did not vote to extend the tax credits, “there won’t be another chance to act,” before premiums rise for many people.

Republicans have argued that Affordable Care Act plans are too expensive and need to be overhauled.

FEMA Review Council meeting abruptly canceled, AP source says

A presidentially appointed council’s long-awaited public meeting to announce recommended reforms to the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been canceled at the last minute, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the change publicly.

The FEMA Review Council was scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon. Noem, the council’s co-chair, abruptly left a congressional hearing early because she said she needed to go the meeting.

Trump created the FEMA Review Council by executive order in late January, the same day he proposed eliminating FEMA. He has repeatedly said he wants to push more responsibility for disaster recovery to states.

The White House, Department of Homeland Security and FEMA did not respond to questions about the meeting’s cancellation.

Democrats accuse Noem of lying

Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, accused Noem’s department of waging an “unaccountable, unlawful, unconstitutional” war against communities across the country.

Ramirez showed a number of videos of Noem talking and then repeatedly accused her of lying.

“Secretary Noem, you lie and you lie to the American people,” Ramirez said.

In one video, Noem said the agency focused on people in the country illegally, not American citizens while in another Noem said they were focusing on the “worst of the worst.”

Ramirez disputed those characterizations and said Noem lied with “impunity.”

Senate rejects GOP bill to create health savings accounts

The Senate has rejected a Republican bill to replace expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies with new health savings accounts. The legislation was a Republican alternative to Democratic legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

Senators are now voting on the Democratic bill and are expected to reject it — meaning that the subsidies are likely to expire.

Noem defends FEMA cuts to mitigation funding

Noem defended the cancellation of billions of dollars in mitigation grants administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying the grants had been “weaponized to fund the Green New Deal and for climate change.”

The Trump administration in April canceled $3.6 billion in grants under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, created under the first Trump administration to help communities harden infrastructure to mitigate damage from climate disasters.

Noem said FEMA is “deploying resources two times faster on average, than in history,” though a policy that she personally approve DHS expenditures of $100,000 or more has been widely criticized for slowing deployment of FEMA services and dollars.

Noem leaves hearing early to go to FEMA review council

Secretary Noem has left the hearing early.

Noem said she had to go to another meeting of a council that is offering suggestions on how to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

As she walked out, Julie Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who was slated to question the secretary next, joked: “I’m just going to take the position that she was scared of my questions.”

As Noem walked out of the room, protesters trailed her down the hallway yelling “Shame on you!”

Senate National Guard hearing concludes with Democrat pressing for commitments on troop deployments

But Trump administration officials declined to make commitments on what authorities the president may use in the future to send National Guard troops from one state to another.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, used the closing moments of the hearing to press the officials on whether National Guard troops will be deployed from other states beyond their current authority to protect federal facilities and officials, such as to conduct law enforcement activity.

Federal judges have blocked or limited troop deployments in Oregon, Illinois and California as the Trump administration has attempted to use troops to assist in its mass deportation goals.

Mark Ditlevson, a Trump administration official who oversees homeland defense, only said that any orders would be evaluated to make sure they are “100% legal.”

Putin and Maduro speak by phone amid US pressure

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed solidarity with Maduro and told him “direct communication channels” between the countries “remain permanently open,” a Venezuelan government statement said.

Talking a day after the U.S. military seized an oil tanker off the Venezuela’s coast, Putin told Maduro that “Russia will continue to support Venezuela in its struggle to assert its sovereignty, international law, and peace throughout Latin America, making its diplomatic capabilities available to strengthen cooperation in these essential areas,” the Venezuelan government said.

The Kremlin said both leaders also discussed developing friendly bilateral ties and their commitment to joint projects in trade, economic, energy, financial, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas.

Senate voting on first of two partisan health care bills

The Senate is voting on Republican legislation that would create new health savings accounts as health care subsidies for millions of Americans are set to expire Jan. 1.

The Senate is expected to reject the legislation, along with a second Democratic bill that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Republicans say the savings accounts would replace the subsidies by giving money directly to consumers, instead of to insurance companies. Democrats say the GOP plan would lead to higher costs for consumers.

Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that premiums will skyrocket unless Congress passes an extension of the subsidies. “If Republicans don’t climb aboard, there won’t be another chance to act,” Schumer said ahead of the votes.

Noem says Venezuela tanker seizure part of administration’s anti-drug campaign

Noem linked the seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast to the Trump administration’s efforts to push back on “a regime that is systematically ... flooding our country with deadly drugs.” She said Trump administration officials had seized “enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.”

On Wednesday, Trump said the United States had seized the tanker as tensions mount with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Trump has broadly justified a regional military buildup and a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean as necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.

Democrats question Noem about deportations

House Democratic identified members of the audience they said had family members who had been improperly treated by the immigration system.

Noem said she would review the cases of several called out by Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. One, a combat veteran, appeared on a screen via a video call. Magaziner said the Purple Heart recipient had been deported earlier this year.

“You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys,” Magaziner said to Noem.

Noem interrupts lawmaker during questions over National Guard shooting

The hearing quickly became heated over the tragic shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

Thompson had begun questioning Noem over what he called the “unfortunate accident” when the secretary interrupted the ranking Democrat.

“Unfortunate accident?” Noem retorted. She called it a “terrorist attack.”

The interaction devolved from there as Thompson questioned her department’s approval of asylum claim that allowed the suspect to stay in the U.S.

Noem insisted it was the Biden administration’s vetting process that failed to properly screen the man who had worked alongside the U.S. military in Afghanistan.

Pentagon attorney: legality of shooting protesters would ‘depend on the circumstances’’

An attorney for the Pentagon declined to offer a clear answer when asked if a president could lawfully order the military to shoot protesters.

During a hearing Thursday on National Guard deployments in U.S. cities, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations.

Hirono asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the defense department, whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful.

Young said he was unaware of Trump’s comments and responded that the answer “would depend on the circumstances.”

“We have a president who doesn’t think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response.

Judge orders Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be immediately released from immigration detention

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.”

The Salvadoran national has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Noem calls National Guard shooting suspect a ‘terrorist’

The secretary also levied broad criticism of the program that brought the man to the United States years before he allegedly shot two National Guard members.

Operation Allies Welcome was created by the Biden administration to save Afghan supporters from Taliban retribution after the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars of aid.

Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the Washington shooting. Noem said Thursday that U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, has been showing improvement.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He pleaded not guilty.

Senators question military leaders on evaluating the lawfulness of orders

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, questioned Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, on how he evaluates the lawfulness of orders.

Guillot said that he consults with military attorneys, raises any questions with the defense secretary and commanding military officers, and executes the order once he’s confident in its lawfulness.

This has become a pressing question under the Trump administration amid National Guard deployments to U.S. cities and a campaign to strike boats allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela. The president has targeted Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence officers to refuse illegal orders.

Protesters interrupt Noem’s remarks at House hearing

“End deportations!” shouts one. “Stop ICE raids!” yells another.

The two people were escorted by Capitol Police out of the Homeland Security Committee hearing room.

Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., gaveled the panel back to order as Noem resumed her opening remarks.

Top Democrat calls on Noem to resign

Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told the secretary she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump’s “extreme” immigration agenda, and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress.

“I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. “Do a real service to the country.”

Noem hearing before Homeland Security panel getting underway

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration’s hard-line approach to immigration.

Since Noem last appeared in Congress in May, immigration enforcement operations in U.S. cities have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department’s tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. Thursday’s appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

Democrat says most Americans don’t want Guard members in cities

Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said Trump’s deployment of the National Guard into American cities is “deeply unpopular.”

“Most Americans don’t want this,” she said at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, adding that most of the Guard members don’t want these assignments, either.

“Our heroes did not sign up for this,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard.

She noted that she had threatened to hold up the annual defense bill if Republican leadership continued to block the hearing, which she said is long overdue. She said she has questions for the military about how Trump’s deployments are affecting readiness, training and costs.

Senate hearing on National Guard deployment begins

The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is opening a hearing on Trump’s National Guard troop deployment to U.S. cities by asserting that crime is on the rise.

“In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.

He added that the troop deployments are “not only appropriate, but essential.”

Democrats are expected to use the hearing to criticize the deployments as an inappropriate use of military troops.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/9ecc83ad-dcd4-43a1-9180-311288814c6d/20251211T130505/9ecc83ad-dcd4-43a1-9180-311288814c6d.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:57:32.583147

We are in the best position in decades to achieve comprehensive immigration reform.","With the border secure, the time is ripe for comprehensive immigration reform for the first time in forty years. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops offers our legislators an outline of a balanced path forward, protecting our nation and its citizens while respecting the dignity of each human person.

Today’s immigration debates tend toward a simplistic binary: standing with immigrants—including the undocumented—or supporting law enforcement efforts to remove noncitizens with no legal status. The U.S. bishops take a more nuanced stance in their Special Message, affirming the duty of a nation to control immigration while recognizing the human cost of “indiscriminate mass deportation,” which ensnares noncitizens brought here as children, those married to U.S. citizens, and those who have developed significant ties to the country.

The bishops apply two bedrock principles of Catholic social teaching: solidarity and subsidiarity. Solidarity recognizes that each of us, created in the image and likeness of God, possesses inherent dignity. Even those illegally in the United States have a claim to dignity and respect. Indiscriminate mass deportation violates the principle of solidarity because it treats the undocumented as a monolithic whole without distinguishing individual claims for remaining within our political community. Subsidiarity recognizes that human beings flourish in community, including the political community.

Deeply influenced by natural law, legal scholars applied these principles as nation-states emerged centuries ago. Every human being, they said, has a right to emigrate—leave his or her country—if the conditions for human flourishing are absent in his or her homeland. And, every country has a qualified right to control its borders, including excluding potential immigrants. Countries, however, have a duty to accept some immigrants if they can be incorporated into the economic and social fabric of the nation without undue hardship on its citizens.

These principles apply Catholic teaching on the universal destination of goods. Gifted by the Creator, the goods of the world are for the benefit of all. The common good, however, is achieved in the particular. Parents, for example, contribute to the common good by feeding, forming, and educating their children. Justice requires, however, that they share their surplus in some fashion with the broader community.

The same applies to the nation-state. The United States contributes to the common good of the world by creating an environment where its citizens can flourish. Our excess, in justice not charity, should be shared with others in need through foreign aid or by providing immigration opportunities. What is needed for the nation to flourish and what is surplus is a matter of prudential judgment on which reasonable people can disagree.

Forty-four years ago, University of Notre Dame president Rev. Theodore Hesburgh chaired the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, which led to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Sympathizing with “the plight of illegal aliens,” Hesburgh also considered the cost to “Americans whose wages and standards are depressed by their presence”; the undocumented themselves who often risk life to enter illegally only to face exploitation by employers; and those noncitizens “waiting patiently in line” for years to enter the United States legally.

Democrats and Republicans alike sought to “close the back door on illegal immigration so that the front door on legal immigration may remain open.” Congress attempted to close the back door with sanctions for employers who hired undocumented labor. It also reformed legal immigration and provided a path to citizenship for most of the 4.5 million undocumented immigrants then residing within our borders.

The attempt to close the back door was a spectacular failure, and we are dealing with the fallout four decades later. By the early 2000s there were 12 million undocumented immigrants residing in the country. When President George W. Bush attempted in 2007 to push through comprehensive immigration reform, including another amnesty, House Republicans balked. Their mantra: Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. They lacked faith that future presidents would vigorously enforce our immigration laws. This stalemate has persisted for nearly twenty years.

In 2021, the floodgates opened with the president abusing his power to parole people into the United States, allowing millions in, knowing that only a small percentage had legitimate asylum claims. Pew Research estimated that a record 3.5 million unauthorized aliens entered between 2021 and 2023, with the number continuing to rise at record rates throughout the first half of 2024.

The pendulum swung strongly in 2025 with the new administration aggressively targeting criminal aliens, encouraging the undocumented to self-deport and sweeping up even those trying to quietly build lives in the United States, instilling fear throughout the undocumented population. This is an unfortunate but natural backlash to the failure to keep the promise made by both parties four decades ago to shut the back door of illegal immigration.

Yet herein lies hope. In 2007, House Republicans told the president to secure the border before considering some form of relief for the millions here in undocumented status. The border is now effectively secure.

For the common good, the Trump administration should continue to deport criminal aliens. It should also work with Congress to develop legislation that adopts a comprehensive, three-pronged reform plan to fix our broken immigration system.

First, the back door must remain shut. The bill should impose heavy penalties on employers who hire undocumented employees, with employees facing a potential lifetime ban from the United States for accepting such employment. The executive branch’s discretion to skirt Congressional intent by granting parole or Temporary Protected Status to millions must be reined in by this bill. The United Nations estimates that over 139 million people in the world are displaced or stateless. Civil war, famine, natural disasters, and terror give each of these people a right to emigrate. Our response to their plight shouldn’t be left to the president alone. Together, our political branches should make prudential judgments on how many of the world’s “masses yearning to breathe free” the United States can absorb.

Second, the United States should calibrate our guest worker program to the ebb and flow of the economy. While protecting the American workforce, the United States ought to have a healthy front door to meet the market demand for labor in the United States.

Third, with the border now secure, we can turn our attention to the millions of unauthorized immigrants residing among us. Some own businesses, employing citizens and noncitizens alike. Others are hardworking individuals simply seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Some were brought here as children by their parents. Others have married citizens. Many have developed strong community ties. Congress ought to provide a path to legalization of status for many of these immigrants.

We must keep the back door of illegal immigration closed. The common good of the United States depends on it. There will be no do-overs. If we grant legal status to some portion of those currently here illegally but fail to secure the border, we will never see another amnesty, and the current efforts at deportation will seem like child’s play when the next backlash inevitably comes.

We are in the best position in decades to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. We must seize the opportunity, creating a more secure and prosperous nation for future generations.

In recent days, EU countries have agreed on three controversial laws aiming at speeding up asylum procedures and increasing returns, while the European Commission has announced a new sanctions regime against people-smugglers.

These moves reflect the bolder stance the EU has taken on the issue in recent years, including by breaking taboos and aligning its policies with stances once taken only by far-right parties.

""Bankrupt smugglers’ business""

On Wednesday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that Europe is developing a stringent new sanctions regime in coordination with G7 partners.

“Our goal is simple. We want to bankrupt their businesses through all means available,” she said. “We want to be able to freeze the smugglers’ assets – to destroy their very financial base. But also to issue travel bans, so that we can restrict their movements.""

She made the announcement in her opening statement at the International Conference of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling in Brussels, which was attended by more than 80 delegations, including EU members and several non-EU states.

Von der Leyen's statement follows a commitment already stated during her State of the Union speech three months ago, when she outlined a new system of sanctions specifically targeted at smugglers and traffickers.

According to EU sources, the Commission will come up with concrete proposals on the sanctions regime, though the timing is not yet clear. Currently, it is consulting EU member states before putting forward any new measures.

“The Commission took forward the work on establishing a new sanctions regime against smugglers and traffickers to freeze their assets, restrict their freedom of movement and deprive them of their profits,"" reads the press release.

Also on Wednesday, more than 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration based on three main pillars: preventing migrant smuggling by strengthening national frameworks and exchanging information among states, developing alternatives to illegal migration, and stepping up financial investigations to trace, seize, and confiscate smuggling proceeds.

""If we want to stop smugglers, we need to work together at a global level"", EU Commissioner for Migration Magnus Brunner told Euronews.

A crackdown on irregular migrants' chances to stay in the EU

In parallel, the EU is pursuing a clear strategy to make it harder for irregular migrants to reach European territory and easier to be deported far away.

On Monday, the EU Council agreed on three major legislative changes that have to be negotiated with the European Parliament before final approval.

One of these is the return regulation, which, among other provisions, would allow EU member states to build “return hubs” in third non-EU countries where they could send asylum seekers they have rejected.

“Return hubs” could also be used as “transit hubs” to accommodate migrant people before they are actually returned to their countries of origin, something that Italy is already doing with two centres built in Albania. But they could also represent a ""final destination"" if the third country accepts non-nationals and respects human rights standards.

This would help EU states to speed up returns, but it could also put migrant people at risk, since they would be sent to countries with which they have no connection.

Even asylum seekers could end up in completely unrelated countries under another law approved on Monday.

“The incentive to pay a human smuggler [to reach Europe] will diminish, if you know that as soon as you arrive, you will be returned to a centre in a third country"", Rasmus Stoklund, Danish Minister for Immigration, who led the negotiations on the files, told Euronews.

Places of safety

A change in the concept of “safe third country” would expand the circumstances under which an asylum application can be rejected as inadmissible, enabling EU states to deport asylum seekers to third countries with which they have no link – provided that those countries have an agreement with an EU state and that respect human rights.

This framework would allow EU governments to implement schemes similar to the UK's scrapped Rwanda deportation policy, which was ruled unlawful by the British Supreme Court.

The third law agreed by member states would create a list of “safe countries of origin” for the purposes of asylum, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco, and Tunisia, plus all the current candidate countries for EU membership except for Ukraine.

Nationals of these countries would still have the right to apply for asylum in EU member states, but their applications would be assessed via fast-track procedures.

These new measures have drawn criticism from leftist groups in the European Parliament and civil society.

""In 2018, the European Commission itself said that ideas such as return hubs or setting up offshore deportation centres far from Europe would put people at risk of refoulement, torture or arbitrary detention,"" Olivia Sundberg Diez, EU Advocate on Migration and Asylum for Amnesty International, told Euronews.

Newsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email outside office hours.

Why It Matters

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced the start of ""Operation Metro Surge,"" a federal immigration enforcement initiative in the Twin Cities that has involved increased activity by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul.

The operation has included arrests of individuals suspected of living in the country unlawfully, with federal officials saying the effort is focused on people with outstanding removal orders and criminal convictions.

The enforcement action coincided with recent remarks by President Donald Trump criticizing Somali immigrants in Minnesota. The president said he did not want Somali immigrants in the United States, sparking backlash from locals.

What To Know

City leaders, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O’Hara, said they were seeking additional information about the circumstances of the detention. They described the incident as concerning and emphasized that Minneapolis police were not involved in the federal operation.

Mubashir continued that he had asked agents if he could be dropped off back where he was picked up, to which they reportedly responded 'no, you have to walk in the snow'.

The administration has ordered a review of green card holders from Somalia and several other countries to determine whether they remain eligible to live in the United States.

The president has also ended the Temporary Protected Status for Somali nationals in Minnesota, a designation that had allowed a limited number of people from Somalia to live and work in the country because conditions there were considered unsafe for return.

Minnesota Governor Walz, in a letter to delivered on Wednesday to the DHS, revealed his concerns about the ongoing federal immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, citing reports that ""indicate that some citizens were documenting federal activity, while others were going about their daily lives"". Walz appeared to be referring to Susan Tincher, a 'citizen observer' during ICE arrests who was taken into custody.

Federal agents deployed pepper spray to disperse a crowd that was blocking their vehicles while they were conducting identification checks in a predominantly Somali neighborhood of Minneapolis on Tuesday.

What People Are Saying

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference: ""Taken into custody for no reason at all, in clear violation of law and the Constitution of the United States for simply walking down the street and looking like he's Somali.""

President Donald Trump said at a cabinet meeting on December 2: ""You know, our country's at a tipping point. We could go bad. We're at a tipping point. I don't know if people mind me saying that, but I'm saying it. We could go one way or the other, and we're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.""

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter told Newsweek: ""The Trump Administration’s threat to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents is a racially and politically motivated attack on our immigrant neighbors.

""By specifically targeting Somali families in Minnesota—home to the nation’s largest Somali community—the administration endangers lives and destabilizes entire neighborhoods.

""This action continues a pattern of harm we have come to expect from policies driven by division and discrimination. We stand with our Somali and East African neighbors in St. Paul and reject this retaliatory, fear-driven approach to governing.""

What Happens Next

Enforcement operations in the Twin Cities are expected to continue, with ICE officials stating that the focus remains on individuals with outstanding removal orders and criminal convictions.

The ruling by the judge, Paula Xinis, was a stinging defeat for the administration in a long and byzantine saga that over the past year has transformed Mr. Abrego Garcia from an unknown Salvadoran migrant living in Maryland into one of the best-known symbols of President Trump’s aggressive deportation agenda.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States in June but was arrested again on federal charges of human smuggling in Tennessee.

Even if he is released, Abrego Garcia still faces the criminal charges in Tennessee.","A federal judge has ordered that a Salvadoran migrant in the custody of federal immigration officials should be set free, saying the Trump administration had no legal basis to expel him from the country and had misled her at a hearing last month.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the immediate release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was detained earlier this year and mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States in June but was arrested again on federal charges of human smuggling in Tennessee.

Xinis’ order, filed on Thursday, Dec. 11, is the latest twist in a case that has been shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. It is unlikely to be the last word on the matter, however. The Justice Department will likely appeal the ruling.

Abrego Garcia, who was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2012, had been living with his wife and three children in Beltsville, Maryland, when he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents near his home in March.

He was among hundreds of alleged members of crime gangs MS-13 and Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, whom the government expelled to El Salvador on March 15. Abrego Garcia was deported even though an earlier order had prevented him from being returned to his home country.

The Justice Department blamed his deportation on an administrative error but insisted he was a member of the MS-13 gang, which he has denied.

In her order, Xinis said it is “troubling” that the Justice Department continued to hold Abrego Garcia in custody for months on the grounds that it was going to expel him to another country – without taking any steps to actually remove him from the United States.

Xinis said the government had no authority to send him to a third country without a legal removal order, which she said it did not have.

At a hearing last month, Xinis wrote, Justice Department lawyers informed the court that they had no alterative but to send Abrego Garcia to the African country of Liberia because Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to hold him there.

But Costa Rica never rescinded its offer, Xinis writing, citing news reports.

“This evidently remained an inconvenient truth” for the administration, she wrote, saying the government’s lawyers had “affirmatively misled” the court.

More to the point, she said, the government’s refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option and its “misrepresentation” that Libera was the only country that would take him “all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal.”

Because of the absence of a legal removal order and because the government’s conduct over the past few months raises questions about its reasons for holding him, Abrego Garcia should be held no longer, Xinis said.

Even if he is released, Abrego Garcia still faces the criminal charges in Tennessee.

A federal grand jury in Nashville indicted him on May 21 on human smuggling charges. The indictment alleges that, from 2016 through 2025, he and other unnamed people conspired to bring undocumented migrants into the United States from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador and elsewhere.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Why it matters: Abrego Garcia's case has rallied immigrant rights groups and became an emblem of President Trump's far-reaching immigration crackdown.

What they're saying: ""Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,"" U.S. Judge Paula Xinis wrote in her 31-page ruling.

""For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia's Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.""

Abrego Garcia's attorney declined to comment for this story.

The other side: ""This is naked judicial activism by an Obama appointed judge,"" DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin told Axios in an emailed statement.

""This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed DHS' intentions of appealing Xinis' ruling on Thursday, adding that America has ""unfortunately"" seen ""activist judges"" in ""many cases across the country.""

She also repeated the administration's position that Abrego Garcia is a gang member, which his attorney denies.

Context: An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be sent back to his home country of El Salvador for fear of persecution, but did not explicitly order him to be removed to a specific country.

Without a specific named destination for Abrego Garcia, the court ruled that he's being detained without a lawful final order of removal.

Zoom in: The Thursday ruling also found that the Trump administration was not making a consistent effort to remove Abrego Garcia in a timely manner.

Abrego Garcia has said his preferred destination is Costa Rica, but the Trump administration instead pushed to send him to African countries where the Salvadorian has no ties, including Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana.

Those governments declined to accept him, prolonging his stay in ICE custody despite the Costa Rican government's willingness to receive him.

The bottom line: Xinis wrote that between the administration's ""threats"" to send Abrego Garcia to African countries and its ""persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option,"" it is clear that ""whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the 'basic purpose' of timely third-country removal.""

""The power of Christ compels you,"" the man shrieked as he was escorted out by Capitol Police.

Another protester yelled at Noem to ""stop terrorizing our communities."" He was also led out of the hearing room by police.

President Trump boasted Thursday that the US stock market just hit a record high on his watch, even as recent surveys show Americans are concerned about the direction of the economy.

""STOCK MARKET JUST HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH!!! When will the Fake Polls show that I am doing a great job on the Economy, and much more??? Thank you!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed Thursday that he had ""constructive"" talks on security guarantees for Kyiv to help wind down its more than three-year war with Russia.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and US presidential envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner joined the discussion.

Zelensky said the document on the guarantees would be released ""in the near future.""

""Security guarantees are among the most critical elements for all subsequent steps. We have already got the negative experience of the Budapest Memorandum,"" he added.

""Everyone remembers this, as well as the occasions when Russia repeatedly violated all its other commitments. That is why it is essential that this document on security guarantees provides concrete answers to what concerns Ukrainians the most: what actions partners will take if Russia decides to launch its aggression again.""

Protesters on Capitol Hill forced a congressional hearing featuring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to pause again Thursday afternoon.

Anti-ICE rabble-rousers were yelling and screaming outside the congressional hearing, briefly pausing the action as security officials closed the doors.

""How dare you!"" and ""Shame on you!"" were heard among the yells as Noem exited the hearing.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shared new details about the oil tanker that was seized off the coast of Venezuela Wednesday.

""The operation that was conducted yesterday morning was a Coast Guard-led operation. It was in partnership with the Department of War and the Department of Justice. The FBI as well,"" Noem divulged in a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday.

""And it was a successful operation directed by the president to ensure that we're pushing back on a regime that is systematically covering and flooding our country with deadly drugs and killing our next generation of Americans,"" she went on.

The DHS boss said that since President Trump entered office in January, there have ""been enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.""

""That's two-thirds of our country that has been saved by blowing up, by going after and bringing to justice these individuals that are out at sea and those individuals that are funding it with a shadow fleet of sanctioned oil that should never be sold to benefit their profits and their pockets to kill Americans,"" Noem said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem agreed to review a handful of cases involving US military veterans or their family members who were deported after having committed non-violent crimes, sometimes more than a decade ago.

""Madam Secretary, you promised America that you would go after the worst of the worst. But these people are not the worst of the worst: a Purple Heart recipient, a military spouse, the father of three Marines,"" said Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI).

The Purple Heart recipient was arrested for ""minor drug offenses in the 1990s,"" Magazine had noted earlier, while the military spouse ""did not come here illegally and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80.10 years ago.""

Noem agreed to look at the case of Sae Joon Park, the US combat vet who was deported to South Korea, but told Magaziner it wasn't her job ""to pick and choose which laws"" to enforce.

Magaziner fired back: ""The biggest problem is this: You don't seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists. Do not go after veterans, Marines, children.""

As many as 18,000 terrorists entered the US during the Biden administration, according to National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent.

""There's 18,000 known and suspected terrorists in the country right now that came in under Joe Biden's watch,"" Kent told Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday.

""It's unbelievable,"" Pfluger responded.

""And that's just what we know of,"" added Kent.

Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California used his five minutes during the Homeland Security panel's hearing to list instances in which non-citizens without criminal records have been apprehended by ICE agents — without taking any questions from Noem.

At one point, Correa played a video of an interview Democratic reps held with some family members of those swept up in the immigration enforcement operations.

""Why did you vote for him [Trump]?"" a Dem rep asked Jim Brown, the husband of Donna Hughes Brown.

""Because I was an idiot. Eighty percent of the evangelical Christian people were lied to,"" responded Brown on the video that was played in the hearing.

""They said criminal, you know, and I believe criminals need to be off the street,"" he added. ""My wife and I, when we don't work, we're ministers. We help the needy. That's what we do. ... And that's who they're arresting.""

Correa is incorrect that Hughes Brown had no criminal record. She had written bad checks for $49 and $22 and been convicted for the crimes roughly a decade ago, according to the BBC.

Ranking Member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) disagreed with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent that the Biden administration's lax vetting enabled the DC National Guard shooting before Thanksgiving.

Both Noem and Kent disagreed, with the Homeland secretary balking at Thompson's choice of words that the shooting — which killed one National Guardswoman and injured another — was merely an ""unfortunate situation.""

""It was a terrorist attack,"" Noem informed Thompson.

""The individual was vetted to serve as a soldier in Afghanistan, and that vetting standard was used by the Biden administration as a ruse to bring him here,"" added Kent.

""Had we followed the standard operating procedures for special immigrant visas from that individual, and none of the allies welcome, people would have come to America. That's on Joe Biden.""

FBI National Security Operations Director Michael Glasheen told lawmakers in the hearing that probing Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization is currently a ""primary"" focus for the bureau — prompting the top Democrat on the House panel to question how much he's learned about it.

""What I see from my position is that's the most immediate violent threat that we're seeing on the domestic side,"" Glasheen said.

""Where is Antifa headquartered?"" asked Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).

""We are building out the infrastructure right now,"" responded Glasheen.

""So what does that mean?"" Thompson asked, growing testy. ""I'm just we're trying to get — if you say Antifa is a terrorist organization. Tell us as a committee, how did you come to that? ... How many members do they have in the United States? As of right now?""

""Well, that's very fluid. It's, it's ongoing for us to understand that,"" added Glasheen, saying the group was considered ""no different than al Qaeda and ISIS.""

The FBI official said the active investigation precluded him from sharing any further details.

Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, referred to the ambush attack against two National Guard members in DC, killing one, as an ""unfortunate accident.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quickly stepped to correct the Democrat about the Thanksgiving Eve attack in downtown DC.

""Unfortunate accident? It was a terrorist attack. They shot our Guardsmen in the head,"" she said.

Thompson (D-Miss.) called on Noem to resign in his opening remarks of the hearing.

""Do a real service to the country and just resign,"" Thompson says, ""that is, if President Trump doesn't fire you first.""

The Mississippi Democrat accused Noem of ""putting her own interests above the law"" in enforcing immigration crackdowns and making America ""less safe.""",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/noem-comp1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-11 12:57:35.326246

Per a September executive order, individuals are required to pay $1m, while businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m.
The gold card program has already faced heavy criticism by seemingly contradicting the US’s traditional reputation as a refuge for the hardworking poor.
Trump signed an executive order in September announcing the official launch of the gold card.
For example, New Zealand’s new golden visa program costs nearly $3m (US dollars), but managed to attract strong interest from wealthy Americans following Trump’s re-election.","Donald Trump launched a new program that will allow wealthy foreign individuals to buy a US “golden visa” for $1m, and trailed a “platinum” version for $5m.

“A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,” Trump wrote on Wednesday on social media.

An official government webpage promises US residency “in record time” with the new “Trump Gold Card” – once applicants have paid a $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), passed a background check and paid up $1m.

Per a September executive order, individuals are required to pay $1m, while businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m. Firms then need to pay a 1% annual maintenance fee of $20,000, and a 5% transfer fee of $100,000 each time they want to switch the visa from one employee to another.

The program comes as the Trump administration devotes significant resources to deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. The gold card program has already faced heavy criticism by seemingly contradicting the US’s traditional reputation as a refuge for the hardworking poor.

A “Trump Platinum Card” is also “coming soon”, according to the official website. This card will allow holders to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. It will cost $5m.

According to Trump, proceeds from the new program will go to “an account where we can do things positive for the country” and that it will generate “many billions of dollars”.

Trump signed an executive order in September announcing the official launch of the gold card. When the program was first reported in February, the price for a visa was $5m. The discounted price tag may give the card a competitive edge compared with similar “pay to jump the line” programs in other countries. For example, New Zealand’s new golden visa program costs nearly $3m (US dollars), but managed to attract strong interest from wealthy Americans following Trump’s re-election.

“Essentially, we’re having people come in, people that, in many cases, I guess, are very successful or whatever,” the president said back in September. “They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in. They’re going to pay, as opposed to walking over the borders.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc84c3a87a83c23b7a7a20086392c377d704082/751_0_4555_3643/master/4555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea3f5b432eff569aa8e93692e3d91c33",N,,2025-12-11 12:58:12.562915

A few days after EU countries agreed to the new rules on repatriation and safe countries, Italy and Denmark are advancing in the process of revision of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) triggered in May: on board now are 27 Council of Europe member states, which have approved a joint statement on the need for the ECHR to “effectively address migration challenges.”

“We need to launch a reflection on the capacity of international conventions to deal with the challenge of irregular flows,” Meloni insisted only yesterday, speaking remotely at the conference of the Global Alliance against the Smuggling of Migrants, a meeting of some 80 countries convened by Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa in Brussels to testify to the European grip on immigration. Meloni found in her Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, the perfect ally: in the still ongoing semester in which Copenhagen held the presidency of the EU Council, the acceleration was clear.

On 23 May, Italy and Denmark initiated the dispute over the ECHR with an open letter, also signed by Austria, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. A few months later, they were joined by Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. A total of 27 of the 46 member countries of the Council of Europe, the international body that drafted the Convention in 1950.

“Our governments have a duty to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of our peoples, including the right to live in peace, freedom and security, to preserve the values of our societies and to effectively protect our borders, prevent illegal border crossings and counter migrant smuggling networks,” the joint statement begins. Putting the freedoms of Europeans to a “severe test,” according to Meloni, Frederiksen and the others are the “people who take advantage of our hospitality by committing serious crimes, human trafficking and instrumentalisation of migrants.”

Challenges that “were unforeseeable” 75 years ago, and which now make a thorough readjustment of the Convention “imperative,” so that the iron fist launched with the new laws does not risk being stopped by the European Court of Human Rights. The ECHR must step aside and allow governments “to deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes,” even if their family resides in the host country, the 27 signatories demand. It must also “bring clarity” on inhuman and degrading treatment, which is “an absolute right” but “should be constrained to the most serious issues so as not to prevent States Parties from taking proportionate decisions on deportation of foreign criminals or in cases of removal or extradition.” And it should not pry into “innovative solutions,” and a

For Frederiksen, it is nothing more than “an adjustment of the balance between the important public interests of defending freedom and security in our societies and the individual rights of foreign criminals.” For Meloni, it is about ensuring that the security of citizens “is not subordinated to interpretations of the law that could end up rewarding individuals who have committed serious violations.”

Faced with the stance of the majority of member states, the Council of Europe adopted yesterday a set of conclusions on the need to draft a political declaration on migration issues and the European Convention on Human Rights. The opening is clear: “The instrumentalisation of migration, smuggling of migrants, trafficking in human beings and other criminal activities that threaten stability and security are real challenges, and it is legitimate to address them,” said Secretary General Alain Berset.

It will be the turn of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers—composed of the foreign ministers of the 46 member states —to draft a draft political declaration taking into account the “fundamental responsibility of governments to protect essential national interests, such as security and public safety.” The aim is to adopt such a declaration at the next ministerial meeting on 15 May 2026 in Chișinău, Moldova.",https://www.eunews.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251002__20251002-135233-L-2__v1__HighRes__DenmarkEuSummit-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 16:00:17.690335

A federal judge in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday ordered the release of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia from federal immigration custody in Pennsylvania — a long-awaited update in an extraordinary case that has dominated international headlines and federal court dockets for nearly 10 months.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia released from the ICE Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa., on the grounds that the Trump administration had not obtained the final notice of removal order that is needed to deport him to a third country, including a list of African nations they had previously identified for his removal.

""Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,"" Xinis said in her order on Thursday.

""For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.""

US JUDGE VOWS TO RULE 'SOON' ON ABREGO GARCIA'S FATE AFTER MARATHON HEARING

Xinis in November had used a lengthy evidentiary hearing to press lawyers for the Trump administration on whether it had the final order needed to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. to a third country, including the African nations identified by government officials.

Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign suggested then that the immigration judge who ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be removed back to his home country of El Salvador had ""meant,"" or implied a final order of removal — a notion Xinis dismissed in her ruling.

""No such order of removal exists for Abrego Garcia,"" she said.

The Justice Department is almost certain to appeal her order to a higher court, as Ensign indicated they would do in previous hearings.

Xinis had said last month that without final notice of removal, Abrego Garcia would be ""at a minimum"" entitled to certain relief. She cited Supreme Court precedent under Zadvydas v. Davis, which bars the government from indefinitely detaining migrants after removal issues have been ordered.

FEDERAL JUDGE EXTENDS ARGUMENTS IN ABREGO GARCIA CASE, SLAMS ICE WITNESS WHO 'KNEW NOTHING'

Abrego Garcia's status since March has been at the center of a legal and political maelstrom, when he was deported to his home country of El Salvador, in violation of a 2019 court order and in what Trump officials acknowledge was an ""administrative error."" Xinis ordered then that Abrego Garcia be ""immediately"" returned to the U.S.

Critics argue the months-long legal fight that ensued has allowed the Trump administration to test its mettle on immigration enforcement, as well as its ability to slow-walk or evade compliance with federal courts.

Senior DHS and Justice Department officials, for their part, have disputed that accusation.

They have also been sharply critical of Xinis and other federal judges presiding over deportation cages, whom they have repeatedly accused of overstepping their authority as a district judge.

""This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday in response to the order.

Upon his return to the U.S. in June, Abrego Garcia was immediately taken into federal custody in Nashville and detained on human smuggling charges, stemming from a 2022 traffic stop.

Government officials later acknowledged that the investigation into the traffic stop began when Abrego Garcia was still detained in El Salvador, prompting new questions as to the process of securing the indictment.

A federal judge in Tennessee has been hearing from the government and Abrego Garcia's lawyers on his motion to dismiss that case on the grounds of vindictive and selective prosecution.

A hearing on the motion to dismiss has been scheduled in Nashville for early next month.

ABREGO GARCIA REMAINS IN US FOR NOW AS JUDGE TAKES CASE UNDER ADVISEMENT

Xinis had also pressed Trump officials on why they could not deport Abrego Garcia to the third county of Costa Rica, whose government had granted the necessary assurances that they would not detain him or refoul him back to his home country of El Salvador.

Trump officials previously told her in court that Costa Rica was ""off the table,"" though they did not provide evidence.

Subsequent court filings appear to show that Costa Rica had not reneged on its agreement to accept Abrego Garcia into their country, casting renewed doubt on that claim.

The order from Xinis comes after lawyers for the Trump administration repeatedly asked Xinis to dissolve an emergency order she handed down in August, which required Abrego Garcia to remain in U.S. immigration custody, and within 200 miles of her court.

ABREGO GARCIA LAWYERS ASK US JUDGE TO ORDER RETURN TO MARYLAND AMID ONGOING CRIMINAL CASE

Xinis's order also ostensibly allows Abrego Garcia to remain in the U.S. with his brother, pending trial in the criminal case in Nashville.

The Trump administration previously tried and failed to remove Abrego Garcia to the African countries of Liberia, Eswatini, Uganda and briefly, Ghana.

Xinis noted in late November that the government cannot take any of those steps without the final notice of removal order.

At the time, an immigration judge concluded that he was likely to be targeted for violence by a gang in his home country.

After Abrego sued over his illegal deportation, Xinis quickly ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego’s return, a decision largely upheld by the Supreme Court. Administration officials, who publicly resisted Xinis’ command, ultimately returned Abrego in June after securing a grand jury indictment against him for human smuggling. Abrego is fighting those charges in Tennessee, where another federal judge has found a persuasive case that the indictment was brought with a vindictive motive.

Abrego’s case has become a symbol of the administration’s haphazard mass deportation rush, which has met stiff resistance in federal courts that have repeatedly described abuses, violations of due process, abhorrent conditions in immigration facilities and erroneous deportations.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the administration will “continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” calling Xinis’ order “judicial activism by an Obama appointed judge.”

Administration officials have accused Abrego, who illegally entered the United States around 2011 as a 16-year-old, of belonging to the violent gang MS-13, a contention Abrego has denied. Judges have repeatedly questioned the slim evidence prosecutors have presented of those allegations, despite repeated claims by President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior administration officials.

Abrego has signaled that he would be willing to accept deportation to Costa Rica, a country that has indicated it would welcome him there as a refugee. But the administration has floated plans to send him to several African nations, including Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia. Xinis cited these efforts as examples of the administration’s apparent drive to punish Abrego rather than secure his deportation.

Xinis also said it appeared the administration had misrepresented whether Costa Rica remained an option for Abrego’s deportation, saying in court that it was no longer on the table, only to be contradicted by a senior Costa Rican government official.

The administration’s “persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” Xinis wrote.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbc%2F57%2Fa0923d8a4dbba205572f8a2f361b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2231999229,N,,2025-12-11 12:58:16.985334

WASHINGTON — Today, instead of addressing the massive premium increases about to hit families nationwide due to expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, the Senate majority is pushing for new federal restrictions on abortion coverage in private insurance plans, to decimate access to gender affirming care, and to erect additional hurdles to health care for immigrants.

The bill has been offered as an alternative to renewing tax credits to make health insurance affordable for more than 22 million people. In addition to not adequately addressing the looming health care affordability crisis, it would prohibit millions of people who get health insurance through the ACA from paying for private plans that include abortion coverage, which will dissuade private insurance coverage of abortion and push abortion care out of reach for people across the country, including in states where it is legal.

The bill would also prohibit people on exchange plans, Medicaid, and CHIP from accessing gender-affirming medical care and add complicated hurdles for immigrants to access Medicaid coverage, including penalizing states that use their own money to cover health care costs for those who are excluded from Medicaid. Under these provisions, millions of eligible people could have essential care denied or delayed, including those who are part of mixed status families or citizens who simply fear being exposed to overzealous immigration enforcement.

In response to the Senate’s upcoming vote on S.3386, American Civil Liberties Union National Director of Policy & Government Affairs Mike Zamore released the following statement:

“Today, instead of acting to prevent massive health premiums hikes in three weeks, the Senate majority is working to make the health crisis even worse for families across the country by stripping the coverage of life-saving care in order to pursue their ideological agenda. Instead of lowering costs, the bill would prevent people from accessing abortion through ACA health care coverage, block access to medically necessary gender affirming care, and punish states for trying to extend coverage to their uninsured residents.

“A serious solution is still needed to address expiring ACA tax credits without sacrificing people’s access to essential health care services. The Trump administration and the congressional majority must stop playing political games with the health care of the American people before millions see their premiums skyrocket and their quality of care drastically decline.”

The report estimates ICE arrests rose more than threefold between December 2024 and June of this year — from just over 8,300 to more than 29,000.
“ICE arrests are having chilling effects on groups that are not eligible for deportation,” Herbst said.
Trump’s policy decision to rescind “sensitive location” status for places like day cares has translated into more immigration enforcement arrests near centers.
Herbst said he expects disruptions not just to the child care sector but to other industries that are immigrant intensive.","A jump in immigration enforcement arrests under the Trump administration is having a detrimental impact on America’s child care system, reducing the number of immigrant workers available and prompting mothers with young children to leave their jobs as they scramble for stable care.

That’s according to a report released Wednesday by the Better Life Lab at the nonprofit New America, which examined how increased arrests during the first half of the year by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has had a ripple effect on a women-led child care workforce where about 1 in 5 workers are immigrants.

The report estimates there are roughly 39,000 fewer foreign-born child care workers since Trump took office in January. There are also 77,000 fewer American mothers of preschool-aged children in the workforce since that time, a result that researchers found is tied to the impact of ICE arrests. Mothers have already been exiting the workforce in droves.

“It’s not surprising that we find that disruptions to the child care market vis-à-vis an increase in immigration enforcement has led to a decline in the number of foreign-born workers, and because of the disruptions in the child care market, this has led to spillovers in the labor market for mothers with kids more generally,” said Chris M. Herbst, one of the authors of the report and a professor of public policy at Arizona State University whose research includes the economics of child care. “These kinds of immigration-induced disruptions have had negative labor market implications.”

The group analyzed federal labor statistics and newly compiled ICE arrest data between September 2023 and July 2025 and found that immigrant labor — both among foreign-born and U.S.-born child care workers — decreased as arrests spiked this year and workers tried to avoid being targeted by ICE agents. The report estimates ICE arrests rose more than threefold between December 2024 and June of this year — from just over 8,300 to more than 29,000.

The dynamics also appear to be shifting some workers away from formal center- and home-based employment settings toward private households in work as a babysitter, nanny or au pair. Those shifts may reduce the total number of spots a day care can offer.

“Pay is often under the table, and there’s no formal regulation of this sector,” Herbst said. “We don’t know if it’s high quality, if it’s low quality, how good the pay is — but what it is is less visible, and workers may feel less vulnerable as a result.”

The drop in foreign-born child care workers is most pronounced among highly educated immigrants and those from Mexico. There’s also a 30 percent decrease among Hispanic workers, particularly Mexican workers, born in the United States. ICE agents have also detained U.S. citizens amid widespread arrests.

“ICE arrests are having chilling effects on groups that are not eligible for deportation,” Herbst said. “U.S.-born workers of any race or ethnicity are not eligible for deportation, and the fact that we’re seeing reductions in U.S.-born employment among Hispanics, in particular Mexicans, speaks potentially to this chilling effect that ICE is having on these workers.”

Herbst said the administration sold mass deportations on the theory that they would unclog the labor market and create more job opportunities for Americans. That’s not what is playing out in the child care industry, which shows how immigrants and U.S. citizens don’t always compete for the same jobs.

“When a foreign-born worker is not showing up to work anymore because they’re scared, it makes the U.S.-born worker in that program — it makes it more difficult for them to do their jobs because they are doing complementary tasks rather than serving as substitutes for one another.”

The changes to the child care workforce are also impacting employment opportunities among U.S. mothers with preschool-aged children, especially White mothers and those who are highly educated.

“Parents, mothers in particular, rely on having stable child care available in order to work. And

when you increase instability in the child care market, essentially by ramping up immigration enforcement, you’re scaring the heck out of a lot of workers who are no longer going to show up,” Herbst said. “Because of that, the nation’s ability to provide child care services has declined. Families can no longer find the needed child care to go to work, and as a result, we’re seeing in the data, there are fewer mothers employed.”

This is not the first time researchers have examined the impact of immigration enforcement on child care. A federal program aimed at checking the immigration status of people arrested by local police and in effect between 2008 and 2013 also reduced the foreign-born child care work force and decreased the workforce among American mothers with young children.

Trump has made mass immigrant deportation a central policy during his second term. The scope of related arrests and subsequent detentions has included people without criminal backgrounds, including pregnant and postpartum people, and reached into locations once deemed sensitive by the federal government like schools, hospitals and churches.

Trump’s policy decision to rescind “sensitive location” status for places like day cares has translated into more immigration enforcement arrests near centers. A recent arrest of a day care worker inside a Chicago area center as children watched garnered national outrage.

Immigration arrests are expected to continue in the new year. Congress approved a massive tax law last summer that included $170 billion over the next four years for immigration enforcement, including for detentions and deportations. Researchers believe as ICE hires more officers and ramps up arrests, the child care sector could be further harmed.

Herbst said he expects disruptions not just to the child care sector but to other industries that are immigrant intensive.

“What I hope our paper does is start to get people thinking about the trade offs involved in this kind of immigration enforcement policy,” he said. “It’s been sold to us as a policy that’s going to be a boon for American workers, for U.S.-born workers. But I think what we’re finding is that there are trade offs.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice-childcare.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 14:58:30.483144

In her ruling, Judge Paula Xinis of the U.S. District Court in Maryland ordered that Abrego be released from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, citing a lack of a final order of removal for him.

“His removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,” Xinis wrote in a memo. She continued, “Since Abrego Garcia’s wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority.”

The ruling Thursday is the latest in a case that has highlighted the Trump administration’s enforcement policies in pursuit of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

The case first gained international attention when federal government officials admitted in April that they had made an “administrative error” that landed Abrego in the notorious Salvadoran megaprison — known as CECOT — even though a 2019 court order barred authorities from deporting him to his native El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that Abrego is a member of MS-13, a Salvadoran gang, who should not be allowed to stay in the United States. Abrego’s family and attorneys have denied the gang affiliation accusations, also adding that he has not been convicted of any crimes.

Government officials have continued their efforts to remove Abrego from the U.S. under new third-country deportation policies. Court records show the Trump administration has discussed deporting Abrego to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Costa Rica.

President Trump has repeatedly said that in enforcing immigration policy, he would deport criminals, rapists and the worst of the worst. But new data reveals that in the first nine months of the president's second term, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 74,000 people with no criminal record. That's more than a third of the total ICE arrests in that period. Those numbers were provided by ICE to the Deportation Data Project, a joint initiative of UCLA and UC Berkeley Law and analyzed by NPR. For more, I spoke to Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. And I started by asking him what this says about the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement.

ARIEL RUIZ SOTO: Well, at first, it contradicts the earlier messaging from the Trump administration that it's focused on the worst to the worst and targeting criminal convictions. However, recently, the administration has also said that anybody here in the United States without legal status will be subject to deportation in the future.

FADEL: Well, let's get to what is a crime and what's not. We hear from the administration not just the claims that they're arresting rapists and gang members, but also, they say that anyone in the country without proper paperwork is a criminal. Is that true that being undocumented means you've committed a crime?

RUIZ SOTO: Under immigration law, entering the country without proper authorization is a lower offense compared to those that we colloquially think are criminal convictions in a more criminal system, meaning, for example, murder, rape, drug abuse or something else like that that could get it to be higher.

FADEL: What do we know about the other two-thirds of these arrests? Do they all have criminal histories?

RUIZ SOTO: No. Among the other two-thirds, about half of those are actually people with a criminal pending charge but not yet proven guilty. Of those that do have a criminal conviction, we know from previous reports from ICE and experience that we've done research on that the majority of those criminal convictions tend to be traffic violations or lower-level offenses.

FADEL: Was that surprising to you?

RUIZ SOTO: I didn't think it was surprising because it's been happening over months. I think the visibility has been surprising. And perhaps the other aspect of this that has been also not transparent is this is just for ICE arrests. We don't know yet how many arrests are being made by Border Patrol across the different cities they're now targeting to consider the full impact of this new enforcement.

FADEL: What has this meant for immigrant communities, mixed-status communities and families when it comes to their presence in the United States and their relationship with law enforcement and the government?

RUIZ SOTO: Well, the direct impact is on those people that are here without status. Many of them are not going outside their homes. But I think the bigger impact here is that mixed-status families are also affected. The fact, for example, that families may forgo seeking benefits that are eligible for their U.S. citizen children because they're afraid of potentially being detained or arrested, that actually has implications for U.S. citizens and many of these citizens. In fact, 5.3 million U.S. citizen children have one parent who is undocumented in the United States, and that could actually make a significant difference in their separation.

FADEL: What would you say to people listening who say, well, I mean, people should not have entered without status, and this is the consequence?

RUIZ SOTO: Well, it's clear that migrants who are here without status are subject to deportation and arrest, but people have access to due process. They need to have an opportunity to present their claims to why they should stay in the United States. And if in the end of that litigation, it is determined that the person has to leave the United States, and that should be the case.

FADEL: Ariel Ruiz Soto is a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Thank you so much for your time.

RUIZ SOTO: Thank you.

FADEL: We reached out to ICE for comment and have not heard back. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

In the spring of last year, then-President Joe Biden tried to convince skeptical voters that the struggling economy was healthy. Then-candidate Donald Trump seized on the moment and vowed to lower prices for American consumers, beating his eventual Democratic rival Kamala Harris in part with a winning economic message.

Now it's President Trump who's trying to persuade the public that the state of the economy is sound, after prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in September and with consumers spending less on big-ticket items.

Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, says making that argument could be a tall order in the face of rising costs for a number of goods and services.

""My personal takeaway from the experience we had [in 2024] was that you can't tell people that prices aren't up when they're up,"" she said.

While the prices of some items such as gasoline have fallen on Trump's watch, the overall cost of living has continued to climb. For example, grocery costs are up 2.7% for the year ending in September and electricity costs have jumped more than 5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Trump's claims about inflation are false,"" Stevenson said, ""and you can go to the grocery store and see it yourself.""

But, in a wide-ranging speech to supporters on Tuesday, Trump both defended his administration's track record on the economy and said that talk of affordability was overblown. Trump told the crowd in Mount Pocono, Pa., that he believed the term ""affordability"" was a ""hoax"" perpetrated by Democrats. Trump's recent assertions dismissing inflation are not backed by official government economic data.

Consumers are feeling high prices firsthand

While it's true that inflation hit a 9% high during the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, that was during the pandemic and it dropped significantly after that. Inflation dipped to an annual rate of 3% in January during Biden's final month in office, the same rate it was in September under Trump.

Now many voters are questioning how well Trump is tackling the stubbornly high costs of everyday items. Some 57% of voters said in a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released this week that Trump was ""losing the battle against inflation,"" while 68% of respondents to a AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October said the economy was poor or very poor.

Voters' souring attitudes on the Trump administration's handling of the economy come less than a year before the U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans will aim to maintain their majorities in both houses of Congress. But in a warning sign for the GOP, November's odd-year races saw Democrats who campaigned on affordability win major contests in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey.

Political consultant and pollster Frank Luntz says Trump risks appearing out of touch if he continues to claim that affordability is a ""hoax"" when Americans feel like they're paying more — and actually do pay more.

""When you talk about affordability, it is all perception,"" Luntz told NPR's Morning Edition. ""The greatest danger is if you tell people happy days are here again, and it's 1929,"" he added, referencing the beginning of the Great Depression.

Luntz added that Trump blaming Biden for the failures of the economy may have worked during the campaign season and even for some time after.

""That said, it's now a year since the election, and the public does expect this administration to take charge. At a certain point, they will not accept the blame game,"" he said.

Trump's tariffs are contributing to inflation

But getting inflation to slow down or prices to drop will be easier said than done for the Trump administration, which has embraced economic policies such as tariffs that force prices upward, according to Stevenson. Trump and other administration officials have argued that tariffs are necessary to correct past global trade policies that have been unfair to the U.S. and to bring back domestic manufacturing.

Although tariffs are raising about $30 billion per month in revenue for U.S. coffers, the new import taxes levied by the Trump administration have increased prices on a number of items, from food to clothing to furniture.

""What I find surprising is that he's out there telling people: 'This isn't happening. This is a con job. There's no affordability problem,'"" Stevenson said. ""At the same time, he's pursuing policies that are purposefully restricting supply, which every person who has taken even an introductory economics course knows will push up prices.""

Still, the administration has taken several steps recently to ease the negative effects of tariffs on U.S. consumers and producers. Last month, Trump scrapped the tariffs on certain products that aren't widely produced in the U.S., such as bananas and coffee. And on Monday the administration announced that it was making $12 billion in one-time payments to U.S. farmers to offset their rising business costs.

Rosalía's LUX is NPR Music's No. 1 album of 2025

At the moment this fall when NPR Music's staff began discussing our picks for the best albums of 2025, the mere existence of the record we'd eventually name our No. 1 — in a landslide, it must be said — was not known to anyone on our team. But as soon as we heard Rosalía's magnificent, head-spinning LUX in early November, one spot on our list was instantly confirmed.

For most of the year, consensus felt hard to come by. We all found plenty of music to love, but we weren't always drawn toward the same signals. LUX was different. Of the dozen critics and hosts who submitted lists (you can, and should, check out each of their lists, starting with their highest recommendations here), more than half included it in their top 10. Four of us said it was the best thing we heard all year. Below, each of them makes the argument for why it deserves that crown.

LUX is high art

It's hard to describe Rosalía's artiest and most audacious left turn without rattling off statistics and credentials. ""She sings in more than a dozen languages!"" ""She's working with the London Symphony Orchestra, and also Björk, and did you know that Caroline Shaw helped with arrangements?!"" A work rich in footnotes, LUX spills over with lore about female saints, enhanced by efforts to translate, unpack and otherwise reckon with it.

LUX is a work of high art, sure. But it's also frequently, boldly, at times breathtakingly beautiful — a work of craft and care, empathy and deep emotion. ""Reliquia"" mutates from an orchestral piece into an electro-pop reverie, with a tear-jerking piano interlude along the way, and its vocal remains pristine enough to induce gasps. That's just one song among 18. — Stephen Thompson

LUX transcends genre

Taking the full measure of what Rosalía pulls off on LUX is like trying to solve a single-line logic puzzle: Connect opera to maximalist pop to flamenco to electronica to Baroque orchestral music to rap (and much more) without lifting your pen or crossing any lines. It feels impossible. But Rosalía shows how with a profoundly stirring, unified feast for the ears. It's less reggaeton or bachata and more like reggaeton and bachata and Sigur Rós performing Les Misérables, with Feist and Maria Callas trading lead vocals.

But LUX isn't just sonic gymnastics. Deeply considered and exhaustively researched, it's a monument to both the incomprehensible mess and breathtaking wonder of being human, shifting seamlessly between fragile beauty and childlike magic to raw, lustful desire. It's as graphic and startling as it is rapturous and divine. And yeah, it's performed in 13 different languages, as Rosalía delivers a vast exegesis on everything from religion and sex to mortality and violence.

Arriving near the end of a brutally divisive year of attacks on identity and ""otherness,"" LUX feels — and sounds — like the best possible reply, a necessary and potent reminder of the humanity that binds us and the miracle of being here at all. — Robin Hilton

LUX belongs in a lineage with one of the most beloved jazz albums of all time

After listening to LUX for the first time, I spent days trying to understand why it felt both new and familiar. Then it hit me: The more I listened and read Rosalía's deeply personal lyrics, the more it reminded me of jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's seminal spiritual statement, A Love Supreme.

Hear me out.

Rosalía prepared herself for this moment by dividing her album into four parts, exploring feminine mysticism, transformation, transcendence and intimacy, subjects that curiously echo A Love Supreme's album track listings of ""Acknowledgement,"" ""Resolution,"" ""Pursuance"" and ""Psalm.""

By the time Coltrane recorded A Love Supreme in 1964, he had already experienced what he called a spiritual awakening that helped him kick addictions to alcohol and heroin, while exploring the sonic and musical limits of his saxophone. A Love Supreme is his moment of coming face to face with God. On LUX, after almost an hour's worth of intense and very musical meditations on things like feminine mysticism, light versus dark as well as spirituality and sacredness, Rosalía also comes face to face with God. But she asks God to meet her halfway: ""God descends and I ascend / We meet in the middle.""

Both of these albums are artfully crafted statements by artists with uncommon powers of musical communication who share with us spiritual journeys so personal that at times they feel like invasions of privacy. LUX meets the musical legacy of A Love Supreme in the middle and picks up where that classic left off. — Felix Contreras

LUX is still, at its heart, a spectacular flamenco record

Flamenco feels like the sonic representation of the moment when Eve took a bite of the apple. Cast in an ancient fire so alive it's impossible to put out or pin down, its deceptiveness is its defiance. As experimental, big and seemingly novel as Rosalía's LUX is, it sounds like one thing: her spirit. Which — as she's chameleoned across the world — stays firmly rooted in flamenco's eternal flame.

She approached this record as she does all others: global eyes, an open heart and a Spanish soul. Flamenco is pastoral music, once used for basic communication and connection. Those original sounds — sweet lyrical lullabies and softly stroked strings — gave into temptation and fell in love with pain, fear, sadness, giving way to guttural cries and desperate strums.

On LUX, there's something beyond technical ingenuity or global experience to the way the music — and its maker — morphs from track to track. What ties an entire world of sounds and languages together is an artist who enters a sonic moment and complicates it, tears it down, ruining beautiful things with a deep human-ness. Flamenco is etched in concrete yet almost always vibrating, changing; striking palms cutting up some of the most shape-shifting, dynamic vocals on Earth. Ten notes within one, a hundred emotions in two breaths. Despite apparent sonic distance, LUX may be Rosalía's most flamenco album yet. — Anamaria Sayre

Subsidies for the Affordable Care Act appear set to expire for millions of Americans at the end of the year after competing health care related bills failed to advance in the Senate on Thursday.

The outcome was widely expected after Democrats and Republicans chose to release separate partisan proposals. Both parties are under pressure to address health care costs before the expiration of federal subsidies meant to lower the cost of premiums on ACA plans. Those subsidies expire at the end of 2025 and are expected to cause prices to skyrocket.

Both bills needed 60 votes to advance, but neither succeeded.

The Republican-backed plan failed by a vote of 51 to 48. The measure, authored by Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, would have provided up to $1,500 a year in payments for health savings accounts for Americans earning less than 700% of the federal poverty level.

However the bill would not have extended the ACA tax credits and the money could not be used to pay for health care premiums. Deductibles for those plans average around $7,000, according to data from the health policy organization KFF.

Democrats rejected the bill arguing it did nothing to address health care premiums, and opposed restrictions in the bill on abortion and gender affirming care.

""The Republican plan is a when you get sick, you go broke plan plain and simple,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said ahead of the vote.

In a trade-off to reopen the government following the longest shutdown in U.S. history, Senate Republicans promised Democrats a vote on a bill of their choosing to extend the subsidies. Democrats proposed a three-year extension of existing federal subsidies, but that measure failed 51 to 48. Four Republicans joined with Democrats: Susan Collins of Maine, Missouri's Josh Hawley, and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.

Republicans have argued that extending the subsidies would allow what they describe as Obamacare ""waste, fraud and abuse"" to continue, while lining the pockets of insurance companies.

""There is nothing in their [Democrats] bill that stops billions of dollars in fraudulent spending,"" Cassidy said on the Senate floor Wednesday.

The failed votes on Thursday left the future of the ACA subsidies even further in doubt. GOP leaders in the House are signaling a potential vote in coming days on legislation to address health care costs, but the party has yet to coalesce behind a plan.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said that starting next week, the House would begin voting ""on bills that will focus on lowering premiums for 100% of Americans.""

""Let's see where Democrats stand when its not just giving money to insurance companies and propping up failed Obamacare plans,"" Scalise said.

The fight over the subsidies has once again exposed a split inside the GOP over how to control rising healthcare costs — a debate that has snarled the party since the ACA first passed in 2010.

While some Republicans say they are prepared to watch the subsidies lapse, others have joined with Democrats to press for an extension. In the House, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., has partnered with Jared Golden, D-Maine, on a plan to extend the credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. A separate plan from Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., would extend the subsidies for one year. The bill has more than a dozen Republican cosponsors.

Both proposals were filed through a rare legislative tactic known as a discharge petition — a workaround that lets members force a vote without the approval of leadership or committees if they can first secure 218 signatures in support.

For his part, President Trump has largely remained hands off. He has been sharply critical of the ACA subsidies, and while he has not endorsed a specific proposal he has voiced support for sending money directly to Americans to pay for care.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed7ceab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5777x3033+0+409/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F17%2F6b9b830a45e59c8845b764e9a3b1%2Fgettyimages-2226391006.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:58:35.752575

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.”

Justice Department and Homeland Security spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the judge’s order. Messages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia’s attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager.

When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

In President Donald Trump’s simple and provocative language, Somali immigrants to the US, even US citizens, are “garbage.”

“Send her back!” was the chant from supporters about Rep. Ilhan Omar, the elected member of Congress, at a campaign-style event Tuesday night.

“Throw her the hell out!” Trump said.

This is a complaint about legal immigration

Trump also reminded everyone of the episode in his first term when he complained that the US was accepting immigrants from “shithole” countries.

“Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden?” Trump asked the Pennsylvania crowd. “Send us some nice people, do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Stephen Miller, the White House aide who seems to hold outsized authority over much of Trump’s agenda, in particular on immigration, expanded on these ideas on Fox News in an interview earlier Tuesday.

Both Miller and Trump have seized upon a growing pandemic relief scandal in Minnesota to disparage the entire Somali immigrant community, much of which came to the country legally beginning in the 1990s.

Pining for the pre-Civil Rights era

Miller suggested the country was better off with strict quotas that sought to preserve the racial makeup of the country in the 1920s and favored immigrants from Western and Northern Europe over what he called “third world countries.”

That period was, in Miller’s view, the “cauldron through which a unified shared national identity was formed.” He drew a line between the great events in that 50-year period of US history and negative migration. Back then, it was Swedish immigrants living in the Minneapolis neighborhood where Somalis have now settled.

A law that changed the country

The legislation was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the Statue of Liberty in 1965, and its goal was to prioritize skills and abilities of legal immigrants. Previous law had demanded that the racial and cultural makeup of the country not be changed as a result of immigration.

“It corrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American nation,” Johnson said at the time.

He argued the system of quotas based on country of origin violated the founding precept of the country:

JOHNSON: Men of needed skill and talent were denied entrance because they came from southern or eastern Europe or from one of the developing continents. This system violated the basic principle of American democracy — the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.

Immigration surged, primarily from Latin America and Asia, while European immigration fell.

A key moment for Civil Rights

The historian Mark Updegrove, who is CEO of the LBJ Presidential Library, puts the immigration law alongside the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act as key pieces of Civil Rights legislation that changed the country.

“What LBJ said is that we shouldn’t be asking people where they’re from; we should be asking people what can you do for our country,” he said. “It opened up opportunities for people who, to that point, had been banned from coming to the United States simply by virtue of their ethnicity or country of origin, which is ridiculous.”

The law also represented one of the few times Congress has been able to come together to address immigration in a comprehensive way.

‘Third world countries’

Miller’s complaint, expressed on Fox News, is that the 1965 law attracted more people from “third world” countries who he argued have failed to assimilate in the US.

“What you saw between 1965 and today was the single largest experiment on a society, on a civilization, that had ever been conducted in human history,” Miller argued.

In his view, immigrant groups like Somali-Americans, who sought refuge in Minnesota starting in the 1990s, failed as Americans. And he said their natural born citizen children have also failed. On natural born citizenship, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to ignore the plain language of what’s in the Constitution.

“With a lot of these immigrant groups, not only is the first generation unsuccessful — again, Somalia is a clear example … but you see very persistent issues in every subsequent generation. You see consistent high rates of welfare use, high rates of criminal activity, consistent failures to assimilate.”

CNN’s recent reporting, on the other hand, suggests Minnesota is still welcoming to the Somali immigrants, most of them now citizens having natural born citizen children.

A nod to replacement theory

That’s not what Miller sees, for either Somalis or other immigrant groups. Think back to when Trump falsely accused Haitian immigrants legally in the US of eating dogs in Ohio. Borrowing, at least in spirit, from the objectively racist concept of replacement theory, Miller said immigrants from “third world” countries are going to bring the US down.

“It’s just common sense. If Somalians cannot make Somalia successful, why would that we think that the track record would be any different in the United States?” he said, pointing also to immigrants from other African countries.

“If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country, what do you think will happen? You will replicate the conditions they left,” he said.

Immigration as the root problem of many US problems

Miller, becoming animated, pointed to education, health care, public safety and deficit spending, which is just about the waterfront of societal issues.

MILLER: If you subtract immigration out of test scores, all of a sudden our test scores skyrocket! If you subtract immigration out of health care, all of a sudden we don’t have near to the size of the health care challenges our country faces. If you subtract immigration out of public safety, all of a sudden we don’t have violent crime in so many of our cities. Issue after issue we talk about these things as they things just happen to us. The schools just suddenly fail. Violent crime just suddenly explodes. The deficit just suddenly skyrockets. These are a result of social policy choices that we made through immigration.

Miller’s argument lacks evidence

I put Miller’s comments to David Bier, a critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policy at the libertarian-leaning CATO institute. Bier disagreed, to put it mildly.

“His views are baseless smears based on bias, not serious analysis,” he told me by email, adding a point-by-point deconstruction of what Miller said.

BIER: Immigrants to the United States today are assimilating faster than prior generations. They are more likely to know English, more likely to have graduated college, are more economically productive, and more beneficial to government budgets than in the early 20th century. They have more experience with democracy than past waves of immigration, and they are more patriotic and more supportive of US institutions than the US-born. By the time they naturalize they have adopted almost the same political views, except for immigration policy. They are less likely to commit crimes and be incarcerated than those in the early 20th century. Immigrants today cost less to the health care system than the US-born. They are less likely to commit and be incarcerated for crimes than the US-born. Immigrants increase the returns to education for the US-born, leading more US-born to graduate. They make the US-born more productive, increasing their wages and living standards.

Imprinted all over Trump’s policies

Regardless of whether his views are based in fact, Miller’s outlook is consistently repeated in Trump’s policies, which frequently conflate legal and undocumented immigrants from countries like Somalia.

Republicans cited unverified allegations of widespread fraud to cut future Medicaid and food assistance spending. Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security has indicated she will expand a travel ban from 19 countries to include “every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Immigration paranoia fuels a new ‘Trump corollary’

The larger issue of immigration, including legal immigration, is also behind a more existential policy shift the US announced this week in a new National Security Strategy.

The document announces a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine that will see the US act against Western Hemisphere countries to make sure they are able to prevent mass migration to the US.

The document also seems to refer to migrant communities like Somalis in the US when it states that US sovereignty has been eroded by “the cynical manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to foreign interests within our country.”

‘Civilizational erasure’

The US warns in the National Security Strategy that Europe — ancestral home of the immigrants that Trump prefers — is threatened by “civilizational erasure,” an unsubtle reference to immigration to Europe.

“Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,” the document states, arguing such transformation could call into question whether European countries will remain as US allies.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2251063636.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-11 11:59:46.929933

Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that he has been in near-continuous confinement since March, when he was deported to El Salvador and held in prisons there.","Washington — A Maryland judge on Thursday ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year, from immigration custody.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis grants Abrego Garcia's habeas petition to release him from custody and is a significant victory for Abrego Garcia, whose immigration case became a major flashpoint in President Trump's mass-deportation campaign when he was removed to El Salvador earlier this year.

In her order, Xinis found that there was no final order of removal from the government to deport Abrego Garcia from the United States, despite the Trump administration's repeated attempts to remove him.

""Because respondents have no statutory authority to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country absent a removal order, his removal cannot be considered reasonably foreseeable, imminent, or consistent with due process,"" Xinis wrote in Thursday's order.

""Although respondents may eventually get it right, they have not as of today,"" the judge continued. ""Thus, Abrego Garcia's detention for the stated purpose of third country removal cannot continue. Respondents' conduct over the past months belie that his detention has been for the basic purpose of effectuating removal, lending further support that Abrego Garcia should be held no longer.""

The Trump administration has been attempting to re-deport Abrego Garcia to the African nations of Uganda, Eswatini or Ghana, but the countries have not agreed to accept him.

But the administration informed the court in October that Liberia had agreed to take Abrego Garcia and would seek to deport him.

The administration has ""received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in October that unless Liberia guarantees it will not send Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, deporting him to the West African nation ""is no less unlawful than sending him directly"" to his home country again.

In November, the Trump administration argued that Abrego Garcia had received significant due process in the U.S. In a court filing, the Justice Department said a U.S. government asylum officer interviewed Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.

Xinis heard testimony in October from an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the Trump administration's efforts to remove Abrego Garcia, who has been in immigration custody since late August. The official, John Schultz, said the administration remains in active discussions with Eswatini about removing him there, though the east African country rejected a request to take him.

Still, Schultz said that once the administration has received word of a third country willing to accept Abrego Garcia, it could deport him within 72 hours if allowed by the court.

Abrego Garcia has said he is willing to go to Costa Rica and designated the country as his preferred country of removal, and Costa Rica has indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency. But during the hearing Oct. 10, a Justice Department lawyer said there had not been discussions about deporting him there.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia accused the Trump administration of gamesmanship and deliberately seeking to remove him to countries where he could raise claims of reasonable fear of persecution, with the goal of keeping him detained for longer.

Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador in 2011 and has lived in Maryland with his wife and children. But he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported to his home country, despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to El Salvador because of possible persecution by local gangs.

As part of a civil case Abrego Garcia and his wife brought against the Trump administration, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return back to the U.S. But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty, and a judge in Tennessee ordered him to be released on bail ahead of a criminal trial set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because of concerns from his lawyers that immigration authorities would arrest him upon his release and deport him from the U.S.

Abrego Garcia was released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland. But days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he may be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia also filed a new legal challenge to his confinement and the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for a second time, which Xinis is presiding over. She has blocked immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S., and he has since remained in detention at a facility in Pennsylvania.

At the heart of Abrego Garcia's challenge is a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which the high court said the government cannot indefinitely detain a person in the U.S. illegally if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the ""reasonably foreseeable future.""

Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that he has been in near-continuous confinement since March, when he was deported to El Salvador and held in prisons there. His only period of freedom was for a weekend in August, in between his release from criminal custody in Tennessee and his arrest by immigration authorities in Maryland.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/08/7f0831b1-601f-433c-9e87-10208071fbb3/thumbnail/1200x630/ed71cb49184cd94d44f5217522ef3c18/gettyimages-2231358090.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 10:57:07.049217

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to testify before the House Committee on Homeland Security at 10 a.m. EST. Watch live in our video player above.

It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department’s tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump’s signature policy area, Thursday’s appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.

In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem’s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.

The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.

Noem’s department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.

The secretary’s appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador.

Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. Homeland Security says agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations do not target or arrest American citizens for immigration reasons although they say they have arrested Americans for allegedly interfering in enforcement operations.

And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

Also attending Thursday’s hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.

Previous hearings have included questions on cybersecurity, China, chemical security and drones. Under President Joe Biden, at times of heavy migration at the southern border, Republicans often focused their questioning on his Democratic administration’s handling of border security.

When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen.

Transcript

Part I

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: The United States has more than 24 million naturalized citizens. These are people who were born in other countries, but have made America their home. 24 million naturalized citizens is basically one out of every 13 people in the United States. Now, the Trump administration says it is prioritizing denaturalization.

Also known as stripping some of those people of their citizenship.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, we have criminals that came into our country and they were naturalized, maybe through Biden or somebody that didn't know what they were doing. If I have the power to do it, I'm not sure that I do, but if I do, I would denaturalize, absolutely.

CHAKRABARTI: President Trump speaking to reporters on Air Force one Late last month. And back in June, the U.S. Justice Department released a memo citing denaturalization as a top law enforcement priority. So when and how can the United States government actually revoke citizenship? And does Trump's claim about the danger posed by naturalized Americans really hold up?

Joining us now is Ahilan Arulanantham. He's a professor at the University of California Los Angeles Law School and Faculty co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA. Professor, welcome to On Point.

AHILAN ARULANANTHAM: Thank you for having me, Meghna.

CHAKRABARTI: I do apologize for screwing up your last name, with a name like Chakrabarti you think I would've gotten it right, but I want to get this right.

ARULANANTHAM: No worries.

CHAKRABARTI: Arulanantham.

ARULANANTHAM: Arulanantham.

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) Arulanantham. Am I dragging you back to your childhood where people ask you where you're from?

ARULANANTHAM: I'm like Chakrabarti, Chakrabarti.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Fair enough. Alright, so let's get down to actually this quite serious matter of the government amping up its efforts at denaturalization.

Let's get straight to the president's question that he said. I don't know if I have the power as president to denaturalize. Does he or does he not?

ARULANANTHAM: The power to denaturalize does exist in our law, but it's very limited. A person who makes a false statement during the naturalization process, and that false statement is critical to whether or not they would've actually been able to naturalize can be denaturalized.

So for example, if someone says on the application that they have been a green card holder for five years, but in fact they were only a green card holder for one year, then the government can go back and denaturalize that person. But I think there's two important points to recognize about the limit of that power.

One is it's wrong to suggest that just ordinary criminal convictions can be the basis for denaturalization. Because they're not, somebody who's been a naturalized citizen and then is convicted of a crime, they go to prison just like other citizens. But the fact that you've been convicted of a crime by itself does not render you eligible for denaturalization.

The fact that you've been convicted of a crime by itself does not render you eligible for denaturalization.

AHILAN ARULANANTHAM

And in that way, it's very different from deportation for non-citizens. Many crimes can result in people losing their immigration status, including even their green cards. But that's not the case for people who have naturalized. And then the second thing, which is important to recognize, is denaturalization happen[s] in federal court.

Not an immigration court. And the government can't fire the federal judges if they don't like what they're doing, as they're doing with immigration judges right now. Unfortunately. And so that means that most of the protections available in criminal cases are available in denaturalization cases.

Not all of them. There's probably not a right to appointed counsel. Depending on how the government charges a denaturalization, but almost everything else, including the very high burden of proof and the fact that all the process that's normally afforded in federal court is afforded to people in denaturalization proceedings.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so let's just clarify a couple things here. First and foremost, it is quite straightforward, as far as I read it, that if you commit fraud during your citizenship process, and that's discovered later by the federal government, that is a basis for denaturalization. Yes?

ARULANANTHAM: If the fraud would've rendered you ineligible.

CHAKRABARTI: For citizenship?

ARULANANTHAM: For citizenship, yeah. So most of the time, that's often going to be true, but occasionally it's not. If you lied about for some other reason, like to protect your husband, which is what the last Supreme Court case was about on the subject, then not. But yes, many of the frauds that you might expect would arise in this kind of situation.

Lying about something that mattered to whether or not you get your citizenship, that can be a basis, yes.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Does that extend to lying about whether or not you have a criminal record?

ARULANANTHAM: Only if the crime would've rendered you ineligible to naturalize. And not every crime does that. Some crimes don't.

It depends.

CHAKRABARTI: And then so similarly about the specificity of a committed crime. If after you become a U.S. citizen and you do commit a crime, you said for ordinary crimes, denaturalization is not an option for the federal government. But that still leaves extraordinary crimes that you could possibly lose your citizenship.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah. Extremely narrow ground for crimes, it is a charged as a federal crime, actually. I'm trying to remember the number. It might be 1451, I can't remember, but it's a federal crime, which is the crime of having obtained naturalization by fraud. That's the thing that I'm thinking of.

Lots of other crimes, if we're talking about post-naturalization conduct. Like after you become a citizen, you then engage in whatever, drug trafficking, fraud, terrorism, whatever it may be. Those are not going to be a basis for denaturalization. The government would have to show that there was actually something you said in your naturalization application from before, before the criminal activity occurred.

That was a false statement, and that would've rendered you ineligible in order to then try and connect the two things up and take away your citizenship.

And as a practical matter, that doesn't happen. You don't see cases, naturalization cases that happen on that basis.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So again, I think this process is so little understood in part because how often does it actually happen?

ARULANANTHAM: The number of cases are really rare. In the first Trump administration it was something like 25 cases a year that I think actually were charged. Which is not even a drop in the bucket when you think about all of the federal criminal cases happening, let alone all the deportation cases happening.

And that itself was a very big increase from prior years. Roughly double. I think before that It'd been like 10, 15 cases a year. So it's very rare. A lot of the small number of cases that have existed have focused on war criminals, famously Nazis who had lied about whether or not they were part of the Nazis when they came to the U.S.

And for example, like I said, the last Supreme Court case about this was about a Bosnian Serb who her husband had been involved in a war crime in Bosnia. So it's things like that, that the government has gone after people for, a very small number.

CHAKRABARTI: So is it fair to say that, what, less than 50 a year?

ARULANANTHAM: Yes. The last data I'm aware of is that it's well below that, it's like around 25 cases a year.

CHAKRABARTI: Out of the 24 million naturalized citizens in the United States.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah. Very small number.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay.

ARULANANTHAM: Of course, that --

CHAKRABARTI: No, go ahead.

ARULANANTHAM: Sorry. Just say one other thing about that. It doesn't mean that there couldn't be an attempt to vastly increase this number of cases. And of course you can have a huge amount of harassment and abuse of people if you bring criminal charges or civil denaturalization charges against them, even if they don't have a lot of merit and don't ultimately result in someone losing their citizenship. The government can do a tremendous amount of damage to people by bringing cases that are extremely weak.

So I don't want to say that this isn't something that couldn't arise in the future, but the legal basis to do it would be very flimsy, I think, to do large scale denaturalization attempts.

CHAKRABARTI: Yes. In fact, that's exactly why we're doing this show, right? Because the Trump administration has made a lot of very clear noises or statements about wanting to expand the number of people it seeks to denaturalize in this country.

And we'll talk about what, by what legal basis or policy basis they could do that. But I'd like to actually for a second if I could talk about what specifically in this June 11th memo from the Department of Justice that I referenced earlier, that said they're going to put denaturalization as a top law enforcement priority.

And let me just read a little bit from the beginning of this memo. And the memo was put out by Brett Shumate. He's the Assistant Attorney General of the United States. And in section one, it says, it references an executive order put out by President Trump called ""Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.""

Which establishes, quote: ""The policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and ... promote individual initiative excellence and hard work.""

And then the memo goes on and says: ""To this end, the president ordered all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities. As part of these efforts, attorney General Bondi has directed that the Justice Department align its litigating positions with the requirement of equal dignity and respect.""

That's an interesting way to start a memo that has to do with seeking to denaturalize more foreign-born Americans.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah. I don't know where to start with that one. I mean there's so many ways in which this administration has turned the kind of politics and policy of anti-discrimination on its head.

The president decries racism, but then repeats conspiracies about, racist conspiracies against immigrants, ends the refugee program except for white South Africans, rants against Somalis and repeats lies about Haitians eating cats and dog dogs.

I could go on and on. And unfortunately, it's not just in the statements, but it does also play out in very real ways. In policy, in the statements of the administration. So that opening to me just sounds like that, it sounds similar to many other statements that the administration has made in the context of immigration policy, civil rights enforcement, affirmative action, anti-Semitism, all of those things.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: Let's hear now from a voice who supports the Trump administration's efforts. Laura Ries. She believes that the Trump administration focus on revoking citizenship from foreign born Americans is the right idea.

Ries is director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation.

LAURA RIES: Naturalization, U.S. citizenship is the most important immigration benefit that we can confer on someone coming to the U.S. and choosing to stay here. And so we want to make sure that they are truly worthy of receiving that tremendous benefit and that they not benefit from ill-gotten gains.

CHAKRABARTI: Now, of course, the Heritage Foundation is the primary architect behind Project 2025, which specifically mentions denaturalization in its own document. Pages 143 and 144, specifically, if you want to take a look. Project 2025 advocates for, quote: ""Re-implementation of the USCIS Denaturalization Unit. An effort to maintain integrity in the system by identifying and prosecuting criminal and civil denaturalization cases in combination with the Department of Justice for aliens who obtain citizenship through fraud and other illicit means."" End quote.

Now, the Heritage Foundation's Laura Ries says she agrees with many of the categories Trump's Justice Department says it is prioritizing like people who have engaged in torture, war crimes or human rights violations.

RIES: During Biden's four years, when we experienced the highest numbers ever of people coming to the U.S., it showed us that people from all over the world want to come to the U.S. in very large numbers.

That means we can be, and we should be very choosy about who we say can come here and can stay here. Let alone who we're going to give U.S. citizenship to. If you are harming other people, harming Americans, lying about those activities, then no, you should not be given U.S. citizenship. And if you were given it, then that should be taken away.

CHAKRABARTI: Ries says, revoking citizenship for people, or excuse me, revoking citizenship from people could also, in her view, help protect against future immigration fraud.

RIES: Immigration fraud writ large, not just citizenship, is a problem. Because it is for so long, been low risk and high reward. The likelihood that you're caught or punished for it is extremely low, and the benefit of staying here is extremely high.

And that's just a recipe for fraud, and so people do exploit it, including citizenship. If you want to change behavior, change future behavior for other applicants, then you want to send the message that if you commit fraud to get an immigration benefit, you're not going to continue to benefit from that.

CHAKRABARTI: We asked Reese whether she worries that the Justice Department memo could be a slippery slope to the administration simply targeting people it does not like or agree with, and possibly revoking their citizenship.

RIES: No. I'm not worried about it. I think there's enough work to be done in the categories higher up the list, whether that is gang membership, terrorism, supporting terrorism, war crimes, et cetera, et cetera, fraud.

These cases are not easy and they're not quick. So I'm not concerned about it being done for any old reason.

CHAKRABARTI: That's Laura Ries, director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation. Now, of course, the Heritage Foundation is in the news quite a lot because of Project 2025 and how closely the Trump administration seems to be following a lot of the project's wishes or designs.

There's another note here we should mention about Heritage. In October, the organization's president Kevin Roberts defended Tucker Carlson's decision to interview white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Here's part of the video that Roberts posted on X, where he called Tucker Carlson a close friend.

KEVIN ROBERTS: The venomous coalition attacking him or sowing division, their attempt to cancel him will fail. I disagree with and even abhor things that Nick Fuentes says. But canceling him is not the answer either. Conservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.

CHAKRABARTI: Roberts faced considerable blowback for that statement, including from conservatives and from folks within the Heritage Foundation. He then said the script for his video had been written by a staffer who was reportedly reassigned and has since left the Heritage Foundation. The day after the video posted, Roberts wrote on X: ""The Heritage Foundation and I denounce ... and stand against Nick Fuentes' vicious anti-Semitic ideology, his Holocaust denial and his relentless conspiracy theories that echo the darkest chapters of history."" End quote. He then posted another video in early November, and here's a part of that.

ROBERTS: My use of the phrase venomous coalition was a terrible choice of words. It caused justified concern, especially among friends and allies who know how seriously Heritage has fought and continues to fight against the rise of antisemitism. Everyone has the responsibility to speak up against the scourge of antisemitism, no matter the messenger. Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging.

CHAKRABARTI: At least six Heritage Foundation staffers have reportedly resigned after Roberts' comments. And so there, with that background, we went back to Laura Ries and asked her whether she agreed with Robert's initial defense of Tucker Carlson's interview of White nationalist Nick Fuentes and whether she agrees with Fuentes' views.

She declined to comment on either question.

Okay, so Professor Arulanantham. Let me ask you this. You heard Laura Ries there, first of all, state something which I think a lot of Americans agree with, that it's quite a privilege to become a naturalized citizen, and so therefore, should there actually be, in a sense, a higher standard for those citizens when they are discovered as having committed fraud or a crime post or even pre or post their naturalization.

What do you think about that?

ARULANANTHAM: I agree that it's a priceless a gift or blessing to be a U.S. citizen. It affords you the ability to travel all over the world and tells you to the protection of this government. And of course, allows you to stay here. So absolutely, I agree with that.

I have no problem in principle with the concept, not just even in principle, in practice with the concept, the people who got naturalization through fraud can be prosecuted for that. And if that's why they got it, so they were actually not eligible for it, then it should be taken away. But I think that's about the last place where I think I agreed with the statements from Laura Ries.

One thing, which I think is really important where we disagree, is I really do believe that if you want to change that rule and make it so that people who just commit crimes can be denaturalized as a result of that, then you really undermine the value that citizenship has, because it creates certain very basic guarantees that are available to everyone.

And now this would change and you'd have two classes of citizens. Those who are born here and those who are not. Of course, everybody, citizen or not, is subject to the criminal law. And if you commit a terrible crime, you should go to prison for a long time. But that doesn't mean that you lose your citizenship, and it shouldn't turn on something as accidental on where you were born, in my view.

That such that consequence would flow to one side of those people and not the other. The other thing where I think we really disagree is on the threat about selective enforcement and the idea that the administration would use the denaturalization power, if it were greatly expanded, to go after its enemies, to go after people from disfavored racial groups.

Sadly we have seen this administration do exactly that and it's used, excuse me, it's used the deportation power to do that, to go after people whose political views they didn't like when it came to Palestine. And actually, other political issues. To go after people who are engaged in advocating for the rights of immigrants. And of course, we've seen so much race discrimination from this administration just all across the board. So it's easy to imagine that this power would be used in the same kinds of ways, and that could lead to a lot more abuse as well.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. I wanna talk about now about how the Trump administration is seeking to expand the number of denaturalization cases it may pursue. Professor, hang on here for a second because to do that I wanna bring in Irina Manta. She's a law professor at Hofstra University. Professor Manta, welcome.

IRINA MANTA: Thank you so much. Thanks for having me.

CHAKRABARTI: I'm having unfortunately tough time with names today. I should say Professor Manta, forgive me.

MANTA: No worries.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, let's talk in more detail about what the Justice Department memo says about how and when they might seek denaturalization cases in federal court.

If both of you can just bear with me for a moment, I want to read through the list or an abridged list of the 10 types of crimes or instances where denaturalization would be pursued. The first is the one we've already talked about, individuals who pose a danger to national security, being parts of terrorist organizations, committing espionage against the United States, et cetera.

Then there's number two, cases against individuals who engage in torture war crimes. Also, still a longstanding area where you could get denaturalized. Then there's cases against individuals who further or furthered unlawful enterprise of criminal gangs or transnational criminal organizations or drug cartels.

Then another, number four is individuals who commit felonies that were not disclosed during the naturalization process, then there's individuals who committed human trafficking, sex offenses, or violent crimes. Then there's cases against individuals who engaged in forms of fraud against the United States, including the paycheck protection program or loan fraud.

Then cases against individuals who engaged in fraud against private individuals, funds or corporations. You could also be denaturalized if you acquired your naturalization through government corruption or fraud. There are cases that could be referred by a U.S. attorney's office in connection with pending criminal charges, but don't fit in the other categories I just read.

And then finally, number 10, the Justice Department could pursue denaturalization in cases referred to the civil division that the division determines sufficient and important to pursue. How much broader is that suite of 10 points? How much broader is that than what we have now in terms of when the federal government would try to denaturalize a U.S. citizen?

Professor Manta. Yeah, go ahead.

MANTA: I would say that one of the things that's very concerning about this list that's on the fourth page of that memo is that it's basically saying we're going to do things that are available under the current law, but then when it lists them, and here, I want to echo what Ahilan was saying earlier.

It doesn't actually explain, I think that's intentional, what the timing is of those offenses. Are we talking about things that happened before the person was naturalized? In which case, why do we have so many categories? Why isn't it just things that were not disclosed? Because presumably, if they were disclosed, it doesn't really make sense, like because the person wouldn't have gotten naturalized if it's one of these, let's say terrorism and all these different things.

And so I think here we have to go back to this idea that the administration at times is talking in a coded manner, like what you were talking about with the DEI term, that's a form of dog whistle in my view. And here this ambiguity is also, actually, I think trying to hint at the fact that they are going to expand things, that they are going to go beyond what statutory law would allow, and beyond what other administrations have done previously, and that it's going to try to go after everything and everyone in every possible way, including as Ahilan was pointing out, in ways that are harassing.

So I find the ambiguity and among other things of this memo very disconcerting. I don't trust it at all. Also, if we look at how other immigration matters have been handled this year by the federal government, including in unlawful ways, I'm very concerned.

CHAKRABARTI: In fact, from Ms. Ries at the Heritage Foundation a couple of minutes ago. We heard that one of the goals here is to make people think twice, right? About becoming naturalized citizens. And she was saying like that would effectively, the chilling effect would potentially reduce the number of people who they believe are dangerous to the United States from trying to become citizens. Professor Manta.

MANTA: Yes, I am getting that sense now. The memo, I'm afraid, goes even further than that. He's talking about things that are happening after naturalization. But absolutely there are any number of chilling effects that are in place here. One of them is the one that you mentioned, of just discouraging people from becoming citizens in the first place.

But another one is to basically get people to not express opinions that might not be pleasant to the current administration. People are afraid of ending up on the government's radar right now, even if they did nothing wrong. Even if they did nothing illegal, there was nothing wrong with the way that they went about immigrating and naturalizing.

But they don't want to end up in the cross hairs or have to go through some massive legal process. And if it's done on a civil basis, they might have to pay for their own lawyer. And so this is all could get very unpleasant. And so many people right now who are immigrants feel like, you know what?

I just better stay quiet, not get involved, not lead a political life. And that is not good for the United States.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Okay. Professor Arulanantham, let me just get some more clarity here. Because when we are speaking about the law, it can get somewhat opaque and definitely confusing. But now that we have that list of the 10 points or 10 areas in which the DOJ might want to seek denaturalization, just to check. If a U.S. citizen who is born in this country commits fraud against a private individual.

Or let's say engaged, allegedly engaged in fraud against the paycheck protection program or allegedly helped out a drug cartel. If a domestically born U.S. citizen committed any of those things, could they lose their citizenship?

ARULANANTHAM: No. No. Plain and simple, no.

CHAKRABARTI: And so that's the difference here. A difference, but go ahead.

ARULANANTHAM: I think and I'm sorry that lawyers are always trying to, being opaque but if a person is naturalized and after they're naturalized, they commit one of those same offenses that you're talking about, they cannot be stripped of their citizenship either.

And then that's why I think this memo is really trying to scare people by being ambiguous about that question. Now, if you commit a crime like that before you apply for citizenship, but it somehow doesn't come up in the interview or in your application and you fail to write that question, write that you were convicted on that basis, but you get naturalized anyway.

That mistake, that could be the basis, being denaturalized, but that mistake doesn't happen, right? Or must be extraordinary.

CHAKRABARTI: But what you're saying is that record the memo makes is quite fuzzy about whether they're talking about before or after someone becomes a U.S. citizen. So we're going to pick up on that thought when we come back.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Manta. Let me just ask you something about the limits of executive power in this case, because we talked, we've talked about multiple times. No, the president can't do this. President can't denaturalize more people just willy-nilly, or the expanded basis of denaturalization as determined by the Justice Department, not really practicable in an actual federal court, but I do wonder about that. Because aren't we talking about policies that are within the power of the executive to expand? As far as I know, the basis for denaturalization, beyond the you committed treason stuff.

It's not necessarily in the Constitution. I think that the Justice Department could in fact pursue more of these cases. Is that correct or no?

MANTA: The Department of Justice technically can do all sorts of things. Whether those things are legal and ethical is a different question. And same with whether the president directs them to do things that may or may not be legal and ethical.

So it's a matter of whether it's legitimate or not for them to do, and I don't think it is, and I think the courts will hopefully largely stop them. Now, who knows? They might also select carefully where they file their cases, which is another problem, right? If they look for specific judges that might have friendlier views toward this.

And you can game this a little bit more in some courts than others, what judge you get. But so it's not supposed to. Now, look we have precedents in history for when governments in the early 20th century used the power of denaturalization to basically go after certain, like, ethnic groups or go after people whose views it didn't agree with.

But then, the Supreme Court did push back ultimately against that. And then starting in the late '60s, this really slowed down. And it became much more just about, okay, was there fraud in the denaturalization process? And so part of that was the realization that the United States should not be like other countries that are totalitarian in nature.

And Soviet Union, et cetera, at the time, and that are more long, papers place type countries. And it's very frightening to see us now come back to that and basically unwind some of these things that have been recognized as no longer being acceptable.

So in that sense, it's a return to older history, except there is no legal precedent that should, to some extent, stand in the way of doing so.

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Arulanantham, would you like to add to that?

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah, I agree with what Professor Manta says. I think I would just add that currently the basis for denaturalization are written in federal laws that Congress has enacted. And the Supreme Court has construed those laws narrowly as we've both been saying pretty recently. The case I mentioned at the top of the show about the Bosnian Serb women who was not, she won in the Supreme Court. That was from 2017. And the prior case interpreting similar rules saying that you have to, the fraud has to be material. That is, it has to be something that would've caused you to lose, to not be eligible for naturalization. That was written by Justice Scalia.

So it could change. The Supreme Court has done all kinds of radical shifts in its doctrine in the recent past to conform to what the Trump administration wants to do. But this would be a very radical shift, and it would have to happen very fast in order for the legal system to accommodate some kind of mass denaturalization.

CHAKRABARTI: I'm thinking back to the fact that there have been so few cases in the past for a successful prosecution for denaturalization. And I wonder what happens to those people who are stripped of their citizenship? Where do they go if they're not dual citizens?

ARULANANTHAM: In the cases that I'm aware of, the government then seeks to deport the person.

And I'm aware of a handful of cases that came after, in the years after 9/11 when there were prosecuting in the sort of terrorism related context. And the ones I know about, people were sent back to countries that they had come from, many years ago, before they became U.S. citizens.

And those were criminal cases where the denaturalization was part of the criminal process because the person made a statement, like we talked about, had made a statement that was fraudulent and that would've rendered them ineligible for naturalization. So that's the ones that I'm aware of.

CHAKRABARTI: I don't know if Professor Manta, other information about what happens in those cases, but for me, from what I'm aware of, it leads to deportation.

MANTA: And some of them, the first step that happens is that people revert back to their previous status, which is normally a green card.

And so there still needs to be a process to actually do that deportation. And indeed, and in some cases, that's what happened. They just get sent back to usually wherever they came from originally. But some of them also stay here either because the government doesn't bother going after them or because they do it in such a way that fails.

For example, in the case of Baljinder Singh there was a drug offense committed during the time period that Singh was a citizen and before he was denaturalized, and the court there said, look, you can't deport him on the basis of that crime because he was not an alien at the time of that crime.

So this is just one example to show that it can actually get tricky to deport someone. Even once there has been an offense, you need another process. And that process may or may not work depending on whether you follow the statutory requirements accordingly. But I want to emphasize one point, which is that even though we're talking about a relatively small number of cases, this is really intended to scare people. And even a small number of cases can do that. And a couple of loud memos that say we're going to go after this whole laundry list of things. Again, some of these concepts being vaguer than others. And I think we can't get hung up on the fact that the number is small, even if the number, let's say, remains small next year, this is having an effect.

And if you speak with immigrants to the United States, you will see that they are changing the way that they live their lives and they express themselves out of fear.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Can, let's talk for another minute about the Singh case that you just brought up Professor Manta, because you said that before he was stripped of his denaturalization, he couldn't, obviously could not be, excuse me. Before he was stripped of his citizenship, he could not be deported, but he ended up getting denaturalized. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? Because I understand that this was also part of a first Trump administration effort called Operation Janus.

MANTA: Yeah, this was the first big Operation Janus case, so where the Trump administration digitized a bunch of records and to go after people that may have used the different names at different stages.

Singh's case is very, it's very strange in a sense, and very messy in a sense that there were two applications that he filed originally. To remain in the United States under two different names, but it's not obvious why. Because it's not like the first one was denied. It's just that something happened there procedurally where he may have not shown up at a hearing and so he files it again.

Ultimately Singh ends up getting citizenship in the United States, and he ends up getting denaturalized, as you said, because of this Operation Janus activity. And then after that, right after all that, it turns out that at some point he engaged in, it was like conspiracy to distribute MDMA and some other drugs, but during the period that he was a citizen.

And so Court of Appeals said in 2021, which is the last official record that I'm personally aware of. Alright, you can't do that. Like you can't get rid of him on that basis. And so the government probably thought that would be the easiest and then turned out to be wrong. And then, after that, like who knows what happened, whether they just give up or whether they're still at it. But this case was just one of these cases that stuck out because you had the denaturalization that was originally done in absentia. And there are a number of procedural problems with civil denaturalization as opposed to criminal denaturalization.

CHAKRABARTI: ... Yeah, I do wanna, actually, that's really very important. And I want to follow up on that, but I need to correct myself. Because I made an error in saying that Operation Janus was started in the first Trump administration. That is incorrect. I now have the proper date in front of me.

It was started in 2010, which would've been the Obama administration. And then it was launched, quote, to continue the work and expand the Department of Homeland Security efforts to identify individuals with a final deportation order who naturalized or obtained legal permanent resident status under a different identity. So it dates back 15 years now. But Professor Manta, I was going to ask both of you, and I'll just stick with you for a second. The difference between criminal denaturalization cases and civil ones, because the Department of Justice memo from this summer, I believe it focuses on civil denaturalization.

So talk about that.

MANTA: Yeah. So this is a very important distinction. Criminal denaturalization, while it sounds scarier, and in some sense, it is. Because you could also end up with actual criminal sanctions on top of being denaturalized, is something that is limited to the 10 years after you obtained naturalization.

So that's the statute of limitations. The government can only go after you during that time. And it also being a criminal proceeding comes with certain kinds of rights like a right to having a lawyer provided to you to a jury and so on, where civil denaturalization, and this is really one of the issues we're dealing with here.

It is endless. The government could show up dozens of years after somebody has become a citizen and say that person committed some kind of offense during their naturalization process. And we've decided we're going to go after them only now. And as my co-author, Cassandra Robertson and I have written about, there is a very strong interest in finality in the legal system generally, but specifically when it comes to naturalization.

Is there a point where we can say, you are now a citizen. You are now basically like everybody else. We don't have two classes of citizenship or not. And so you combine this door that was technically left open by maintaining this civil denaturalization process. With an administration that is potentially actively going after people that it doesn't like for ideological or racial or other reasons, and that becomes extremely dangerous and really divides America.

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Arulanantham, do you want to add to that?

ARULANANTHAM: Only that I think you could imagine a court that looked at that set of rules and said, we obviously should have a right to appointed counsel given how significant a deprivation it would be to take somebody's citizenship away. And similarly, a court that said it's not fair.

30, 40 years after the fact, it should be settled. There should be a statute of limitations in civil denaturalization proceedings. Unfortunately, I don't think this court is the one that you'd expect to make a ruling like that, but if we want a system of fair, orderly justice, I think those would be basic requirements that ought to be imposed.

CHAKRABARTI: Professor, you still there?

MANTA: Which one of us? (LAUGHS)

CHAKRABARTI: I've got multiple to choose from. I was trying to see if Ahilan is still there, but it looks like --

ARULANANTHAM: Yes, that's, I just wanted say, yeah, I think those are rules that ought to be in place.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Let me ask you both about one more thing, and that's the final the point number 10 in the DOJ memo, because it's the one that seems the broadest, that basically it's like we may pursue denaturalization against you at your 30, 40 years, even after you become a citizen.

If we just perceive you as being a threat or a potential danger to national security, I'm not sure how much broader you can be in terms of who could be targeted for denaturalization. And Ahilan, I'll just stick with you for a second and give Irina the last word there.

So it seems as if then, this could be a threat to people forever and essentially if indeed be the administration behaves this way, we will have a sort of two tier citizenship.

ARULANANTHAM: Yeah, I definitely think that's what the government intends in making this, in writing this.

But I think it's really important to be appropriately concerned, but also not to be overly concerned. And that's true of so many things in the Trump administration. And I think here the critical point is, this is a memo that is describing who they want to prioritize for denaturalization, like who do they wanna investigate? Who do they want to try to get at? But of course, the person still has to be subject to it. Like the law still has to require that they're not actually entitled to citizenship. If they go through every case of every person with a crime or maybe only certain nationalities, people with a crime, they can look and look.

But what they're gonna find if they go through thousands of those cases, is that only a vanishingly small number of them are actually subject to denaturalization. And so I think it's, like I said, it's important to be worried. I think a memo that creates prioritization like that to the threat of selective enforcement and targeting people for their political views is wrong, and that should be denounced.

But I don't think it's going to lead to thousands and thousands of denaturalizations. Because they can look all they want. They can look and look, but they're not gonna find very many people who are actually, the law would allow them to lose their citizenship.

“The European Convention on Human Rights provides the framework we need to address these issues effectively and responsibly.","At a Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg on Wednesday, justice ministers from the organisation's 46 member states defended the need to revamp the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for the modern age.

It came six months after nine countries – including Italy, Denmark, Poland and Belgium – published a letter criticising the ECHR for setting ""too many limits"" on their power to expel people from their territories.

The 46 nations will now work towards adopting a ""political declaration"" on the issue of migration at a summit next May.

Alain Berset, secretary-general of the Council of Europe, which oversees the convention, said signatory countries were not calling for the treaty itself to be rewritten.

""It was the start of a process, on a consensus basis, because it is the only way to make some progress,"" he told reporters after Wednesday's meeting.

Migration issues 'high on agenda'

The talks took place as Europe continues to tighten migration policy.

In early December, European Union member states agreed to make deportations easier and to expand the processing of asylum seekers outside Europe.

In recent years, the link between the European Convention on Human Rights and national measures to control migration has become the subject of intense political debate in many Council of Europe states.

“Migration issues are high on the agenda of countries and people across Europe,” said Berset ahead of the meeting.

“The European Convention on Human Rights provides the framework we need to address these issues effectively and responsibly. Our task is not to weaken the convention, but to keep it strong and relevant – to ensure that liberty and security, justice and responsibility, are held in balance.”

According to various sources cited by legal analysts, between 15 and 20 states now back the initiative launched by Denmark and Italy to narrow how parts of the convention are applied in migration cases.

Some governments have gone further. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has threatened to denounce the convention if a ruling expected in early 2026 on Polish pushbacks of migrants goes against his government.

EU pushes ahead with overhaul of migration rules as ‘return hubs’ approved

Push for reform

The debate centres on two key articles of the convention often used by those challenging deportation orders. Article 3 bans torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Article 8 protects the right to respect for private and family life.

Belgian jurist Marc Bossuyt, a former president of Belgium's constitutional court and a critic of the ECHR’s approach to migration, told French daily Le Monde that governments are “fed up with the interpretation of the Strasbourg court”.

He said he believes in these instruments and the rule of law, but argued that “international treaties established long ago must be applied in current circumstances”.

Bossuyt said the ECHR's reading of Article 3 goes too far by not only banning torture but also requiring states to provide a “decent asylum procedure” and “decent reception” for asylum seekers, which he argues falls outside the article.

He also called for a more restrictive reading of Article 8, warning that as long as the court in Strasbourg interprets it broadly, “it is normal that national judges follow it”.

In the UK, the debate has seen calls by the right-wing Conservative Party and anti-immigration Reform UK to quit the convention.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the left-wing Labour Party, has instead pushed for reform from within.

In a joint article with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, he argued that the convention should be updated to deal with “mass mobility” and said that “listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about”.

British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has already announced plans to curb the use of Article 8 in deportation appeals and to reassess how Article 3 is applied. She said the definition of these rights “has reached the heights of absurdity”.

“Today we try to deport criminals, but we find it is impossible because the prisons in their home countries have cells deemed too small, or even mental health services less effective than ours,” she said.

Under pressure? EU states on edge over migrant redistribution plan

Warnings from legal experts

Many legal scholars reject the claim that the court is blocking migration control. Strasbourg law professor Peggy Ducoulombier told Le Monde that in 10 years, immigration cases made up less than 2 percent of the court's 420,000 applications and that more than 90 percent were rejected as inadmissible or because there was no violation.

“One can disagree with a ruling, but this system protects all of us,” she said. “We have a lot to lose by weakening it.”

Céline Romainville, a law professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, said many attacks on the court “blow up one ruling without putting it in context” and do not take into account the full body of case law.

Officials at the Council of Europe and legal commentators say states are now working towards an interpretative declaration on migration and the convention, to be agreed by 2026, which would give political guidance to the court on how to apply the treaty.",https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/271d6cce-d5cc-11f0-9f7b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-66D79TK.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:59:55.484880

Bajun Mavalwalla II – a former army sergeant who survived a roadside bomb blast on a special operations mission in Afghanistan – was charged in July with “conspiracy to impede or injure officers” after joining an anti-ICE protest in Spokane, Washington.

Legal experts have said the case marks an escalation in the Trump administration’s attacks on first amendment rights. Veterans’ groups have decried the charges as “un-American”.

“My son is innocent,” said his father, Bajun Ray Mavalwalla, a retired US army intelligence officer with three Bronze stars earned during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The elder Mavalwalla said many of the people he meets in conservative eastern Washington state believe the government has over-reached. He launched an exploratory committee to challenge Spokane’s Republican representative Michael Baumgartner this fall after the Guardian featured his son’s arrest, drawing national attention to the case.

At the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, people say “‘Oh my God! This is an incredible injustice,’” Mavalwalla said. “‘Your son is a hero. He served his country. FBI agents should be out catching bank robbers and human traffickers. To use these agents to handcuff a veteran who was protesting is just ridiculous and a violation of constitutional rights … ‘”

The protest turned confrontational, leaving a government van’s windshield smashed and tires slashed, but Mavalwalla was not among the more than two dozen people arrested at the scene. More than a month passed before the FBI arrived at his door on 15 July.

Ben Stuckart, the former president of the Spokane city council, called for the protest, declaring in a Facebook post that he intended to physically block the transport of two Venezuelan immigrants who were in the country legally when they were arrested by ICE.

On Monday, Stuckart pleaded guilty to a felony conspiracy charge, avoiding the maximum sentence of six years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.

Instead, under an agreement reached with federal prosecutors, he was sentenced to 18 months supervised release with a promise to reduce the charges to a misdemeanor if there are no additional violations.

“Situations like this are happening all across the country,” Stuckart said of the arrest of the Venezuelan immigrants, who eventually opted to self-deport after sustained incarceration.

“At the time, it was my hope that the government would do the right thing and release them from custody. I understood what I was up against, but I felt it was necessary to take a stand. I accept full responsibility for my conduct,” he said.

Court records show prosecutors have now reached plea agreements with four of the nine individuals arrested for conspiracy after the demonstration in Spokane. Observers believe all but Mavawalla will strike deals to avoid prison. Representatives of the US attorney’s office in Spokane did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In continuing to contest the charges, Mavalwalla faces the same potential penalties Stuckart did: six years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release.

The indictments were handed down two days after career prosecutor Richard Barker, the acting US attorney for eastern Washington state, resigned. In a social post, Barker wrote: “I am grateful that I never had to sign an indictment or file a brief that I didn’t believe in.”

In August, Donald Trump nominated Pete Serrano, a former litigator for the Silent Majority Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, to head the office, while also installing him in an interim capacity. Serrano has no prosecutorial experience and has described the January 6 US Capitol rioters as “political prisoners”.

After pleading guilty to conspiracy, Stuckart invoked the memory of Martin Luther King, who was arrested 29 times, often in acts of civil disobedience.

King “explained that the antidote to fear is courage”, Stuckart said at sentencing: “We must be courageous, while accepting the consequences for our actions. And we must never stop fighting for each other.”

Clayborne Carson, a professor emeritus of history and director of the Martin Luther King Jr Papers Project at Stanford University, said that the FBI’s arrest of Mavalwalla and his co-defendants represented an escalation from the agency’s activities during the civil rights era.

“The FBI spied on Dr King. They spied on me,” he said. “There was even a file that said I had been ‘seen at the beach’.” But back then, Carson said, the FBI was seen as an ‘investigative agency’, not as one that would swoop in and put an activist in handcuffs.

“I cannot think of an instance where the FBI arrested Dr King for conspiracy,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff9b4a76638017d8072ccb96bde98c912d5c1921/143_0_1338_1070/master/1338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e11a36784e80212c20bcec42d9d8d224",N,,2025-12-11 10:57:10.921386

Units miss critical training that prepares them for combat, pilots and crews lose valuable flight hours, and dollars are spent on wasteful walls instead of family housing,” said Congressman Garamendi. “As this report shows, these disruptions come at a significant cost, in both dollars and readiness. In addition to costing the DoD up to three times more than it would cost DHS for the same operations, our military has to pay the bill. Diverting over $2 billion in funds siphons money away from training, modernization, and maintenance: core investments that should support military families and prepare our forces to fight and win.”

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts in support of DHS with money allocated for other DoD projects(link is external) including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) co-authored the report.

The members’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” said the members.

“The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” wrote the members. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border(link is external) instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was(link is external) “understaffed because roughly half its members [were] deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred(link is external) during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding(link is external) from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse(link is external) among service members and may have even contributed(link is external) to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

“The report also slammed the administration’s failure to adequately inform Congress and the public about the diversion of funds. “The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” said the members.",https://garamendi.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-11 10:56:47.516331

It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump's signature policy area, Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.

In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem’s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.

The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.

Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.

The secretary's appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador.

Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. Homeland Security says agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations do not target or arrest American citizens for immigration reasons although they say they have arrested Americans for allegedly interfering in enforcement operations.

And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

Also attending Thursday’s hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.

Previous hearings have included questions on cybersecurity, China, chemical security and drones. Under President Joe Biden, at times of heavy migration at the southern border, Republicans often focused their questioning on his Democratic administration's handling of border security.

When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b5d44d0e-7a38-4bda-9c11-013fcd34fc72/wirestory_3291f73f80c5619f70d439094393a3af_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:26.925036

Full Release

LOREAUVILLE, La., Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII (NYSE: HII) executives toured Breaux Brothers Enterprises in Loreauville, Louisiana, and announced that construction of a prototype of ROMULUS, the company’s new unmanned surface vessel (USV) family, has reached 30% completion. The vessel remains on schedule for sea trials in the fourth quarter of 2026.

During the visit, HII leaders toured the shipyard with build partners Breaux Brothers and Incat Crowther, and reviewed progress on hull construction, integration of the HII’s Odyssey Autonomous Control System (ACS), and outfitting work.

“ROMULUS is progressing at a pace that reflects the urgency of the mission and the strength of our partnerships,” said Andy Green, president of HII’s Mission Technologies division. “Breaux Brothers and our industry team are delivering a platform that brings scale, autonomy and real operational advantage to the fleet. At 30% complete, the ROMULUS prototype is well on its way to becoming the benchmark for unmanned surface capability.”

ROMULUS USVs are designed to meet the current and emerging requirements of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, joint forces and allies. They deliver high-endurance, sustained open-ocean autonomy with a focus on lethality, cost efficiency and scalability.

The family of USVs will support missions including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, counter-unmanned air systems, mine countermeasures, strike, and the launch and recovery of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

An image and video accompanying this release are available at: http://hii.com/news/hii-announces-major-milestone-for-romulus-usv-technology/ .

Paired with HII’s REMUS UUVs, ROMULUS extends undersea reach and supports a scalable dual-domain force package built for distributed maritime operations.

This ROMULUS prototype is the first in HII’s modular, AI-enabled ROMULUS USV line. The ships are engineered for rapid, repeatable production and high endurance at sea. With speeds over 25 knots and a range of 2,500 nautical miles, all ROMULUS USVs are designed for mission flexibility across global theaters.

ROMULUS is built around Odyssey ACS, HII’s proven autonomy suite used across more than 35 USV platforms and over 750 REMUS UUVs in 30 countries. Odyssey enables sustained open-ocean autonomy, multi-agent swarming, modular payload integration, and manned-unmanned teaming. ROMULUS platforms will also feature integrated capabilities from Shield AI, Applied Intuition, and C3 AI for enhanced autonomous performance and lifecycle sustainment.

The Odyssey software suite’s open-access, government-aligned architecture enables rapid integration of new sensors, payloads and third-party autonomy technologies. It allows industry, government and academia to test and refine capabilities, ensuring ROMULUS evolves in step with emerging naval concepts of operations.

In November, HII and Shield AI announced that they have successfully completed the first major test of their integrated autonomy solution aboard HII’s ROMULUS 20 USV, marking a key step toward operational deployment of the AI-enabled ROMULUS fleet.

ROMULUS is being developed with support from HII’s Dark Sea Labs Advanced Technology Group.

Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1050% increase in assaults against them and 8000% increase in death threats.
“I absolutely would characterize ICE as secret police, and it is absolutely imperative that we abolish ICE,” she told HuffPost.","There was a time when calling for the dismantling of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was considered too risky for a Democrat to campaign on.

But today, images of aggressive immigration arrests in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, have led to anti-ICE sentiment creeping back into the party’s messaging.

“Let me be clear: F--- ICE,” Patty Garcia, who is running for Congress in Illinois’ 4th Congressional District, said when she launched her bid. “It’s time to abolish ICE and hold Trump and his entire clan accountable.”

In Maine, Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner — in what’s shaping up to be one of the highest profile races in the nation — vowed to hold ICE agents responsible and “make them take their masks off” if Democrats gained power in the midterms.

“Organizations that are used to kidnap Americans are not organizations that should exist in the future,” Platner said at a town hall last month. “We need to have public hearings … frankly, probably trials down the road. Because the American people deserve to know what the hell is going on right now and how the people doing it can justify it to themselves.”

In New York, a 25-year-old survivor of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is making his first congressional bid on a platform that includes a call to abolish ICE.

“An organization that can be turned into the President’s fascist secret police in a matter of months cannot be reformed, only dismantled,” Cameron Kasky, a candidate for New York’s 12th Congressional District, states on his website.

All of the brazen talk by some Democrats comes as President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown increasingly draws political backlash at the ballot box, in polling and even among some in his own party. In most cases, Democrats have held back from calling for the outright abolition of ICE and instead are pushing for transparency, oversight or restricting local and state government cooperation with federal immigration officials.

There’s a difference today from how Democrats messaged the issue in 2018, when the “Abolish ICE” movement swept across the progressive end of the party. Many Democrats are now calling for an end to what they’ve coined “secret police,” saying they’re carrying out “kidnappings.” Most emphasize the need for a secure border and support deportations that target criminals, but they say today’s immigration efforts are shrouded in secrecy and lack accountability.

It represents a shift in how these Democrats plan to position themselves on one of the leading issues that swept Trump into office last year.

During Joe Biden’s presidency, public sentiment swung toward intensified border security and deportations after lax border enforcement led to an influx of migrant crossings. On the campaign trail last year, Trump portrayed his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris — whom Biden tasked with looking at the root causes of migration from Central America — as too soft on illegal immigration.

Trump’s relentless focus on immigration was cited in NBC exit polls as among the top issues among 2024 voters who supported him.

But since federal immigration agents have landed in cities across the country, public officials have sought ways to push back on Department of Homeland Security operations. The growing backlash is amplified by images of noncriminal undocumented immigrants being apprehended by masked federal agents, often aggressively. NBC News exit polling after the Nov. 4 elections showed Latino voters were concerned about Trump’s actions on immigration enforcement, with majorities of Latinos in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City saying the administration had gone too far. In New Jersey, municipalities that were at least 60% Latino that supported Trump or saw soft Democratic support in 2024 swung to Democrats by double digits.

While much of the rhetoric is targeted at ICE, the Border Patrol has taken a lead role in many of the deportation operations. Last month, immigration agents arrested a Chicago day care worker in front of students. In another instance, the targeting of an immigrant working on home construction in a residential neighborhood erupted into chaos, leading to a 2-year-old playing nearby to be exposed to tear gas.

“Everything has changed since Chicago. The images coming out of Chicago, the images coming out of Charlotte,” said Joe Calvello, senior adviser to Platner. “People across America I think are deeply disturbed by this. They view it as deeply un-American.”

“This is what Graham deeply believes, there needs to be accountability,” Calvello continued. “We need to unmask these people who are terrorizing not only our neighbors and community members, but American citizens.”

By contrast, Platner’s primary opponent in the Senate race, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, would not sign a bill prohibiting local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents.

In 2018, when Trump’s first administration faced fierce opposition for separating immigrant families, an anti-ICE movement emerged that many Democrats clung to nationally as a litmus test of sorts.

By 2020, however, as a crowded presidential primary was underway, some of their past statements involving the defunding of police or immigration agencies came back to haunt them. That included Harris, who had at one point in 2018 said that, with regard to ICE, “we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.” While Harris had also said that immigration agencies had a role to play, opponents often portrayed her as having moved too far to the left.

Calls for an outright elimination of ICE are still less common today than they were in 2018. At the same time, Democrats across the country are seeking ways through legislation and resolutions to strip the agency of some of its core functions or impose strict accountability measures. In September, California passed the No Secret Police Act and other legislation that bans ICE and other law enforcement from wearing masks or face coverings during enforcement and to display visible IDs. Similar efforts are underway in New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

A DHS official said it all comes at a cost, however.

“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences. Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1050% increase in assaults against them and 8000% increase in death threats. The men and women at ICE and CBP and all of our federal law enforcement agencies put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens to protect and defend the lives of American citizens. Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization,” Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement.

“Our law enforcement officers are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, we just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

DHS has often cited elevated threats against law enforcement but has not provided supporting data.

The 2018 anti-ICE movement was in part expanded after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used it as a central tenet in her stunning upset win over an entrenched New York Democratic congressman.

Since Trump took office in January, she’s reasserted that position, tangling with his administration to the point that his border czar, Tom Homan, threatened “maybe she’s gonna be in trouble.”

In May, she reiterated her support for ICE’s elimination and recently has held “know your rights” sessions in her district with immigrants who might be targeted for deportation. The White House seemed so certain that this was a losing issue, it posted a whole article on Ocasio-Cortez’s call for the elimination of ICE on its official web page.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., introduced legislation that would ban ICE from detaining or deporting U.S. citizens. A ProPublica investigation found more than 170 instances of citizens held by immigration officials. In an interview, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said he wants to use Congress’ purse strings to demand more oversight of DHS, which Republicans have infused with billions of dollars in additional funding.

Today, at least some Democrats feel they are on far safer ground as even the president’s allies are questioning administration tactics. Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., told NBC News that the recent off-year elections should be a “wake-up call for the GOP.” In those races, notably for the governors’ seats in New Jersey and Virginia, Republicans lost by wider margins than expected, and Hispanic Latino voters with whom Trump made record gains in 2024 swung back to Democrats.

In addition, roughly a half-dozen Republicans in Congress said the administration needed to rethink some aspects of its immigration crackdown, including the sweeping nature of Trump’s immigration push, according to a review of public statements by NBC News.

The administration needs “a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said in an October podcast interview, as she broke with the administration on the issue, expressing concerns about the effect of removing a portion of the workforce.

Other high-profile condemnations of the treatment of immigrants have grown louder, from country music star Zach Bryan to Pope Leo XIV. Most recently, the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, which has long supported immigration rights, took a rare step and for the first time in 13 years issued a special message denouncing the administration’s actions.

It is amid that backdrop that Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., called not just for ICE’s elimination, but argued from the House floor last week that DHS should be eliminated as an agency, perhaps shifting some functions elsewhere.

“We brought DHS into this world less than 25 years ago. We can build a world without it as well,” she said.

In an interview, Ramirez said that now, federal agents are acting without constraints and were unwilling to be accountable to anyone but Trump.

“The tides are turning and the American people are seeing ICE as one of the biggest threats to democracy itself,” Ramirez said. “It’s a contradiction to what this agency was created to be,” Ramirez said. “They are terrorizing communities across the city, and you’ve seen this across the country.”

In the race to succeed retiring Rep. Jan Schakowsky in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, top-polling contenders Kat Abughazaleh and Daniel Biss have both called for ICE to be abolished.

Abughazaleh wasn’t just a frequent presence in protests at an immigrant processing facility that became ground zero for pushback on the deportation efforts; she was indicted after she was accused of impeding a government vehicle from moving forward.

“I absolutely would characterize ICE as secret police, and it is absolutely imperative that we abolish ICE,” she told HuffPost.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat and a potential 2028 White House contender, has served as a national foil to Trump on the immigration issue, repeatedly holding up examples of overreach.

In an interview, Pritzker also said that some form of border patrol must always exist and that in past administrations, ICE had operated within its jurisdiction.

“We need secure borders,” he said. “You don’t have a country unless you have a secure border.”

Pritzker, though, focused on Trump’s role in steering ICE and CBP from having gone “way beyond the mission that they were founded for.”

“This president has essentially authorized them and provided them immunity for going after people who have committed what is, by law, a misdemeanor,” Pritzker said. “He’s essentially treating those people like they’re the worst of the worst, and they’re choosing to be cruel and to dehumanize people.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251125-chicago-immigration-arrests-mn-1400-d69128.jpg",N,,2025-12-11 09:58:32.238700

Mr. Trump has authorized covert action against Venezuela and has warned that the United States could “very soon” expand its attacks from boats off the Venezuelan coast to targets inside the country.
But Mr. Trump has also recently spoken by phone with Mr. Maduro about a possible meeting.","Neither proposal was expected to draw the 60 votes necessary to advance in the Senate, making it likely that the tax subsidies for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act will expire at the end of the month.

With Congress set to leave for the holidays next week and the two sides still far apart on their approach to rising health insurance costs, time was nearly out to renew the premium subsidies, causing a sharp increase in costs for millions of Americans who buy coverage on the federal health care exchange. The stalemate is likely to figure as a central issue in the upcoming midterm election campaigns as Democrats see an opening to pound Republicans for failing to head off premium increases and threatening health care access.

Republicans said that the Democratic approach would simply maintain a “bloated” federal program that was meant to be temporary and is experiencing unsustainable costs. They said a new Government Accountability Office investigation also found the program is susceptible to fraud that has contributed to insurance company profits.

“The Democrat proposal, which is a three-year extension of the status quo, is an attempt to disguise the real impact of Obamacare’s spiraling health care costs,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader. “If we extend this three years at a cost of $83 billion to the taxpayers, what happens after three years?”

Democrats said that the Republican proposal amounted to an inadequate “coupon” for health care, noting that it would only go to those who purchased high-deductible insurance plans that require people to pay thousands of dollars for medical care before receiving coverage. They argued it would do nothing to head off the immediate threat of rising premiums.

“What Republicans have put forward is a not a health care plan,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. “It is a sick joke.”

Republicans had committed to allowing Democrats a vote on their proposal to extend the health care subsidies as a condition of a deal to end the government shutdown. The G.O.P. had considered not offering an alternative to the Democratic proposal, but party leaders faced pressure to put a plan forward so Republicans could say they had some alternative to allowing the tax subsidies to expire.

House Republicans say that next week they would begin considering some piecemeal measures that represent their approach to addressing rising health care costs, but an extension of the subsidies are so far not part of the mix. As a result, a group of House Republicans worried about the political backlash from allowing the subsidies to expire started a petition on Wednesday to try to force a floor vote.

The White House has taken a largely hands-off approach to the congressional health care fight. President Trump initially suggested he would back a limited extension of the subsidies but was quickly urged by Republicans on Capitol Hill to drop that push.

The European leaders are among officials from about 30 countries supporting Ukraine, known as the “coalition of the willing,” that are scheduled to talk by videoconference on Thursday with President Volodymyr Zelensky. A flurry of recent diplomatic efforts have failed to produce any breakthrough in negotiations to end the war, which started nearly four years ago when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Mr. Trump, who has expressed growing impatience with Ukraine and its European allies, did not provide details about what “pretty strong words” had been used on the call. He also said that the European leaders wanted to meet this weekend with Mr. Zelensky and American officials but that “we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with.”

“We don’t want to be wasting time,” Mr. Trump said. “Sometimes you have to let people fight it out.”

The president added that Mr. Zelensky had to be “realistic,” although he did not elaborate.

As it tries to negotiate peace on more favorable terms, Ukraine is also trying to secure long-term guarantees intended to deter future Russian aggression and a framework for economic cooperation to rebuild the country after the war.

Mr. Zelensky held talks with American officials and business leaders on Wednesday to discuss those rebuilding efforts. Attendees included the U.S. treasury secretary, Scott Bessent; Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law who has been involved in negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to end the war; and Larry Fink, chief executive of the BlackRock investment firm, who has previously been tapped to help coordinate investment to rebuild Ukraine after the war.

In a video address after his talks with the American officials and Mr. Fink, Mr. Zelensky cautioned that reconstruction would become possible only once the country was secure.

“When there is security,” he said, “everything else follows.”

Ukraine faces an increasingly tough battlefield as Russia tries to strengthen its position in negotiations by mounting offensives along the entire front line, with especially heavy fighting reported in the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

The Kremlin has insisted that Ukraine cede all of the eastern region of the country, known as the Donbas, a demand that Mr. Zelensky has rejected.

Russian forces are close to capturing Pokrovsk, a strategically important city in eastern Ukraine where the two sides have been fighting since July 2024. The city is largely under Russian control, though Ukrainian forces still hold parts of it.

A Ukrainian army corps responsible for operations in the area said in a social media post on Wednesday that Russian troops had begun an assault that morning under cover of rain and fog, trying to break into the city’s northern section with armored vehicles, cars and motorcycles. The Ukrainian military also released videos showing retaliatory drone strikes against Russian vehicles.

Overnight on Wednesday, Russia also targeted Ukraine infrastructure with 151 drones and three ballistic missiles, according to the Ukrainian authorities — the latest in a series of Russian bombardments that aim to harm the country’s energy grid. Ukraine also carried out overnight drone strikes on Russia.

In recent months, the federal government has mobilized the National Guard and deployed federal agents to several U.S. cities, primarily Democratic-led areas with large immigrant populations, against the wishes of local leaders. Trump administration officials have said those efforts were necessary to enforce immigration laws and reduce crime. But the operations have sometimes led to clashes between federal agents and residents who have criticized their use of force.

Federal officials have defended their use of tear gas and other crowd-control munitions against protesters in cities like Chicago, saying they had limited the measures to instances in which there was an immediate threat to agents.

The Department of Homeland Security has also made changes to the legal immigration system since last month’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., which left one dead. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan who received asylum in April, has been charged in the attack. Mr. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

Since then, the Trump administration has halted the ability of Afghans to obtain visas, paused decisions on asylum applications and vowed to review the more than 50,000 asylum applications that were approved during the Biden administration. It has also paused immigration applications submitted by foreign nationals from the 19 countries subject to the president’s travel ban.

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security have also said they would re-examine applications that were approved for migrants from those countries who entered the United States since the beginning of the Biden administration.

Those changes have already disrupted some immigrants’ applications for benefits. In recent days, immigration lawyers have said their clients have had their green card interviews or naturalization ceremonies canceled with little explanation.

In October, the administration significantly cut the number of refugees who are accepted and said it would give priority to mostly white Afrikaner South Africans. The Trump administration lowered the ceiling for refugee admissions to 7,500 for this fiscal year, down from the 125,000 cap the Biden administration set last year.

The measure includes an array of provisions that place Mr. Trump’s stamp on the U.S. military, including one that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the Defense Department. But to bring it up, House Republicans had to overcome resistance in their own ranks from hard-right members, some of whom said the measure, which seeks to block U.S. troops from withdrawing from Europe and would send new aid to Ukraine, abandoned the president’s “America First” promises.

The legislation also reflected growing frustration among members of both parties with the way Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has run the Pentagon, especially when it comes to the administration’s boat strikes in international waters, which have killed at least 87 people since September.

It would mandate that the Defense Department send Congress unedited videos that officials have so far been unwilling to show lawmakers of the maritime attacks, which Mr. Trump has said are being undertaken to target narco-terrorists trafficking drugs into the United States. And it would withhold 25 percent of Mr. Hegseth’s travel budget if he failed to give the congressional national security committees the video footage and the command orders behind the strikes.

The price tag for the bill came in $8 billion above what the Trump administration had requested, reflecting continued support in Congress for pouring huge sums into the military.

Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees said the bill would modernize and streamline the way the military buys weapons and supplies. White House officials argued in a statement that it would “strengthen the defense industrial base while eliminating funding for wasteful and radical programs.”

But the legislation also challenged parts of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

The bill would block the Pentagon from reducing the number of troops “permanently stationed in or deployed” to Europe below 76,000 for longer than 45 days, unless Mr. Hegseth and the top officer overseeing U.S. European Command certify to Congress that such a drawdown aligns with U.S. national security interests and that NATO allies were consulted.

And though Mr. Trump has pressed to end U.S. military support to Ukraine, the measure would authorize $400 million in annual security assistance for Kyiv for another two years. A handful of House Republicans, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, cited that provision in explaining their opposition to the bill.

“I would love to fund our military but refuse to support foreign aid and foreign militaries and foreign wars,” Ms. Greene wrote on social media.

Limiting the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe is at odds with recent moves by the Pentagon, which recently said it would cut U.S. troops in Germany, Romania and Poland, taking lawmakers by surprise. The provision also challenges the approach laid out in a new White House national security strategy that threatens to back European political parties “cultivating resistance” over longstanding U.S. allies in NATO countries.

Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a speech on the House floor that voting for the bill was an act of reasserting Congress’s authority as a coequal branch of government, “which is but one step along a very long road.” The legislation, he added, was an effort “to try to get some restraint on the lack of transparency, the unaccountability and the problems that are coming out of this White House and this Department of Defense.”

Democrats had pushed to include a change to the Defense Department’s health care plan to cover in vitro fertilization for troops and their family members. But for the second year in a row, Speaker Mike Johnson intervened during final negotiations to kill that provision. His opposition sprang from concerns that I.V.F. would lead to the destruction of embryos, a central critique of the treatment by conservatives.

The bill would also repeal Iraq and Persian Gulf War-era authorizations for the use of military force that presidents of both parties have used to justify military operations overseas without the consent of Congress, something Democrats and Republicans have long called for.

And it would roll back sweeping sanctions imposed on Syria’s construction, energy and financial sectors when former president Bashar al-Assad was in power. In the aftermath of the Assad regime and more than a decade of civil war in Syria, lawmakers in both parties have pressed to repeal the penalties to spur economic development there.

The House originally passed a bill loaded with conservative social policy mandates, including a ban on the Pentagon covering gender-affirming surgeries for troops. But that provision and several others were stripped out in final negotiations. The legislation still includes a ban on transgender women participating in women’s athletic programs at U.S. military academies.

Some aspects of the measure agreed upon during final talks were drawing harsh criticism on Wednesday, including one that originated in the House that would weaken safety measures around Ronald Reagan National Airport outside of Washington.

The bill would create a waiver to allow military aircraft to turn off enhanced tracking software while flying on national security missions through parts of the Washington airspace, or if the military determines that the flight poses no risk to commercial planes.

The legislation “fails to make the skies safer,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel’s top Democrat, said in a joint statement.

House Democrats also took issue with what they said was a last-minute addition to the bill that would expand the ability of federal agencies, and potentially local law enforcement, to monitor, intercept and disable drones that could pose a threat.

Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said the provision lacked “necessary guardrails,” and warned that it could “lead to major civil liberties violations.”

When asked about the ship’s oil, Mr. Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.” He declined to say who owned the tanker. “It was seized for a very good reason,” he added.

Three U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law enforcement operation, said the ship was carrying Venezuelan oil. They said there was no resistance from the crew and no casualties.

In a statement, Venezuela’s government called the seizure a “barefaced robbery and an act of international piracy” aimed at stripping the country of its oil wealth.

The operation was the latest tactic in an expanding effort to squeeze Venezuela and pressure Mr. Maduro. The Trump administration has accused him of running a “narcoterrorist” cartel sending drugs to the United States, although many current and former officials in Washington say the campaign is ultimately aimed at regime change.

Since September, the United States has launched more than 22 known strikes against boats in the region, killing more than 80 people. The Trump administration insists, without publicly providing evidence, that the boats are smuggling drugs. Legal experts say the strikes may violate international law.

Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a video on Wednesday evening on social media showing armed U.S. forces rappelling from a helicopter onto the deck of the tanker. The video could not be independently verified.

Ms. Bondi said the operation included the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard, supported by the Pentagon. She said the tanker had been used to transport “sanctioned oil” from Venezuela and Iran.

The U.S. officials said they expected additional seizures in the coming weeks as part of the administration’s efforts to weaken Mr. Maduro’s government by undermining its oil market.

One of the officials identified the tanker as a vessel called the Skipper, and said it was carrying Venezuelan oil from Petróleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company known as PDVSA. The official said the ship had been previously linked to the smuggling of Iranian oil — a global black market that the Justice Department has been investigating for years. The vessel was sailing under the flag of another Latin American nation in which it was not registered, the official said, and its ultimate destination was Asia.

A federal judge issued a seizure warrant roughly two weeks ago because of the ship’s past activities smuggling Iranian oil, not because of links to the Maduro government, the official said. Prosecutors have said that Iran uses money generated from oil sales to finance its military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the United States has designated a terrorist entity.

The administration did not address many details about the operation, including what happened to the crew and what ultimately will happen to the ship. It was not clear whether the seizure warrant — which is sealed — was for the ship or the oil or both. The White House did not immediately respond when asked whether the United States had the legal authority to keep the oil.

The ship, under a different name, had been put under sanctions by the Treasury Department in 2022. U.S. officials said it was part of “an international oil smuggling network that facilitated oil trades and generated revenue” to support Hezbollah and Iran’s revolutionary guard force.

The tanker may have been trying to conceal its whereabouts by broadcasting falsified location data before the seizure, according to an analysis of satellite imagery and photographs by The New York Times.

The Navy, the Coast Guard, Southern Command and the Pentagon all declined to discuss the episode, referring questions to the White House.

Venezuela is exceptionally dependent on oil, which makes these kinds of seizures potentially damaging to the country’s fragile economy. Oil accounts for the bulk of the country’s export revenues. In turn, Venezuela’s government spends much of the proceeds from oil exports to import basic necessities like food and medicine.

Although Venezuela is believed to have colossal untapped oil reserves, the country produces far less oil than it did at the start of the century, after mismanagement, U.S. sanctions and corruption at PDVSA hobbled output.

The United States was long the largest buyer of Venezuela’s oil, but political tensions have eroded those ties. China now buys roughly 80 percent of Venezuela’s overall oil exports.

Smaller amounts of Venezuelan oil are exported to the United States, often to refineries on the Gulf Coast, and to Cuba, where the island nation’s Communist leaders have long relied on such cargoes to provide a semblance of economic stability.

In recent months, Mr. Trump has ordered a huge buildup of U.S. forces in the region, with more than 15,000 troops and a dozen ships in the Caribbean, including the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Trump has authorized covert action against Venezuela and has warned that the United States could “very soon” expand its attacks from boats off the Venezuelan coast to targets inside the country. But Mr. Trump has also recently spoken by phone with Mr. Maduro about a possible meeting. The president said on Wednesday that he had not spoken to Mr. Maduro since their last conversation.

The administration has developed a range of options for military action in the country, including targeting Mr. Maduro and seizing control of the country’s oil fields. The president has repeatedly expressed reservations about an operation to remove Mr. Maduro from power, aides say, in part because of a fear that the operation could fail. Mr. Trump has been in no rush to make a decision, though he has shown a particular interest in extracting some of the value of Venezuela’s oil for the United States.

The oil tanker operation came on the same day the Nobel Peace Prize was formally bestowed on a Venezuelan dissident, María Corina Machado. She was not at the ceremony on Wednesday in Oslo, where her daughter received the prize on her behalf, but the Nobel Peace Prize committee said she had left Venezuela and was traveling to Oslo.

The Council of Europe met to discuss the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and migration, with its 46 member states backing plans to tackle concerns over addressing migration within the existing legal framework.

Law Society of England and Wales president, Mark Evans, said: “A fair society is one that protects us all and gives us the tools we need to enforce these protections. We all benefit when we can uphold the interests of everyone in our community and challenge government decisions that directly affect our lives.

“The ECHR is a vital part of these protections. It protects everyday rights, such as living our lives freely without unwarranted government interference or having public services that act for our common good. These rights have served us time and again.

“In times of global instability, our membership of the ECHR shows that we are a country that respects and upholds our international obligations, as well as the fundamental protections – protections we helped to define – that are set out in the Convention.

“The ECHR and the Council of Europe provide a foundation of shared values which enable us to work with other countries to navigate modern global challenges. Inter-state collaboration is vital to addressing these issues.

“We can address concerns about border controls without stripping people of their rights under ECHR. The Law Society strongly rejects calls to leave the ECHR.

Prairie Band LLC, the tribe’s company, had landed a contract to assist in the design of detention centers for ICE.

The Kansas-based tribe announced the leadership changes Tuesday evening, just hours after the company’s president defended the decision to take the contract.

The tribe said the project does not align with its values.

“As a sovereign Nation, our values guide the decision we make,” the tribe said in the Facebook announcement, “and we acknowledge that this contract does not align with those principles.”

The tribe said it will reevaluate its internal review and approval process for taking on federal contracts. It also plans for all future agreements to “align clearly with our values and mission.”

However, it’s unclear the tribe will cancel the project. The announcement did not mention plans to nix the deal and officials for the tribe did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

“We recognize the weight this news carries for so many, as well as the feelings of anger, confusion and disappointment it caused,” the tribe said in the Facebook statement.

Jacob Wamego, Prairie Band LLC president, initially defended the contract, noting the company’s work mostly comes from federal contracts.

He told the Topeka Capital-Journal that the company would help with facility designs, but that he did not know where the facilities would be located.

The contract comes amid President Donald Trump’s campaign to remove people in the U.S. without full legal status. That effort has been hampered by a lack of detention space for tens of thousands of people facing possible deportation.

The federal government currently lists two immigration detention centers in Kansas — the Chase County Jail and the federal prison in Leavenworth.

Private prison company CoreCivic is attempting to reopen its facility in Leavenworth to house immigration detainees. But those plans have been delayed because of a legal dispute between the company and Leavenworth city leaders.

Why the census citizenship question matters The first Trump administration fell short in its push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
Aside from apportionment and redistricting, census data helps inform how trillions of dollars in funding are allocated to states to improve health, housing, education, and other community services.
That’s especially true in “mixed-status households” — families with U.S. citizens and noncitizens, including legal permanent residents and undocumented immigrants, under one roof.

The impacts of the latest fight over Texas’ political maps are still reverberating around the state, but there are other debates on the horizon.

Future political representation could hinge on President Donald Trump’s renewed push to exclude at least some noncitizens from the population counts that help determine how political power is distributed in the U.S.

In Texas, where Republicans pushed through a rare midcycle redistricting this year to try to maintain their advantage in Congress after the 2026 midterm elections, experts say that excluding noncitizens when drawing districts could open another way for the GOP to tighten its grip on the state Legislature and congressional delegation.

In addition, many experts and critics worry it could ultimately place some Texas communities into larger, less cohesive districts, while diluting the political influence of Latinos and other minority groups who have accounted for much of the state’s population gain in recent decades. Adding questions about citizenship to the U.S. census could also lead to more undercounting of Latinos, they warn, a problem that has plagued previous censuses.

The various proposals raise substantial undecided legal and constitutional questions that would have to be settled in court, making the outcomes of such changes impossible to precisely predict. But to understand the possibilities if some or any of these proposals go forward, it’s helpful to separate them into three categories: changes to the census; changes to the apportionment of House seats and electoral votes among states; and changes to the drawing of congressional and state legislative districts, which happens at the state level.

How we count people — and which people count

Any effort to reanchor the distribution of political power around citizenship starts with the decennial census. Republicans and conservative groups are lining up behind a continuing effort to add a citizenship question to the questionnaire, a plan that ran into legal hurdles during the first Trump administration.

Under the Constitution, the decennial census — “counting the whole number of persons in each State” every 10 years — determines how many congressional representatives and electoral votes each state gets. As courts have interpreted this clause in the past, it means everyone is counted, regardless of their age, immigration or citizenship status, or eligibility to vote.

Trump has pushed this year for a new, mid-decade census that would not count immigrants without legal status. But the census has a long lead time. The Census Bureau says it’s been preparing for the 2030 census since 2019 and is planning to conduct a major on-the-ground test for it in 2026. The commerce secretary must submit census questions to Congress two years before the actual census takes place.

There are also several Republican-supported bills that would affect the census’s counting of noncitizens. They differ, but they generally call for using only the number of U.S. citizens, rather than the total population, to calculate how to apportion House seats and electoral votes among the states. Four Republican-led states earlier this year also sued the federal government, arguing that undocumented immigrants and immigrants with temporary visas shouldn’t be included, though that case has been stayed for now.

Some Republicans who support the proposals argue that including noncitizens creates imbalances in citizens’ voting power depending on where they live — rewarding jurisdictions that welcome undocumented immigrants. “Today, a voter in a congressional district with 730,000 citizens … and 30,000 illegal aliens has a stronger say in the election of his representative than a voter in a congressional district with 760,000 citizens and no illegal immigrants,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, said during a congressional committee hearing on the census in November.

Democrats, meanwhile, said the proposals would be unconstitutional and would hurt vulnerable populations.

“Alexander Hamilton is on record saying during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, ‘There can be no truer principle than this: that every individual of the community at large has an equal right to the protection of the government,’” said U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat. “Ultimately, the census is a national snapshot we take every 10 years that helps us understand and define who we are, how to govern, and undermining that process in ways that distort that picture will harm all of us.”

If all or some noncitizens were to be excluded from the census, states estimated to have large populations of noncitizens — a red and blue mix that includes Texas, California, New Jersey, Florida, and New York — could lose House seats and electoral votes, or gain fewer than they would have.

But multiple legal experts, including Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and professor at Loyola Law School who advised President Joe Biden’s administration on democracy and voting rights, and Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University’s College of Law and an expert on election and constitutional law and voting rights, say excluding all or some noncitizens from apportionment counts would be unconstitutional, given the clear language on apportionment in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. It would quickly draw legal challenges, and they don’t believe courts would allow it, they said.

But if the Trump administration adds a census question on citizenship, which wouldn’t in itself change the apportionment counts, that would generate the key data state officials would need to draw their internal U.S. House and state legislative district lines based on the population of citizens.

In a 2016 case over state-level redistricting in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court left open the question of whether states could use criteria other than total population, such as the population of eligible voters — roughly speaking, citizens age 18 or above — for the state-level task of drawing district maps. Texas, according to the court’s ruling in Evenwel v. Abbott, had argued that “jurisdictions may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, design districts using any population baseline—including total population and voter-eligible population—so long as the choice is rational and not invidiously discriminatory.”

Experts disagree, however, on whether the Supreme Court has left the question open for both congressional districts and state legislative districts or just for state legislative districts. Morley, for example, said the former, while Levitt believes the latter.

During the failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, evidence emerged showing a longtime political strategist had drawn up a case study showing that using the population of voting-age citizens rather than total population to draw Texas state House districts would advantage Republicans and non-Hispanic white Texans. That’s a big reason why some experts and advocates are concerned about the implications for communities of color.

If Texas draws districts to have equal populations of adult citizens rather than equal total populations, some districts would have to grow geographically to include enough adult citizens — creating districts that are larger geographically and by total population. The effects of using citizen voting-age population would likely be most pronounced in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and in the Rio Grande Valley, according to experts and an analysis by the Electoral Innovation Lab done earlier this year for Votebeat.

The effect will “tend to be to shift power away from urban areas that have larger numbers of noncitizens,” Morley said.

In these districts, U.S. citizens would see an impact as well. Individuals would have less representation if everyone isn’t counted, said Jonathan Cervas, a redistricting expert, assistant teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and collaborator with the Electoral Innovation Lab.

“That’s the real-world consequence” of redistricting based on citizen-only population counts in those areas, he said. Actual citizens “end up worse off.”

Let’s look at an example: The Rio Grande Valley

The Rio Grande Valley is one of the areas where new political boundaries based on citizenship voting-age population could have a profound effect, according to the analysis by Cervas, Neil Dixit, and Sam Wang of the Electoral Innovation Lab, as well as other redistricting experts.

Near the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border, neighboring Hidalgo and Cameron counties are home to more than 1 million people combined. The area has a diverse population that works in manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, retail, and food service industries.

Both counties also have multiple ports of entry between Mexico and the U.S., overwhelmingly Latino populations, and many mixed-status households.

The area is also home to more than 1,000 colonias — unincorporated rural communities that often lack access to basic services and infrastructure — housing anywhere from two dozen to over a thousand each.

The area is part of the Democratic-leaning 34th Congressional District, which, as it stands now, includes eastern Hidalgo County and all of Cameron, Kenedy, Kleberg, and Willacy counties. (The map state lawmakers passed this summer takes the Hidalgo County part of the district out and instead adds part of Nueces County.)

If the district had to be redrawn based on its citizen voting-age population, it would almost certainly need to grow geographically, according to an analysis by Cervas, because otherwise there wouldn’t be enough citizens in it to keep it equal to other districts.

Lupita Sanchez, a resident of Brownsville in Cameron County and executive director of Border Workers United, a nonpartisan immigrant advocacy nonprofit, said redistricting should be fair. “Everyone should be counted because everyone contributes to this nation in different ways,” she said.

Why the census citizenship question matters

The first Trump administration fell short in its push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the administration’s stated reasons for wanting to add the question were contrived — but it didn’t preclude asking it on a future census.

Aside from apportionment and redistricting, census data helps inform how trillions of dollars in funding are allocated to states to improve health, housing, education, and other community services. It helps businesses plan investments and local governments decide how to allocate resources, such as services for the elderly and where to build new roads, schools, or job training centers. So the developers of the census questionnaire strive to tread lightly with any change that might diminish response rates or compromise the completeness of the data they collect.

Census questionnaires are distributed to individual addresses and capture answers about everyone in the household. Even though the answers are not released to the public and are used only to generate statistics, experts have long said that adding a citizenship question would make some people, especially immigrants, less likely to respond to the census, resulting in less accurate data and further diminishing the political influence of some communities.

The Republican push to add a citizenship question “is designed to deepen the distrust and therefore trigger an even higher undercount, specifically of the Latino community,” said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which opposed the first Trump administration’s 2020 effort.

“Mistrust runs deep,” said Victoria Fajardo, a resident of Hidalgo County in the Rio Grande Valley and a community advocate with the immigrant and social services advocacy group La Union del Pueblo Entero (LUPE). That’s especially true in “mixed-status households” — families with U.S. citizens and noncitizens, including legal permanent residents and undocumented immigrants, under one roof. Around 8% of Texas households include an undocumented immigrant, according to Pew Research Center estimates from 2022.

People fear their personal information could be shared with government agencies for enforcement reasons, Fajardo said. Adding a citizenship question to the census “would just further the undercounting of the community. Especially under this administration,” she said, “where it feels like surveillance of immigrants is heightened.”

The census has already undercounted the population in parts of the Rio Grande Valley in the past, advocates say.

Prominent Texas officials supported Trump’s effort to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census, and Texas also joined a multistate brief filed with the Supreme Court in favor of the Trump administration’s position. In 2019, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the idea that it would lead to an undercount was “nothing other than conjecture.”

How redistricting is supposed to work

Each state’s political maps must be redrawn once per decade, after each census, to account for population growth and ensure that every congressional or legislative district has virtually the same number of people. Mid-decade redistricting, like the one Texas pushed through this year, is legal but unusual — although Trump’s push to add red seats in some states has set off a chain reaction of it this year.

In Texas and most other states, redistricting is the purview of the state legislature and governor, and if one party controls both, it can draw the boundaries for both congressional districts and state legislative districts as it sees fit. Within certain limits, state lawmakers can effectively decide which voters they want in each district, based on political or partisan objectives. The practice goes back centuries, but modern data tools have made it easier to precisely draw boundaries that include or exclude certain voters and maximize partisan advantage.

In other states, it’s up to a bipartisan or independent commission to oversee redistricting.

There are a few rules and principles that apply in all states. For example, a given state’s districts must have virtually equal populations. All states must comply with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, which means they can’t discriminate on the basis of race — though a U.S. Supreme Court decision is pending in a case out of Louisiana that could drastically change how the Voting Rights Act applies to redistricting.

There are also widely applied redistricting principles that call for districts to be, among other things, compact and contiguous and to preserve communities of interest and follow other lines, such as city boundaries, whenever possible. And several states have specific requirements of their own: In Texas, for example, lawmakers must also comply with the state constitution’s requirements when it comes to splitting counties between state House districts.

Courts have found Texas’ congressional maps to be racially gerrymandered in every decade from the 1970s to the 2010s.

The maps that Texas Republicans drew after the 2020 census were under challenge in court when lawmakers decided to redraw the state’s congressional map this summer, though judges had yet to rule. The new map was promptly challenged in court as well, and in November, a panel of federal judges struck down the map as a racial gerrymander. However, their decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled Dec. 4 that Texas could use its new congressional map while the high court considers the merits of the case. That makes it likely that the congressional map lawmakers passed this summer will be used in the 2026 election.

The Trump administration has drawn links between the surge in immigration during the administration of former President Joe Biden and road safety concerns.","The Trump administration said Wednesday that it has pulled nearly 10,000 commercial truck drivers off U.S. roadways for failing to speak English sufficiently.

The boast comes as trucking companies have raised alarms about drivers being targeted by President Donald Trump's immigration agenda.

""We've now knocked 9,500 truck drivers out of service for failing to speak our national language — ENGLISH!"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an X post.

""This administration will always put you and your family's safety first,"" Duffy said.

Duffy was responding to a report by Bloomberg that detailed fallout in the trucking industry from a new language policy and other rules.

The industry – which was already grappling with declining freight volumes and rising overheads – is bracing for a significant drop in the supply of drivers because of the federal government's enforcement actions, Bloomberg reported.

Trump signed an executive order in early March designating English as the country's official language.

In April, the president signed another order directing Duffy to ensure that commercial truck drivers who fail to meet English proficiency requirements are taken out of service.

That order rescinded an Obama-era policy, which the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration says directed personnel to issue citations to commercial drivers who violate English standards, but not remove them from service.

The strengthened enforcement policy went into effect in late June.

Texas and Wyoming have seen the largest number of drivers out of the more than 9,500 who have been pulled from the road, Bloomberg reported.

The Trump administration has drawn links between the surge in immigration during the administration of former President Joe Biden and road safety concerns.

Duffy, in late June, announced a nationwide audit of states' practices regarding issuing ""non-domiciled"" commercial driver's licenses, with a particular focus on the ""potential for unqualified individuals obtaining licenses and posing a hazard on our roads.""

""The open borders policies of the last administration allowed millions to flood our country – leading to serious allegations that the trucking licensing system is being exploited,"" Duffy said at the time.

The administration has pointed to the criminal case of Harjinder Singh, a commercial truck driver charged in August with causing a deadly crash on a Florida turnpike, as an example of the trucking industry becoming a ""lawless frontier.""

The Transportation Department issued emergency rules after the crash, limiting the issuance of commercial licenses to non-U.S. citizens.

In October, Duffy's department said it would withhold over $40 million from California after finding the state had not complied with the English proficiency standards.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108216750-17613309902025-10-24t174840z_1178496511_rc2gihaada2o_rtrmadp_0_usa-shutdown-travel.jpeg?v=1761331010&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:40.758583

called on the Warner Bros. board to recognize the consequences of selling the company, which includes news organization CNN, to billionaire foreign rulers.","Congressional Democrats are sounding alarms over the deep involvement of Saudi Arabian and other Middle Eastern royal families in Paramount’s proposed bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.

Warner Bros. Discovery owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film and television studios in Burbank behind such beloved American classics as “Casablanca,” “Citizen Kane” and Bugs Bunny, and blockbuster hits including “Harry Potter,” “Dirty Harry,” “The Matrix” and “Friends.”

Late last week, Paramount, which is controlled by billionaire Larry Ellison’s family, came up short in the bidding for Warner Bros., in part over the Warner board’s concerns about the financing of the deal. On Monday, Paramount launched a hostile takeover of Warner Bros., appealing directly to Warner shareholders — asking them to sell their stock to Paramount for $30 a share.

On Wednesday, Paramount sent a letter to Warner shareholders asking that they tender their shares, which would allow Paramount to acquire the company through its hostile takeover.

In the letter to Warner shareholders, Ellison’s son, David, who is Paramount’s chairman, wrote: “Our public offer ... delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix.”

It added that Paramount’s offer would be “financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.”

It did not disclose that the sovereign wealth funds were the majority of the new equity. Paramount’s gambit has thrown the auction, and the Warner board’s selection of Netflix’s $72-billion deal, into doubt.

Paramount has long insisted that it represents the best partner for Warner Bros., in part because of the Ellison family’s cozy relations with President Trump. The company has trumpeted its ability to gain the blessing of the Trump administration for its proposed deal.

Paramount’s bid is heavily backed by the sovereign funds of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The three royal families have agreed to contribute $24 billion — twice the amount the Larry Ellison family has said it would provide in financing for Paramount’s proposed $78-billion takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to regulatory filings.

Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, would also have an ownership stake.

On Wednesday, U.S. Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-San José) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) called on the Warner Bros. board to recognize the consequences of selling the company, which includes news organization CNN, to billionaire foreign rulers.

“This transaction raises national security concerns because it could transfer substantial influence over one of the largest American media companies to foreign-backed financiers,” Liccardo and Pressley wrote in a Wednesday letter to Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav.

“Warner’s platforms reach tens of millions of American households through HBO, Max, CNN, Warner Bros. Pictures, Discovery, and numerous digital and cable properties,” the lawmakers wrote. “They also shape the news, entertainment, and cultural content consumed by the American public.”

The concerns adds a new wrinkle to the Warner Bros. auction, which already had political overtones. Trump has said he planned to be involved in the decision-making, and he’s offered praise for both Larry and David Ellison and Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos, who has visited with the president leading up to last week’s auction deadline.

Transactions involving “foreign investors with governance rights, access to non-public data, or indirect influence over content distribution [create] vulnerabilities that foreign governments could exploit,” the lawmakers wrote. They asked the Warner board, should it opt for Paramount, to agree to a federal review of the transaction to determine whether the involvement of the Middle Eastern investors would pose a national security risk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would lead any such review.

Paramount, in its regulatory filings, said the three Middle Eastern royal families had agreed to give up voting rights and a role in the company’s decision-making — despite contributing more than half the equity needed for the deal.

Paramount has said it would not be required to submit the proposed Warner transaction to the federal Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S., or CFIUS, because the sovereign wealth funds have waived their governance rights, should the Ellison family prevail in the bidding for Warner Bros.

“Paramount might not need CFIUS but the American people do,” Liccardo said in an interview with The Times. “We need to ask ourselves: What is of value that would command a $24-billion investment from three royal families?”

Traditional film and TV production companies are part of “an industry that is struggling mightily,” Liccardo said. “So if you look at an acquisition like this ... if not for the going concern, what particular assets are of value? Consider the sensitive personal data of tens of millions of Americans, and ask how valuable that data might be?”

Representatives of Warner Bros. and Paramount declined to comment.

The Ellison family acquired Paramount in August. David Ellison, the chief executive, attended a White House dinner last month in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The involvement of Mohammed and his Saudi Public Investment Fund was concerning to the two lawmakers.

“The fund is controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom (according to the declassified 2021 report of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence) ordered the murder of U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi,” the lawmakers wrote.

They noted that Kushner’s Affinity Partners was also backed by a $2-billion investment from the Saudi Public Investment Fund. Paramount has not disclosed how much Kushner would contribute to the Paramount-Warner deal.

Liccardo’s Northern California district includes Los Gatos, where Netflix is based. Liccardo, in the interview, said Netflix was unaware of his effort until after the letter was drafted.

Over the weekend, Trump said the proposed Netflix purchase, which would give the streaming company an even more commanding presence in the industry, “could be a problem.” The president on Wednesday said he wanted CNN to be included in the deal because he doesn’t trust “the people that are running that company right now.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has voiced concerns about Netflix’s dominance should it acquire Warner.

“The Netflix purchase of Warner Bros. would be a disaster,” Murphy wrote on X last weekend. “It’s patently illegal. But there are some quietly rooting for it because a Paramount takeover (that includes CNN) would be worse.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08923d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4152x2180+0+294/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2Ff1%2F81f4980c4e279fcd62e260fb5feb%2F3d08c6b11ed54ca3926ddc18fc893003.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:45.213405

Searches for “alien,” “overstay” and “unlawful entry.” Dozens of searches for “immigration,” and “immigration+.” More than 700 searches with just “ICE” as the reason. Hundreds of searches made by Border Patrol and Homeland Security.

For the first six months of 2025, federal and out-of-state law enforcement agencies across the country searched Spokane County Flock cameras, in many cases explicitly using the technology to hunt down undocumented immigrants.

In Washington, state law prevents local and state resources from being used to assist in federal immigration enforcement. But as electeds like the Spokane City Council celebrate the Keep Washington Working Act for protecting immigrants and Congressman Michael Baumgartner criticizes it for “prioritizing criminal aliens over law-abiding citizens,” the law has proven ineffectual when it comes to protecting immigrants’ data from federal overreach.

As news has continued to break statewide that Washington immigrants’ data has been accessed by federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol through weak protection mechanisms at the Department of Licensing and access to local Flock networks given by agencies across the state, documents obtained by RANGE show that Spokane County is no exception.

Earlier this year, we requested a network audit of all searches of the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office’s (SCSO) Flock network made between January 1, 2025 to June 23, 2025, which shows the requesting agency, the search reason they gave, any case number attached, when they searched and how many networks and cameras they searched from.

According to the audit, US Border Patrol (USBP) had direct access to search Spokane County Flock cameras through at least June 23. They used that access to search Spokane County cameras 186 times, with nine of those searches specifically looking for people in Washington.

The searches made directly by USBP are just the tip of the iceberg; reporting by 404 Media revealed that ICE had access to Flock cameras across the country through a login registered to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which performed hundreds of searches nationally during 2025.

That HSI account made 182 searches on Spokane County cameras in the first six months of 2025.

While some of the HSI searches make a clear case for why they’re using Flock cameras, citing “Human trafficking,” or a specific case number, many of their requests had no case number attached and used vague terms like “investigative,” “officer safety,” or “Linked to an ongoing investigations [sic],” in the search field, which makes it nearly impossible to tell who or what they were actually looking for with those searches.

Spokane County Sheriff John Nowels told The Spokesman Review in October that agencies like Border Patrol and ICE do not have immediate access to the county Flock database. However, the network audit shows these searches were being made all the way up until the last active day of our request — June 23. The sheriff’s office has been unable to say exactly when they turned off the national look-up feature, which allowed federal and out-of-state agencies blanket permission to search local cameras.

What is Flock and who else has access to these cameras?

Flock is a surveillance technology brand that sells a specific brand of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) that are used on a subscription model by law enforcement agencies across the state.

The cameras constantly log photos of any car that drives past them, whether that driver has potentially committed a crime or not, which is then stored for up to 30 days in a database owned by the law enforcement agencies. That database can then be searched by whoever has a direct log-in to it, or any agencies that it has been shared with. Read more about Flock cameras in our region and where they’re located here.

The county currently has more than 60 Flock cameras operational in the region, including mobile Flock cameras mounted on cars that travel the county.

The side door

Flock software is somewhat complex to describe, but essentially there are settings SCSO can toggle on and off. They can add organizations to a list that are allowed to search their data, which researchers at the University of Washington (UW) call “front door” access. SCSO can also turn on or off a “National Look-up” feature, which allows organizations across the country to search their cameras without express agency-level permission. This is what UW researchers call “back door access.”

It’s unclear what SCSO’s network settings are and whether they share camera access with Border Patrol directly or if these searches were made through “back door” access because RANGE’s public records requests for that information sent in August have not yet been filled.

Direct searches from Border Patrol and ICE weren’t the only way Spokane cameras were used to assist in federal operations. At least 45 out-of-state agencies, mostly local police departments from red states, made more than 1,000 immigration-related searches on Spokane County cameras.

Search reasons included “immigration violations,” “immigration overstay,” “alien” and “ice pick-up,” among others. There were also other searches that we can’t say with 100% certainty are for immigration reasons, but raised some red flags, like: “suspicious traveler” “overstay,” and “suspicious vehicle at border entry.” Even searches for “missing/endangered” people could be suspicious, given that Texas sheriffs searched for a woman who got an abortion — who they were investigating for the death of her fetus — and publicly stated it was for a welfare check.

More than 700 searches were made — mostly from police departments in Florida, Georgia and Texas — that just gave “ICE” as their search reason.

The researchers at UW call these searches made by one agency on behalf of another agency “side door access.”

This has gone as far as Illinois police officer Todd Hutchison giving his log in to a DEA agent who made immigration-related searches on Hutchison’s account. None of those searches checked Spokane’s cameras, however, six other searches from Hutchison labelled “narcotics,” do appear on the log.

In October, Sheriff John Nowels told The Spokesman that if federal agencies asked for information related to a criminal investigation, his office would provide it, but that hadn’t happened yet. “If in fact we have provided anything to federal law enforcement offices it would be because of a criminal investigation,” he said.

While SCSO deputies don’t seem to have made any obvious “side door” searches on behalf of ICE or Border Patrol, contrary to what Nowels told The Spokesman, his employees made plenty of searches for other federal law enforcement offices.

We found at least 167 searches made on behalf of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Marshals Service — all federal agencies. Some or all of these searches may have been for active criminal investigations, but it’s impossible to know for sure; only a single one of these searches had a case number attached.

Most search fields simply had things like “usms fugitive,” “ATF Request,” “HSI DEA Assist,” or “usms.”

While SCSO has declined to return multiple requests for comment, they did take an initial phone call from RANGE on Monday, November 24. During that call, Nowels and spokesperson Mark Gregory didn’t deny making searches on behalf of federal agencies.

“We don’t do it for HSI, not even HSI, but we don’t do it for civil detainers, anything like that,” Nowels said. “But if HSI is working a human trafficking case, the US Marshals are out looking for bad guys, we will look stuff up for them and I think it’s appropriate and it does not violate the Keep Washington Working Act.” (A civil immigration detainer is a request to law enforcement to keep a person in local custody for deportation.)

The KWWA states that: “State and local law enforcement agencies may not provide nonpublicly available personal information about an individual, including individuals subject to community custody pursuant to RCW 28 9.94A.701 and 9.94A.702, to federal immigration authorities in a noncriminal matter, except as required by state or federal law.”

After news broke that these kinds of “side door” searches were showing up on cameras across Washington, including Mukilteo, Lynwood and Everett, State Sen. Marko Liias (D-Edmonds) told the Everett Herald that this kind of access “violates the spirit of our Keep Washington Working Act.”

“The goal of the Legislature was that the federal government would manage its immigration enforcement and that our state and local resources would be focused on protecting our communities from more immediate crimes and public safety risks,” Liias told the Herald.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington has maintained that sharing state-collected data like license plate information with federal immigration agencies is against Washington state law, calling the KWWA “the floor, not the ceiling,” of state protections.

Last Wednesday, we asked the SCSO spokesperson Mark Gregory if SCSO was aware that the county Flock cameras were searched for immigration violations, if the county considers these searches to be violations of the KWWA, and if the county was even aware that federal agencies had access to search Spokane County cameras all the way up until at least June 23.

They have declined to answer. We will update the story if they ever do.

The blank door

The front, side and back doors at least leave some kind of trace. The fourth option — which we’re calling “the blank door,” — is more nefarious.

While searches blatantly looking for “immigration” can now be blocked by the network owners, as reporting from The Urbanist pointed out, there is no easy way to curb queries with vague, blank or dishonest search reasons.

In the first six months of 2025, there were almost 70,000 searches on the SCSO cameras where the sole reason given for the search was “investigation” and the case number field was left blank.

When you factor in variations on the term investigation, like “inv,” “INV,” or “investigative,” there are hundreds of thousands of searches made with a vague search reason and no case number listed.

SCSO and Spokane Police Department (SPD) officers combined made at least 81 of those searches, and an additional 20 searches with the reason as “1” and no case number attached.

These kinds of searches with nondescript search fields make it impossible to tell what the user is actually searching for. It could be an immigration-related search on the sly for a federal officer who asked. It could be tracking an ex-girlfriend’s movements. It could also be for an ongoing missing person or murder investigation, but there is no way of knowing when officers include no information on why they’re searching sometimes tens of thousands of cameras for the sole purpose of “investigation.”

Despite the thousands of searches with invalid reasons, Nowels told RANGE last week that they do quarterly audits of Flock searches and that no officer had ever been disciplined for misuse of the system, to his knowledge.

He also said, “Everybody who searches the system, they have to identify what case number they’re using or what reason they’re actually querying the data. You can’t just go in on a free-for-all. There has to be some reason you’re accessing the data.”

SCSO declined to provide current internal policies, but training documents from 2024 that we reviewed state that “investigation” and non-descriptive search reasons are “bad” reasons to search Flock.

We asked the county last week specifically about these searches that are left blank and whether there were any plans to curb this kind of usage of the Flock cameras. We asked what potential consequences an employee might face for misuse of the system.

We also asked how many cases the SCSO has solved specifically because of Flock technology.

They declined to provide answers. If they do, we will update this story.

At least 27 countries — more than half the members of the Council of Europe, the main organization protecting human rights on the continent — have now called for a rethink of the treaty’s interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights, diplomatic sources told AFP after the talks.

They include the United Kingdom, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands — but notably not France or Germany, they said.

ECHR rulings on migration issues have irked several European governments in recent years, including emergency injunctions that on occasion blocked deportations at the last minute.

“We are facing real and big challenges and migration issues are one of those concerns,” Council of Europe secretary general Alain Berset, who convened the meeting of justice ministers and other key officials, told reporters.

He insisted that the discussion in Strasbourg had not been about “changing” the convention, but described the charter as a “living instrument” that had evolved since it was written up decades ago.

The countries are particularly concerned with the interpretation of the convention’s right to a private and family life, and how this risks being used to prevent removal of individuals who these states say have no right to remain.

Writing in Britain’s Guardian daily Wednesday, U.K. premier Keir Starmer and his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen said the ministers meeting in Strasbourg would “push for a modernization of the interpretation” of the convention.

That would allow it to “evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century,” they said.

The British government, which has long aired concerns over the treaty, has faced calls from the right to quit the convention after London’s exit from the European Union.

But Berset pointedly added that all 46 member states had affirmed “their deep and abiding commitment to both the court and the convention.”

A “political declaration” would be prepared for a ministerial meeting next year as a “first step” on finding a way forward.

‘Contemporary challenges’

The Council of Europe was set up in the wake of World War II as the guardian of human rights in Europe in a move championed by British wartime premier Winston Churchill, with its member states signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights.

Its implementation is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights, an instance of last resort.

Next year’s political declaration would set out the “obligation to ensure the effective enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention to everyone within the jurisdiction of member states,” according to the ministerial conclusions.

But they would have to be “in the context of the contemporary challenges posed both by irregular migration and by the situation of foreigners convicted of serious offences,” they continued.

The 27 states seeking further action have urged a “balance” between the individual rights of migrants and “the public interest in defending freedom and security,” according to a document seen by AFP.

U.K. Justice Minister David Lammy, who is also Starmer’s deputy, emphasized that the United Kingdom “is committed to the convention.”

But he added: “To secure its future, we must ensure it evolves — striking the balance between individual rights and public interest to deliver peace, stability and security for the 21st century.”

‘Inaccuracies and assumptions’

France, which is not among the states calling for changes, “confirms its commitment to the independence of the court,” Pap Ndiaye, France’s ambassador to the Council of Europe, told AFP, denouncing an “insidious” move by the 27 fellow members.

The Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights Michael O’Flaherty meanwhile urged the ministers to be “assiduously evidence-based.”

He expressed concern over “inaccuracies and assumptions currently in circulation,” in particular the notion that changing the convention would “impact irregular migratory flows.”

“You are embarked on an extremely consequential pathway in terms of the well-being of Europe’s human rights protection system,” he said.

At issue is Senate Bill 76 — authored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, after she blocked a bill with some similar provisions during the last legislative session. That move resulted in Rokita claiming she did so because she has an “illegal alien” in her family.

Her current proposal includes language allowing state agencies and Rokita’s office to investigate the “employment of an unauthorized alien” and report possible violations to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Indiana Department of Labor.

Rokita, however, is backing a differing proposal in Senate Bill 122, which would give the attorney general’s office authority to seek court orders suspending an “employer’s operating authorizations” over such suspected violations.

Rokita, a Republican, blasted Brown on social media over her bill, saying she had “introduced a watered-down, bizarro world version … that takes all the enforcement teeth out of the bill. That makes her bill meaningless.”

Brown countered that she has worked with entities from the Trump administration to county sheriffs in order to find effective ways to help enforce federal immigration laws.

“The biggest thing is making sure that we didn’t grow government and that the power isn’t centered in one agency or individual,” Brown told reporters.

Hiring practices in question

Erin Tuttle, the attorney general office’s legislative director, criticized Brown’s bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally.

“The Supreme Court has confirmed that states may sanction the license of employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers,” Tuttle said. “If Indiana refuses to adopt the one enforcement mechanism available under federal law, it cannot credibly claim to be a leader in combating illegal immigration.”

Immigrant advocates, however, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation.

Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, told committee members that the proposal encourages racial profiling by businesses.

“It pushes them toward discriminatory hiring practices, meaning someone who fits a certain look or has a certain name or has an accent may be discriminated against, just out of precaution,” Castoreno said. “We know who is harmed, people with brown skin, people with accents, people with names that sound unfamiliar to an HR manager.”

Committee members voted 6-2 along party lines to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in early January.

Rokita-Brown conflict continues

The dispute between Rokita and Brown over the legislation grows out of their conflict over an immigration-enforcement bill from the legislative session earlier this year.

House members approved House Bill 1531 in February, but Brown did not hold a Senate committee hearing on the bill and it died when the legislative session ended in April.

Rokita then claimed Brown had blocked the legislation because she had a “family member who’s an illegal alien.”

Brown called that claim “blatantly false.” She also filed an attorney misconduct grievance over Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission that she said Tuesday was still pending.

Rokita and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over last session’s bill.

They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a Republican primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.

Following the committee vote, Rokita posted to X that the bill “would actively shield sanctuary jurisdictions and directly undermines our ongoing lawsuits to end sanctuary policies in Monroe and St. Joseph counties. We need to stop illegal immigration—not protect the counties and officials who defy state law and put Hoosier families last.”",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Indiana-Statehouse-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:55.432750

In a complaint filed Wednesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court, advocacy groups Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition and Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice said the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office violated state law by agreeing to house federal detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service.

“The county cannot allow federal agents to use our local jail as a pipeline to immigration detention,” said David Henretty, an attorney at Oregon Law Center, which is representing the groups.

“When a judge says you’re free, you’re free. That’s not optional,” he said. “Oregon law requires it, and this lawsuit will enforce it.”

Immigration Customs and Enforcement, or ICE, aren’t the ones carrying out immigration operations. In January, the Department of Homeland Security authorized other federal law enforcement to carry out the functions of an immigration officer, including the U.S. Marshals.

“As immigrant communities face increasing threats from federal agents, they need to know that Oregon will back them up with action, not just words,” a spokesperson for PIRC said in a press release.

“We are taking action so jails follow the law and release people when judges order them free.”

According to the lawsuit, the sheriff’s office entered into an agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service in October 2019 to lodge federal detainees at county jail facilities, including those who are awaiting immigration or deportation proceedings.

The advocacy groups are asking for a court order requiring the sheriff’s office to revise its agreement with the U.S. Marshals, to either stop holding detainees for immigration purposes or terminate the agreement if they refuse.

The assertion, contained in a response to a public information request from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, contradicted the Trump administration’s sworn court testimony and the fact that it had previously submitted video footage to a judge. The response also raised questions about whether the administration is fully complying with a court order that required the use of body cameras in the monthslong operation, which has included a string of allegations of excessive force.

“Sometimes a no response is more telling than having records” from a public information request, said Anne Weismann, who oversaw records litigations at the Justice Department at the end of her two decades at the department. “And this may be one of those cases.”

In a letter dated Tuesday, ICE told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that “no records responsive to your request were found.” The foundation had requested “all body-worn camera footage” taken as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which was announced in September. Judge Sara L. Ellis, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, had mandated that agents, including ones at ICE, wear body cameras beginning in October.

Experts in public records laws say such a response is a troubling sign that the Trump administration may be trying to evade public oversight mechanisms. Its immigration enforcement agencies are accused of violating civil liberties and state laws while they strive to meet the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation goal of one million people per year.

The response “indicates that ICE continues to feel increasing impunity” as an agency “exempt from accountability,” said Lauren Harper, who advocates for government transparency at the nonprofit. “It is extremely implausible that ICE does not have any of this footage — it just strikes me as beyond the pale.”

Neither ICE, in its letter, nor the Department of Homeland Security, in a response to questions from The New York Times, directly explained why the letter said there were no records of body camera footage even though administration lawyers had submitted such clips to Judge Ellis.

ICE’s letter implied that such records might be shielded, citing some exemptions to open records laws, including ones on national security, ongoing criminal investigations and information that can expose government informants’ identities. Ms. Weismann said the requested records did not qualify for such exemptions “under any reasonable interpretation.”

But in an emailed statement, the Homeland Security Department seemed to imply that such footage might not even exist, emphasizing the limits of the body camera requirements, saying they applied only to immigration agents who already had cameras and had been trained to use them.

“The premise of your story is false and overly simplifies the court’s relevant order,” the department said in its statement. “ICE never violated the court order.”

The limited known camera footage in the operation has already caused legal problems for the Trump administration. Judge Ellis used the clips submitted to her to rule that officers acted illegally with excessive force.

The letter also arrived as the Homeland Security Department and the Trump administration have faced repeated questions on their willingness to abide by public records laws.

In August, the department rebuffed a request for public records related to the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles this summer, saying that the agency had not maintained text message data among top officials since early April. The agency later attributed the lapse in data storage to its decision to stop using software that automatically captured officials’ text message data and instead to require officials to manually take screenshots of their messages for compliance.

Under the Federal Records Act, government agencies are required to preserve all documentation that officials and federal workers produce while executing their duties, and they have to make federal records available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act unless they fall under certain exemptions.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/10/multimedia/10dc-dhs-foia-mzqc/10dc-dhs-foia-mzqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 01:56:23.813081

Quick Hits

In its 2025–26 term, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship.

Oral arguments are expected to take place in the spring of 2026; the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

Although the executive order is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision, USCIS has issued guidance outlining how the order would be applied and enforced, if upheld.

In January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14160, which aimed to place restrictions on birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who were present in the country temporarily or without lawful status. The order would significantly abridge the long-standing constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for virtually all children born in the United States, as recognized in the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The order has not yet taken effect; multiple lawsuits produced preliminary injunctions in the lower courts. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published an implementation plan in July, outlining how the order would be applied.

Background on EO 14160

Section 1 of the executive order provides that a child born in the United States would no longer automatically be entitled to citizenship at birth in two situations: (1) when the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; or (2) when the mother’s presence was lawful but temporary (for example, under the Visa Waiver Program or on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

EO 14160 directs federal agencies to withhold citizenship documentation for such births, with the policy applying prospectively thirty days after the order, while clarifying that it does not affect, for example, children of lawful permanent residents. The order frames this position as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 8 U.S.C. § 1401’s “subject to the jurisdiction” language.

Legal Challenges to EO 14160

Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the executive order on birthright citizenship as unconstitutional under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment (the “Citizenship Clause”). Federal district judges in Washington State and Maryland entered injunctions blocking enforcement while the cases proceeded. In late June, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court curtailed federal district courts’ use of so-called nationwide (universal) injunctions, without resolving the order’s constitutionality, and litigation continued in the lower courts.

Following CASA, in Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction and an order granting provisional class certification, which prevented the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a certified class of babies born on or after February 20, 2025, who otherwise would be denied U.S. citizenship under the executive order. And in State of Washington v. Trump, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the executive order was “invalid because it contradict[ed] the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

In September 2025, the Trump administration’s lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court for review. The Trump administration’s certiorari petition requested that the Supreme Court review both Washington and Barbara; however, the Court’s order of December 5, 2025, indicates it will only take up the issue in Barbara. The case, expected to be argued in the spring with a definitive ruling to be issued by the end of June or early July 2026, will likely determine the future of birthright citizenship in the United States.

USCIS’s Implementation Plan for EO 14160

Although the EO is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Barbara, USCIS’s implementation plan, released on July 25, 2025, outlines how the order would be applied if it were ultimately upheld. The memo explains that “unlawfully present” refers to people in the United States without permission or those who have stayed longer than allowed, as defined in Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It also explains the difference between “unlawful status” and “unlawfully present.” For example, people paroled into the United States might not have a lawful immigration status, but they are not considered unlawfully present if they have permission to stay from the attorney general.

Since the term “lawful but temporary” presence isn’t clearly defined in the INA, USCIS has provided its own definition. This includes people who are in the United States legally for a limited time or under conditions that require them to reapply for continued stay. Examples include nonimmigrants, parolees, temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries, and deferred action recipients. USCIS also addresses the status of children born in the United States to parents with lawful but temporary status. These children do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents are not U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or U.S. nationals. To avoid negative immigration consequences for these children, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and USCIS propose allowing them to register and acquire the lawful status of at least one parent.

This proposal is similar to existing provisions for children of foreign diplomats born in the United States, who can acquire lawful immigration status through registration. Until this proposal is implemented, DHS suggests deferring immigration enforcement actions, including detention, removal, or deportation against these children, even though they may not be recognized as U.S. citizens under the proposed policy.

If the constitutionality of the executive order is upheld, a U.S. birth certificate alone would no longer suffice as proof of citizenship. Parents would need to provide documentation of the mother’s lawful status or the father’s citizen or permanent resident status.

Next Steps

With the executive order’s enforcement currently halted, the future of this policy remains uncertain. The Supreme Court will determine whether to uphold EO 14160, with significant implications for foreign nationals in the United States, depending on the scope of the ruling. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June or July of 2026.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14838_2817.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:00:34.736082

“ICE is disproportionately targeting Latinos for arrest, both nationally and in New York state,” Vice President of Policy at the New York Immigration Coalition Mario Bruzzone explained.
“For example, Ecuadorians are 4% of non-citizens in New York State, but they are 24.9% of ICE arrests.
Mexicans are 5.6% of non-citizens but they’re 9.9% of ICE arrests.
Over the last six months, amNewYork has documented the impacts of ICE arrests at Federal Plaza court proceedings and around the Big Apple.","ICE arrests in New York and other parts of America have disproportionately targeted Latino individuals for arrest and potential deportation, a new report has found.

Revealed by the New York Immigration Coalition, the report examined data gathered from the University of California, Berkeley on immigration arrests made from the final year of the Biden administration on Jan. 1, 2024, to the first six months of the Trump administration ending in July 2025, and focuses on New York state.

Even though Central and South American residents make up just a quarter of the city’s immigrant population, the report found that immigrants from Central and South America comprised nearly three-fourths of all ICE arrests in the Big Apple.

“ICE is disproportionately targeting Latinos for arrest, both nationally and in New York state,” Vice President of Policy at the New York Immigration Coalition Mario Bruzzone explained. “For example, Ecuadorians are 4% of non-citizens in New York State, but they are 24.9% of ICE arrests. Mexicans are 5.6% of non-citizens but they’re 9.9% of ICE arrests. Guatemalans are 1.6% of non-citizens but 8.4% of ICE arrests. Hondurans 1.3% of non-citizens but 6.0% of ICE arrests and so forth.”

Bruzzone went on to state that the report also found that the person’s Latino country of origin did not matter — the individuals were apprehended based merely on their ethnicity.

“What we want to show here and emphasize is that it doesn’t matter what country of Latin America you come from, you are disproportionately subject to arrest at a population level,” Bruzzone added.

The statistics also show that men are prime targets of ICE. Although they make up 50% of the immigrant population, the numbers show that males make up 89% of those arrested by ICE.

Over the last six months, amNewYork has documented the impacts of ICE arrests at Federal Plaza court proceedings and around the Big Apple. In many instances, the individuals arrested were men and the primary source of household income — forcing their wives and children to struggle with food and financial insecurity without them.

In two such examples, Alexandra Alvarez, was left alone with her less than one-year-old baby, while Jessica Supliguicha was left to care for a newborn and a 9-year-old child, after ICE agents arrested their husbands.

According to Chloe East, associate professor of Economics at the University of Colorado Boulder, law enforcement arrests of immigrants with criminal records have decreased, while street raids that happen on the corners of blocks, apartment complexes, and other community areas are on the rise.

“Almost 70% of people who are arrested have no criminal conviction,” East said. “Every time ICE ramps up its community arrests, its ability to prioritize individuals with criminal records goes down.”

Border Czar Tom Homan has repeatedly claimed that ICE is targeting “the worst of the worst,” meaning immigrants with criminal backgrounds. The reality, however, is that often ICE agents in New York and elsewhere are abducting an array of individuals — men, women, and children — regardless of their background.

Previous reports in amNewYork have shown masked ICE agents pulling children from their families and pulling pedestrians without a criminal history into unmarked cars.

While ICE arrests in the Big Apple have not been as heavy as those found in other cities and states across the country, such as Los Angeles, the Immigration Coalition warns that if Trump were to order a federal takeover of New York, those numbers would rapidly increase.",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-17.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-12-11 02:57:28.402049

The number of detainees dropped from a peak of up to 700 detainees in May to approximately 340 as of late November, according to data from the Deportation Data Project, run by a team of lawyers and academics who analyze ICE data they receive via public records requests.

According to that data and interviews with people with regular access to the jail, the decline began on or shortly after Oct. 31, when an intergovernmental service agreement between ICE and Torrance County expired without explanation.

Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

The contract’s expiration means ICE no longer pays roughly $2.5 million monthly to private contractor CoreCivic, Torrance County officials said during a County Commission meeting Wednesday in Estancia. Officials told Source New Mexico they are concerned about the potential economic implications for the county, which relies on the jail as a major employer and tax revenue source, if the population continues to decline and no contract extension is reached.

While the expiration and subsequent detainee decline have no immediate financial implications for the county, County Manager Jordan Barela said he is keenly interested in what a new contract might say and what that could mean for the jail’s future.

“The big financial obligation would be if the facility closed, because we lose that guaranteed revenue and, two, now we incur the expenses of having to transport our inmates miles away to other counties,” he said.

Immigrant advocates, however, said they remain concerned that CoreCivic, the private company, no longer has any financial incentive or legal reason to provide adequate care at a facility they say already has a long history of substandard care.

“Conditions there could continue to decline, and it’s alarming that hundreds of people are being held in New Mexico under no apparent authority,” Zoe Bowman, managing attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, which has clients at the jail, told Source New Mexico.

The expiration has renewed calls from advocates and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) that ICE immediately stop housing detainees in Torrance County. Standard operating procedures require that ICE remove all detainees and equipment absent a contract, and Heinrich has pressed ICE’s director to explain what legal authority it has to continue holding detainees.

The decrease in population identified in the Deportation Data Project has continued into December, according to PJ Podesta, a senior program manager for Innovation Law Lab, which conducts weekly jail visits. His best estimate is that 250 ICE detainees are at the jail, based on conversations with detainees in different pods.

NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The decline is “striking,” Bowman said, given that the number of ICE detainees is increasing or staying level at New Mexico’s other two ICE detention facilities in Milan and Chaparral, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearing House, along with other facilities across the country amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push.

“The Trump administration is doing absolutely everything they can to detain as many people as possible and fill ICE detention beds,” she said.

Podesta and Rogelio Bolufé, a Cuban immigrant detained at the facility who says he’s also witnessed the decline, told Source that they believe the reduction in population is because CoreCivic is not admitting new detainees, while ICE is transferring detainees out at the usual rate.

The detainees Podesta has been able to track from Estancia have mostly ended up at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

Source New Mexico asked ICE and CoreCivic on Tuesday about whether a decrease has occurred and, if so, what the reason might be behind it, including whether the expired contract played a role. Source also asked what a decline in detainees could mean for the future of the facility.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment. CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd did not address those questions in an emailed response to Source New Mexico, though he noted that the population “may fluctuate week to week” at the jail.

“But there is nothing out of the ordinary and our operations have remained unchanged,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3119-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 02:57:31.851902

“He was trying to be strong for his wife and kids in the car, but the anxiety and fear were palpable,” she said. “His wife was trying to hold back tears, but I could see her in the rearview mirror silently crying.”

They had fled Afghanistan under threat by the Taliban because the wife’s father had assisted the U.S. military, and they had asked for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, Garcia said. She is not identifying him or his family for fear other members could be arrested.

Afghan men arrested in wake of shooting

Since the Nov. 26 Guard shooting, The Associated Press has tracked roughly two dozen arrests of Afghan immigrants, most of which happened in Northern California. In Sacramento, home to one of the nation’s largest Afghan communities, volunteers monitoring ICE activities say they witnessed at least nine arrests at the federal building last week after Afghan men received calls to check in there.

Many of those detained had requested asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in the last two years. Others were among the 76,000 Afghans brought to the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome, created by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the chaotic withdrawal of the U.S. from their country.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Dec. 1 that the Trump administration is “actively reexamining” all the Afghan nationals who entered the U.S. during Biden’s administration.

The AP couldn’t independently determine each of the Afghans’ immigration statuses or the reasons put forward by authorities for their arrests. In one case, the man had been arrested twice on suspicion of domestic violence, according to the government.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland, said in an email that the agency “has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden’s fraudulent parole programs and working to get the criminals and public safety threats OUT of our country.”

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the 29-year-old Afghan suspect in the shooting, was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

Critics say Afghans paying price for one bad actor

Since the shooting, the U.S. government introduced sweeping immigration changes, including pausing asylum applications and requiring increased vetting for immigrants from certain countries. The administration also took steps specifically targeted at Afghans, including pausing all their immigration-related applications and visas for Afghans who closely helped the war effort.

Those who work with Afghans say the stepped-up enforcement amounts to the collective punishment of a population, many of whom risked their lives to protect U.S. troops.

“Not to discount the horrific killing that happened, but that was one bad actor who should be prosecuted by the full extent of the law,” Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, whose California district includes Sacramento, said of Lakanwal. “A lot of these people kept our troops safe and served side by side with our soldiers for two decades in Afghanistan.”

Cuffed after reporting to ICE

In Sacramento, Afghan men arrived one by one to the ICE office Dec. 1 after being asked to immediately report there, drawing the attention of volunteers who have been at the federal building for more than six months to monitor ICE activities and alert immigrants.

As each man entered the office, agents handcuffed them, said Garcia, a volunteer with NorCal Resist.

“What we saw on Monday was an influx of Afghan immigrants called randomly starting at 6 a.m. and asked to do a check-in and report immediately,” Garcia said. “Most of these Afghan men already had ankle monitors on them.”

Her organization’s volunteers witnessed ICE arrest six Afghans that day.

Arrests and cancellations cause fear

In Des Moines, Iowa, Ann Naffier, with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, said her Afghan client was detained Dec. 2 on the way to work by agents who called him a “terrorist.” He was held for two hours before he was released with an apology.

Wahida Noorzad is an immigration attorney in Northern California who has two Afghan clients who were arrested last week by ICE. Both entered the U.S. in recent years through the southern border. One used the app set up by the Biden administration to make an appointment to request asylum at the border.

Noorzad felt both had strong cases to eventually be granted asylum in the U.S. She also said she found no criminal records for them.

Spojmie Nasiri, another immigration attorney in Northern California, said she’s received numerous calls from worried Afghans, including a man who called her terrified as agents stood outside his home. He put her on speaker phone so she could tell them that her client was a U.S. citizen.

Iqbal Wafa, an Afghan immigration consultant in Sacramento, said officials told his client when he went to his appointment last week that interviews for Afghans are canceled, and he observed interviews for other Afghan immigrants were canceled as well inside the federal building in Sacramento.

His client, who asked to be identified only by his last name, Mohammadi, out of fear his comments could affect the safety of relatives in Afghanistan, said he came to the U.S. with his family in 2017 after working as a security guard for both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineering and the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan for 12 years. He said he watched last week as other people who weren’t Afghans went into their interviews before learning his was canceled.

“I started thinking, ‘I haven’t done anything,’” Mohammadi said. He said he felt betrayed after the hard work that led up to the interview for U.S. citizenship. “What will happen to our futures?”

Rohullah R., 30, wondered the same. He worked at an animal shelter in Kabul, Afghanistan, and came to the U.S. in 2024 after being sponsored by a New York animal welfare organization. He did not want his last name used out of fear it would harm his case. He said the pause on his green card application process has “created a lot of challenges” and for many Afghans like him their “spirit is down.”

A family left crying

Garcia said she listened through the wall of the waiting room at the ICE office and heard agents handcuff the father of the family she was helping.

“I’m screaming his rights through the wall so he could hear me. ‘Remain silent! Please don’t sign anything!’” she said. She left after security approached.

When she walked out of the building without him, she said his wife broke down sobbing.

Their daughter tried to console her, telling her, “Mommy, don’t cry. Everything will be OK when daddy comes.”

Now, last year my predecessor set out the FCDO’s approach to human rights and governance.
Because it is only when human rights are protected that everyone has the chance to live with dignity and freedom.","Good morning.

It’s great to see you all today.

The UN’s theme this year - “Human Rights, Our Everyday Essentials” – couldn’t be more timely.

And it really resonates with me after my visit to Jamaica to see the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, just five short days ago.

We often speak about our basic human rights and needs in jest, but meeting a seven year old boy - who will be eight-years-old on the 28th of December - in Jamaica last week, whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Melissa and whose only Christmas wish was a working toilet, brought home to me the stark reality of millions around the world living without these essentials, whether through disaster, poverty, conflict or political oppression.

Hurricane Melissa was devastating, and I pay tribute to the Government of Jamaica and its people for their extraordinary response and resilience in the face of such hardship.

Today we reflect on how human rights are at the heart of our daily lives and when I talk about human rights, I also mean democracy and the rule of law.

The three go hand in hand.

Yet today, more and more people threaten to roll-back our hard-won freedoms.

That’s why our commitment to human rights – here at home and around the world – matter.

Not just because it’s morally and legally right, though of course it is, but because it’s in our shared interest. They allow us as individuals, as communities and as societies to thrive and prosper.

As an MP, I’ve seen people campaigning for fairness, equality and safety.

From local charities helping the homeless, to residents campaigning for clean air, to families hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees.

This is civic engagement at its best – people exercising their rights to speak out, to organise, to assemble, and to live free from discrimination.

But it’d be a mistake to think that human rights are there just to protect our freedoms.

Because they also serve our national interest, our security, our growth and our long-term prosperity.

Respect for the rule of law gives businesses confidence.

Economic and social rights help create a healthy, educated workforce.

And the right to life, freedom from torture, freedom of religion or belief and expression keep us safe.

Security and prosperity cannot be achieved without guaranteeing human rights.

How we protect rights must also evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.

We believe in the European Convention on Human Rights.

It helped create a neighbourhood of countries with a strong record on human rights, directly contributing to the peace and security Europe has enjoyed since the second world war.

It has also delivered real benefits for British people - a full inquest for the families of the Hillsborough victims, the abolition of corporal punishment in schools, and the right for gay people to serve in our armed forces.

So of course, the UK remains committed to the Convention.

At the same time, we also believe that it must evolve to face the challenges of the day.

As the Prime Minister has said, we need to modernise how it’s interpreted in the context of irregular migration.

And that work is already underway, with the Deputy Prime Minister in Strasbourg today meeting other Justice Ministers to take it forward.

But laws and conventions only matter if they make a difference to real lives.

And right now, across the world, too many lives are under attack.

Palestinians assaulted in olive groves in the West Bank.

Women in the DRC raped with impunity.

Prisoners tortured in Damascus.

Children killed by missiles in Ukraine.

And crimes in Sudan so appalling that they can be seen from satellites in space.

These are outrageous examples of tragedies, entirely inconsistent with international human rights and humanitarian law, and they are unfolding as we speak.

They remind us why we must act.

Doing nothing will only normalise impunity, making everyone, everywhere less safe.

That is why FCDO funds partners in Syria to document atrocities and build evidence to achieve accountability.

That is why we work with leaders like Nobel Laureate Dr Denis Mukwege on a survivor-centred approach when addressing sexual violence.

And that’s why the Foreign Secretary, who sends her apologies today, is personally determined to end impunity for sexual violence in conflict, pursue peace in Gaza and the West Bank, and drive urgent action in Sudan.

But we cannot do this alone.

Today as we mark the end of 16 days of Activism to End Gender-Based Violence, it is clear that we all have a role to play.

Over the last two weeks, my officials have met activists and organisations working to stop violence against women and girls in Sudan and elsewhere.

We want to do everything possible to help amplify their calls for justice and change and it makes me immensely grateful for the work you do.

Not just in responding to these issues but in raising their profile, keeping the pressure on us to act, and holding us to account to do so.

That’s why I’m concerned that civil society is under attack in so many countries because of repressive legislation.

I want to pay particular tribute to courageous human rights defenders and advocates around the world, putting their lives in danger day after day to fight for what’s right.

I’m honoured that some of them are with us today, and I look forward to hearing from them shortly.

Now, last year my predecessor set out the FCDO’s approach to human rights and governance.

I’m proud of the progress we’ve made since then and I will build on this excellent work.

We’ve strengthened the rule of law worldwide by offering free legal expertise in over 50 countries.

We’re holding war criminals to account, including for war crimes committed in Ukraine.

We helped set up the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group which supports the Ukrainian government in delivering justice.

We’re supporting the establishment for a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, and I am pleased that we formally endorsed its legal basis earlier this year.

And we’re championing equal rights for all, including through the Deputy Prime Minister’s powerful global campaign to ensure every child grows up in a safe, loving family environment.

Yet there is still so much to do.

And that’s why I’m pleased that the UK has been re-elected to serve on the UN Human Rights Council for the next two years, giving us the chance to share our experiences with others.

Now, while this is a significant opportunity, I know that many of you are concerned about cuts in our foreign aid budgets.

So I want to reassure you that we’re determined to find new innovative ways to support change on the ground, working ever more closely with local actors, focusing on impact, and publicly reporting what we do.

And all of this will be backed by a strong diplomatic network of Embassies and High Commissions who will continue to champion these agendas around the world.

And we’ll use our influence in the multilateral system to keep human rights at the heart of its work while making sure they remain the foundation of all that FCDO does.

Because it is only when human rights are protected that everyone has the chance to live with dignity and freedom. And that freedom being understood.

Thank you all.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-11 12:00:16.997621

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is a different kind of immigration agency from others in the government. It's where people go when they want to apply for asylum or get a green card or even become a citizen. But the Trump administration is now using this agency to clamp down on legal forms of migration. NPR's immigration policy reporter, Ximena Bustillo, is following this story, Hi, Ximena.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: Tell us a bit more about what this agency does compared to the other immigration agencies we've heard.

BUSTILLO: So USCIS is housed within the Homeland Security Department, and that means it's under the same department as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. But USCIS has not been responsible for making arrests, putting people in detention or facilitating deportations. They're a lot more like a customer service agency. So people come to them and say, hey, I want to apply for asylum or I want to apply for a green card, and USCIS processes those applications and decides if that person qualifies or not. Even their funding is completely different. ICE and Customs and Border Protection are funded by Congress. USCIS is actually funded by the fees people pay when they apply for these things.

DETROW: So that's the baseline, that's how the agency has been working. How has the administration changed things?

BUSTILLO: Posts on social media mostly seem to reference immigration fraud and warn immigrants that they could be deported if they commit it. The director, Joseph Edlow, has emphasized that USCIS is going to be an enforcement agency. Here he is at his Senate confirmation hearing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOSEPH EDLOW: My vision for USCIS is simple. I will restore integrity within the legal immigration system. While the whole Department of Homeland Security is working hard to make America safe again, USCIS must play as critical a role in that mission as any other immigration enforcement agency.

BUSTILLO: That rhetoric mirrors the first Trump administration, except this time they are taking it a step further.

DETROW: How so?

BUSTILLO: Well, there are reports that people are being detained at routine green card or citizenship interviews. Immigrants are afraid of engaging with the agency. Here's Eric Welsh, an immigration lawyer in California.

ERIC WELSH: I mean, No. 1 is, am I going to get arrested? No. 1 in almost every type of case, regardless of their past.

BUSTILLO: There has been a string of changes. The agency has rolled out lengthier citizenship tests. It wants to allow officers to consider immigrants' legal use of public benefits like food stamps and health care as a reason to deny legal status. The agency has also dropped the cap of refugee admissions to a historic low of 7,500. And the administration told officers that they will be revetting and reinterviewing those who were granted refugee status under the Biden administration. Then, after an Afghan national was charged in the shooting of two National Guard members, the agency put a pause on all asylum applications, and it paused all applications or approvals for green cards or citizenship, for example, from people of 19 countries on a travel ban list.

DETROW: I mean, that is a lot of drastic steps. How are people within the agency dealing with all these changes?

BUSTILLO: Across the board, employees tell me that they are honestly offended that the administration is implying that they are now enforcing immigration laws and that they weren't before. Some are quitting or taking early retirement offers. They're also feeling out of the loop. The administration terminated the union's contract, and there's been no large meetings or town halls. And that's coming from current and former employees. Workers have been asked to go back to office, but their offices were sometimes makeshift conference rooms and tables. Plus, a lot of the programs that they used to work on have been fairly inactive for most of the year.

USCIS told me that it's a priority to have safety for Americans, but it didn't respond to questions about broader concerns. And the agency is promoting some new roles - homeland defenders and special agents. It's unclear exactly what these positions are going to be responsible for, but some of the job postings specify that these positions are going to be expected to provide direct support to Border Patrol and ICE, which are arresting and deporting immigrants. So there are a lot of questions about this agency's role moving forward.

DETROW: That is NPR's immigration policy reporter, Ximena Bustillo. Thank you so much.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

Pentagon’s requested budget for 2026 indicates the Defense Department plans to spend at least $5 billion more for southern border operations alone

Warren: “It’s an insult to our service members that Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts. Stripping military resources to promote a wasteful political agenda doesn’t make our military stronger or Americans safer.”

Cover Letter to the Pentagon (PDF) | Text of Report (PDF)

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative John Garamendi (D-Calif.) released a new report detailing the Trump administration’s diversion of funds and resources from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement, and its impact on readiness and morale.

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) co-authored the report.

Under a second Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement. Senator Warren’s new report, the first detailed review of the Pentagon’s spending on immigration, found that DoD has committed at least $2 billion to support immigration enforcement through mobilizing and deploying troops to American cities and the Southern border, deporting and transporting immigrants on military aircrafts, detaining individuals on U.S. military installations, and more.

“It’s an insult to our service members that Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts. Stripping military resources to promote a wasteful political agenda doesn’t make our military stronger or Americans safer,” said Senator Warren. “Congress needs to step in and hold the Trump Administration accountable for mishandling billions of taxpayer dollars.”

“When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price. As this report shows, these disruptions come at a significant cost, in both dollars and readiness,” said Representative Garamendi.

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts in support of DHS with money allocated for other DoD projects including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” said the members.

The members’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” wrote the members. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was “understaffed because roughly half its members (were) deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse among service members, and may have even contributed to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

The report also slammed the administration’s failure to adequately inform Congress and the public about the diversion of funds. “The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” said the members.

The coalition directed follow-up questions to Secretary Hegseth about the number of troops currently supporting immigration enforcement, how long military units will be supporting DHS, and whether DHS will reimburse the military.

On Thursday, December 11, 2025, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on deployment of the National Guard across the United States.

The heightened interest in social media screening has drawn concern from immigration and free speech advocates about what the Trump administration is looking for and whether the measures target people critical of the administration in an infringement of free speech rights.","The announcement refers to travelers from more than three dozen countries who take part in the Visa Waiver Program and submit their information to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, which automatically screens them and then approves them for travel to the U.S. Unlike visa applicants, they generally do not have to go into an embassy or consulate for an interview.

DHS administers the program, which currently allows citizens of roughly 40 mostly European and Asian countries to travel to the U.S. for tourism or business for three months without visas.

The announcement also said that CBP would start requesting a list of other information, including telephone numbers the person has used over the past five years or email addresses used over the past decade. Also sought would be metadata from electronically submitted photos, as well as extensive information from the applicant’s family members, including their places of birth and their telephone numbers.

The application that people are now required to fill out to take part in ESTA asks for a more limited set of questions such as parents’ names and current email address.

The public has 60 days to comment on the proposed changes before they go into effect, the notice said.

CBP officials did not immediately respond to questions about the new rules.

The announcement did not say what the administration was looking for in the social media accounts or why it was asking for more information.

But the agency said it was complying with an executive order that Republican President Donald Trump signed in January that called for more screening of people coming to the U.S. to prevent the entry of possible national security threats.

Travelers from countries that are not part of the Visa Waiver Program system are already required to submit their social media information, a policy that dates back to the first Trump administration. The policy remained during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration.

But citizens from visa waiver countries were not obligated to do so.

Since January, the Trump administration has stepped up checks of immigrants and travelers, both those trying to enter the U.S. as well as those already in the country. Officials have tightened visa rules by requiring that applicants set all of their social media accounts to public so that they can be more easily scrutinized and checked for what authorities view as potential derogatory information. Refusing to set an account to public can be considered grounds for visa denial, according to guidelines provided by the State Department.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services now considers whether an applicant for benefits, such as a green card, “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist or antisemitic views.

Seth Moulton wants to allow people to sue federal immigration agents, introducing the cheekily named NOEM Act in Congress just a week after slamming the conditions for detainees at the ICE Boston field office.

Moulton, a North Shore Democrat who launched a primary challenge against Sen. Ed Markey, introduced the National Oversight and Enforcement of Misconduct Act, or NOEM, to amend civil rights law, his office announced Monday.

The bill would include agents from “any federal immigration enforcement authority” to a current civil rights law allowing federal litigation against state and local officials, including police officers. The amendment would target immigration agents, not all federal agents.

Currently, victims have “almost no legal recourse” against ICE agents allegedly violating their Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights of due process and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, Moulton argues.

“The NOEM Act fixes that. ICE is not above the law — and if its officers break the law, they should be held accountable in court,” Moulton said.

The Department of Homeland Security, headed by Secretary Kristi Noem, did not return a request for comment about the amendment.

In a press release, Moulton’s office also pointed to ICE agent’s “near-total immunity when they violate Americans’ rights on the street, during home raids, or in public spaces.”

Currently, people can file a lawsuit under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, where Webster Bivens sued for the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The Bivens action has also been extended to other constitutional rights, they are also limited and challenging, according to the American Immigration Council.

The Supreme Court has also curbed the Bivens path in recent years, Moulton’s office said.

“The forcefulness, lack of communication and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota,” Walz told Noem in his letter.

Walz urged the Homeland Security secretary to find out whether agents possessed a warrant authorizing search and seizure. Any federal agents who acted unlawfully should be placed on administrative leave, Walz wrote.

The Minnesota governor, who is seeking reelection to a third term next year, also asked that Noem clarify the legal standard for citizen observing law enforcement interactions, ensure ICE agents receive clear guidance about respecting the civil rights of U.S. citizens and to “reassess the broader ‘surge’ enforcement strategy.”

The Trump administration has ramped up the presence of federal agents in Minnesota in the past two weeks. It’s unclear how many people have been detained by ICE. DHS has identified 19 people arrested by agents who are allegedly in the U.S. illegally and have criminal records.

""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.","The Trump administration is transforming the agency known for processing green cards and citizenship requests into one of its strongest anti-immigration policing arms.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is one of the three branches of the Homeland Security Department that deals with migration.

Traditionally, its more than 20,000 employees have focused on the various ways people can lawfully immigrate and stay in the U.S. — be that applying for asylum, a green card, citizenship, work visa, or another legal pathway.

Since January, administration officials have taken an axe to that traditional mission by encouraging early retirements, shuttering collective bargaining agreements and drastically cutting back on programs that facilitate legal migration. New job postings lean into the rhetoric of hiring ""homeland defenders"" and tackling fraud.

During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that ""at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.""

The efforts come as President Trump seeks to curb illegal immigration but also reduce legal ways to get to the U.S. and stay here, especially for certain nationalities.

It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.

With the recent changes, at least 1,300 people took the ""Fork in the Road"" resignation offer for federal employees, while others have left on their own. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees were not allowed to take the offer.)

And it's catching immigrants and their families, lawyers and advocates off guard.

""'Am I going to get arrested?' … That's a question, regardless of their past,"" said Eric Welsh, an immigration attorney in California who helps his clients apply for various USCIS programs.

""There really is a lot more fear and there is a lot more concern about, should we do it at all?,"" Welsh said, about people applying for legal status.

Rapid changes after deadly shooting

The changes have been rapid. In recent weeks, the White House said it would re-review all approved refugee claims under the Biden administration.

After an Afghan national was charged for shooting two National Guard members in late November, the administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, and ordered retroactive reviews of already-approved applications.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,"" Trump wrote on social media after the shooting. ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.

""USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,"" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.

""Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.""

Recent policies come after a swath of other changes this year. Policy memos have emphasized that the priority for refugees is admitting those who can easily assimilate into the country, with the target demographic being white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The White House also capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest since the modern refugee program started in the 1980s.

The agency has unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.

Reports of arrests and detention following routine USCIS interviews and appointments have increased fear among immigrants.

""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. ""That's a pretty different stance towards immigration than we've seen over recent decades.""

In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.

""Some people, if they have a green card, might just wait to naturalize and see if they can wait for a new administration,"" Gelatt said.

USCIS leans into enforcement and policing tactics

The new administration has prioritized the agency's law enforcement work.

For example, USCIS has promoted a new role: ""homeland defenders.""

It is unclear exactly what these positions are responsible for. USCIS said they will be ""interviewing aliens, reviewing applications, and identifying criminal or ineligible aliens.""

The posting also specifies this position is expected to provide direct support to CBP and ICE, two agencies leading the effort to arrest, detain and deport immigrants.

The roles also seem to cater to those with backgrounds in traditional law enforcement, contrary to a background in immigration law and administrative government work that is more typical for USCIS.

USCIS said it received some 35,000 applications for the role of ""homeland defender"" and has made ""hundreds"" of job offers, including to former law enforcement officials and veterans, according to a November USCIS press release.

""USCIS is cutting bureaucratic red tape to hire fiercely dedicated, America-first patriots to serve on the frontlines and hold the line against terrorists, criminal aliens, and bad actors intent on infiltrating our nation,"" the release stated.

It also created USCIS special agents, who have law enforcement authority to carry firearms, and investigate, arrest and prosecute immigration cases. In the past, much of this would be the work of ICE or CBP, according to the release announcing the new workforce.

""Certainly the immigration enforcement side of things that are happening has sent a message that anybody who isn't a citizen in the United States could be arrested and put into ICE detention and potentially deported,"" Gelatt said. ""That has a real chilling effect on people's willingness to interact with the government generally, and with USCIS as well.""

USCIS workers defend past enforcement

The changes are having an impact inside the agency, as workers feel out of the loop about the direction and pace of changes.

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees. He says morale is some of the lowest he's seen in his tenure, thanks to the termination of the union contract, a haphazard back-to-office mandate that has employees working in makeshift desks, and a lack of communication from agency leadership.

""There are questions about what will be our mission, what will be our focus? And to that extent, we are alarmed by rhetoric,"" Knowles said. He said the agency has always enforced the nation's immigration laws when it processes applications.

One USCIS refugee officer who recently departed the agency after nearly a decade said the speed of the changes ""overwhelmed"" employees, and recent changes were the last straw. The person spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retaliation from the agency they hope to return to.

USCIS staffers say they have always worked hard to ensure people don't get benefits they do not qualify for, and also look for people who may be breaking the law.

So employees were upset by the administration's implication that they hadn't been doing their jobs properly for the last five years, after the White House announced all refugees admitted under in the Biden era must be reinterviewed.

""It's going to cause a lot of confusion. It's going to cause a lot of chaos. It's going to cost a lot of money,"" the employee said. ""It seems impossible.""

USCIS said it has paused the approvals while it ""works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.

Not ""an adversarial office""

Beyond policy and rhetoric changes, there's been subtler signs of transformation.

Signs inside USCIS offices urge people to leave the country, mirroring the tone of a detention center, rather than that of an immigration office, according to Welsh and other lawyers.

""USCIS is not designed to be an adversarial office,"" he said. ""They're not the enforcers. They're not looking to reduce.""

Now, he said, his clients are concerned with needing to have proof of a good moral character by providing church attendance or charitable donation history, for example.

""It's now certainly not the kind of friendly atmosphere that we used to experience with the agency,"" Welsh said.

Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.

""We have borders and we have benefits. So for people who deserve them or people who have earned them for various reasons, we provide them,"" Welsh said. ""If we just go into a pure enforcement mindset, then there's no happy place to be.""

The agency did not respond to a question about whether immigrants will be deterred from pursuing legal pathways to permanent status.

""The safety of the American people always come [sic] first,"" the agency said in its statement.

After the January fires, thousands of Southern Californians suddenly faced having to apply for FEMA assistance and battle insurance companies to rebuild what was lost.

Faculty, students and volunteers at Pepperdine University were on the ground within days of the Eaton and Palisades fires offering free legal assistance and relaunching the Disaster Relief Clinic, which provided pro bono services after the Thomas and Woolsey fires in 2017 and 2018.

Since then, Pepperdine Caruso School of Law's Disaster Relief Clinic has assisted more than 300 fire survivors, according to the university. The clinic has helped recover at least $750,000 in FEMA assistance and millions more from insurance claims.

“We provide really good legal help for people that have been damaged by the fire[s],” David A. DeJute, the clinic’s director, told LAist. “It makes me feel like I'm providing something of value and worth back to the community.”

About the clinic

The clinic is designed to help fire survivors with a wide variety of legal issues they may face as they go through the recovery and rebuilding process, including having to find rental housing, working with remediation companies to clean up ash and navigating insurance policy limits.

DeJute, who’s also an adjunct professor with Pepperdine’s law school, said the weeks after the fires were a “little like triage” as the clinic focused on helping people prioritize their next steps.

“When you have someone in your family die, you experience trauma and shock and remorse, and nobody is surprised that it affects your mood and your ability to process information,” he said. “Same thing happens when you've lost your home.”

DeJute said some of the most common legal issues that come up at the clinic have to do with FEMA applications, landlords and price gouging.

If a survivor needs more help than the clinic can handle, like with litigation, it will refer them to other lawyers who’ve agreed to take clients pro bono, according to Pepperdine.

The clinic also has trained around 600 lawyers to bring free legal services to their own communities after a disaster, according to the university. DeJute said that includes a student who stepped in to help after the deadly flash flooding in Texas this summer.

A survivor’s story

Pergrin Jung’s family home was “completely destroyed” in the Palisades Fire in what he described to LAist as “the worst days of our lives.”

Jung, like many other survivors, wasn’t sure how to start picking up the pieces.

“Not only were we in a state of shock,” he said. “But also, none of us really knew what the next steps would be.”

Jung reached out for help with an insurance claim for his homeowner’s policy and said the clinic was a “staple” every step of the way. He said students and staff helped explain the legal system, gave feedback on letters he sent to the insurance company and guided his strategy throughout the process.

“Having this resource made all the difference to us,” Jung said. “They were invaluable.”

Resources for fire survivors

You can find wildfire community resources from Pepperdine University here.

Educational experience

The clinic is run by Pepperdine faculty, staff and law students who get hands-on experience operating as attorneys under DeJute’s supervision.

The students are tasked with communicating with clients, diving into details of their legal needs, pushing back against price gouging and managing issues with mortgage companies, to name a few.

Taylor Wedlock, a third-year law student, said the clinic was an opportunity to do her part for the community, especially after her father, an L.A. fire captain, spent about a week fighting the Palisades Fire.

“We weren't just doing FEMA appeals or applications,” she told LAist. “We're going to … help to get this survivor his instruments back so he can so he can start his, you know, his musical career again.”

Wedlock said the clinic helps students apply what they learn in law school textbooks and lectures while exploring the more personal aspect of being a lawyer.

Wedlock recalled the relief in her client’s voice when she got approved for FEMA rental assistance after more than six months of denials, for example. She said she considers that one of her major wins of the semester.

“It may seem impossible to come back from such devastation, but there are options,” Wedlock said. “There are a lot of people who are willing to help.”

How to get involved

People seeking disaster-related legal assistance from the clinic can fill out the request form here. (Please note: A staff attorney or law student will respond to each request, but filling out the form doesn’t create an attorney-client relationship, according to Pepperdine.)

The clinic also has online resources available, including advice on dealing with FEMA and insurance, as well as training for attorneys looking to provide pro bono legal services in their communities.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/33baa26/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7864x4129+0+557/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F75%2F19c4ce254a8b9b5792ec8330b82b%2Fap25184638507161.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:57:46.525514

Mubashir, a U.S. citizen, was on lunch break from his job when ICE agents arrived to arrest him. According to Mubashir, he was slammed to the ground and put into a chokehold.

“I told him, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen, what is going on?'” Mubashir said. “He didn’t seem to care.”

He added that the agent never identified himself as an ICE agent.

“I felt like I was getting assaulted, like I was getting kidnapped,” Mubashir said.

The agent put Mubashir into a squad, where he said ICE needed to verify that Mubashir was a citizen, and, after several failed attempts to scan his face and fingerprints, brought him to the detention center at the Bishop Henry Whipple federal building.

At one point, a man approached the squad with a copy of Mubashir’s passport. But the ICE agent said that Mubashir would still be detained.

Mubashir said he requested water and medical assistance, but was denied water and told there weren’t any medical personnel at the facility.

Finally, Mubashir was given his phone to pull up his identification, and was let go after agents scanned his fingerprints.

When he asked agents to drop him off at the location where he was detained, Mubashir said the agents told him he had to walk home in the snow.

“I asked three times, they said, ‘No, you’re walking,'” Mubashir said. “Eventually, my parents came and picked me up.”

Both Frey and O’Hara condemned the incident.

Frey called out the ICE agents involved for their violence and unwillingness to believe that Mubashir is a citizen.

O’Hara added that city leaders don’t object to lawful arrests, but hope that the arrests can be well-planned for the safety of everybody. He also pointed to stories of ICE agents using what are “at the very least, questionable methods and a use of resources that doesn’t appear to be getting a return on investment,” referencing the detainment of U.S. citizens.

Governor Tim Walz announced Wednesday that he has sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, urging her to review and respond to the arrest of multiple U.S. citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis.

“The forcefulness, lack of communication, and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota,” the letter begins.

Walz referenced the arrests of Susan Tincher and Mubashir — both U.S. citizens. Tincher was acting as a “citizen observer” of ICE arrests when she was arrested.

Huffman released the following statement: “The Trump administration is completely off the rails – launching ruthless attacks in the Caribbean, escalating military tensions in Venezuela, and selling out Ukraine.
Our defense budget is meant to boost military readiness, benefit service members, and help protect our national security – not write a blank check to the Trump administration to wreak any havoc they please.

Denies IVF access to military families: Excludes a provision that would have extended fertility-treatment coverage to all service members.","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) voted against advancing the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) out of the House. In addition to exceeding the overall budget by $8 billion and promoting a series of harmful provisions, the legislation lacks any substantial guardrails to curb the authoritarian agenda of this out-of-control administration. In response to the legislation, Rep. Huffman released the following statement:

“The Trump administration is completely off the rails – launching ruthless attacks in the Caribbean, escalating military tensions in Venezuela, and selling out Ukraine. They’re running amok, and Congressional Republicans are doing nothing to rein them in. Our defense budget is meant to boost military readiness, benefit service members, and help protect our national security – not write a blank check to the Trump administration to wreak any havoc they please. But that’s exactly what the NDAA does, which is why I could not vote in good conscience to advance this bill,” said Rep. Huffman.

“This year’s NDAA opens the door for Trump and his sycophants to strip away civil rights, act without congressional oversight, and create even more of a mess of our immigration system. The NDAA continues to allow the Trump admin to hand over our public lands to Border Patrol agents and rewrites key environmental safeguards, clearing the way for them to push their inhumane agenda with virtually no oversight.

“Because of this bill, our brave service members will be completely abandoned and treated with zero humanity. Now, they can be discriminated against based on their race or identity. Republicans are not only making it harder for diverse Americans to serve our country, but they’re also throwing a wrench in military readiness and recruitment in the process.

“While ultimately I could not vote to support their political culture wars, damage to our military, and relentless environmental attacks, I was happy we could negotiate to get federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina—it's been a long time coming and an important step forward in our work to support tribal sovereignty.

“But at the end of the day, this legislation does way more harm than good, and I can’t support something that enables Trump to do any and everything he wants, no matter the cost to our service members, public lands, or innocent people around the world,” he concluded.

Some of the harmful provisions Huffman opposed in the final passage of the NDAA include:

Gives a Blank Check to Trump with Minimal Constraints: The FY26 NDAA doesn’t force any truly meaningful oversight or restraints on Trump, despite severe overreaches and abuses of power that have become a hallmark of this administration. While it has minor provisions to fence funding until the Secretary of Defense provides Congress unedited videos of strikes in Latin America, require explanations for removals of general offices, and more transparency on the use of military aircraft for immigration enforcement, the efforts stop there and completely fail to meet the serious overreaches by the Trump administration.

Clears the way for Trump’s Abuse of Public Lands: Expands the Department of Defense (DoD)’s authority to support Border Patrol operations, enabling the administration to further militarize and weaponize public lands for its oppressive border-enforcement agenda.

Fuels Discrimination: Prohibits the DoD from offering any DEI-related training programs and developing any reports on topics that are related, or perceived to be related to, DEI. The bill also prohibits transgender athletes enrolled at the military services academies from competing in women’s sports.

Supports the White Christian Nationalism Agenda: Excludes provision protecting collective bargaining rights for the DoD’s civilian employees. It also excludes a provision addressing the renaming of military installations and bases after Confederates.

Locks in Trump’s Extreme Border Agenda: Codifies the administration’s self-declared border “emergency” declaration, granting expanded authority to escalate the militarization at the southern border.

Denies IVF access to military families: Excludes a provision that would have extended fertility-treatment coverage to all service members.

“Congress needs to step in and hold the Trump Administration accountable for mishandling billions of taxpayer dollars.” “When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price.
Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.
“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer.
The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies.","Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative John Garamendi (D-Calif.) released a new report detailing the Trump administration’s diversion of funds and resources from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement, and its impact on readiness and morale.

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) co-authored the report.

Under a second Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement. Senator Warren’s new report, the first detailed review of the Pentagon’s spending on immigration, found that DoD has committed at least $2 billion to support immigration enforcement through mobilizing and deploying troops to American cities and the Southern border, deporting and transporting immigrants on military aircrafts, detaining individuals on U.S. military installations, and more.

“It’s an insult to our service members that Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts. Stripping military resources to promote a wasteful political agenda doesn’t make our military stronger or Americans safer,” said Senator Warren. “Congress needs to step in and hold the Trump Administration accountable for mishandling billions of taxpayer dollars.”

“When President Trump recklessly diverts our military to support immigration enforcement, our armed forces pay the price. As this report shows, these disruptions come at a significant cost, in both dollars and readiness,” said Representative Garamendi.

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts in support of DHS with money allocated for other DoD projects including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” said the members.

The members’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” wrote the members. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was “understaffed because roughly half its members [were] deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse among service members, and may have even contributed to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

The report also slammed the administration’s failure to adequately inform Congress and the public about the diversion of funds. “The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” said the members.

The coalition directed follow-up questions to Secretary Hegseth about the number of troops currently supporting immigration enforcement, how long military units will be supporting DHS, and whether DHS will reimburse the military.

On Thursday, December 11, 2025, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on deployment of the National Guard across the United States.

December 10, 2025

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation on Tuesday terminated senior management of its economic development corporation after a tribal subsidiary secured a $29.9 million federal contract to design potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

The prime contract, awarded by the Department of Homeland Security to KPB Services LLC, supports early-phase planning, including research, technical assessments and concept designs for secure structures that meet ICE operating requirements. The award does not involve construction or the operation of detention centers, according to federal procurement documents.

In a joint statement, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Prairie Band LLC acknowledged community concerns about the Homeland Security contract and the process that led to its approval.

“Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Prairie Band LLC understand the concerns raised about a recently awarded Department of Homeland Security planning contract that involves feasibility studies and technical assessments,” the statement said. “As a sovereign Nation, our values guide the decisions we make, and we acknowledge that this contract does not align with those principles.”

The Tribal Council and the board of Prairie Band LLC said they terminated senior members of the LLC’s leadership team responsible for securing the award.

“Moving forward, we are also taking a closer look at the internal review and approval process for federal contracts,” the statement said, adding that new safeguards and reporting requirements will be implemented to prevent similar issues.

“We recognize the weight this news carries for so many, as well as the feelings of anger, confusion and disappointment it caused. We hear those concerns,” the Nation said. “As a Nation, we take seriously our responsibility to ensure all future engagements align clearly with our values and mission.”

KPB Services was registered in April by Prairie Band LLC Executive Vice President Ernest Woodward as part of the corporation’s broader strategy to enter federal procurement markets. The firm had positioned itself to pursue planning and technical support contracts across multiple agencies, though the specific ICE-related work drew immediate backlash from tribal citizens once details became public.

The Prairie Band contract reflects a broader pattern of Native entities securing federal immigration work. Alaska Native Corporations have held hundreds of millions of dollars in ICE contracts over the past decade, including detention facility operations, guard services and border patrol support.

NANA Regional Corporation, one of Alaska's largest Alaska Native Corporations, has faced criticism over its growing role in immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration. Other Alaska Native Corporations, including subsidiaries of Bering Straits Native Corporation and Ahtna Inc., have operated ICE detention facilities in Texas and California. Doyon Ltd. previously held Homeland Security contracts but exited that work about a decade ago.

Prairie Band LLC, wholly owned by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, oversees businesses in construction, professional services and government contracting. The $29.9 million award is among the largest federal contracts received by a Prairie Band enterprise and reflects a growing tribal presence in sectors historically dominated by private firms.

Tribal officials said revenue from federal contracts supports government programs, economic development and long-term financial growth for the Nation, but emphasized that future opportunities must advance — not conflict with — the Nation’s core values.

Brian Edwards provided additional reporting.

About a dozen foreign-born students at Vermont State University in Castleton took turns reading passages from an essay about the rise of online shopping.

Eighteen-year-old Heidi Perez focused intently on a printed copy she held with both hands, impressing her professor with her crisp elocution as she read aloud about statistical shifts in consumer behavior.

The first-year students were learning English as a second language as part of their college coursework. The daughter of migrant farmworkers from Chiapas, Mexico, Perez’s path to that classroom had been more circuitous than that of most of her peers.

On June 14, agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection smashed the window of a vehicle Perez was traveling in, arresting her and her stepfather. They were in Richford, delivering food to the homes of migrant farmworkers.

The young woman who’d graduated from Milton High School a few days prior would spend the next four weeks in a cell at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington.

Hundreds of Vermonters rallied for their release outside a federal court building in Burlington in July. A few days later, an immigration judge granted them bond, freeing Perez to become the first person in her family to attend college, even as the case against her is still pending.

She’s experienced the first-year jitters that most new college students contend with.

“I’m used to living with my family, and it’s all pretty new. When I got here I felt a little confused, a little out of place,” said Perez, who spoke to Vermont Public through an interpreter.

But she’s had to manage an additional stress that other students do not.

“Before the detention happened I felt really safe here. I hadn’t heard about many detentions,” Perez said. “After the detention, obviously things changed for the worse.”

'On a knife's edge'

Perez came to Vermont from Chiapas in 2022 when she was 15 years old to reunite with her mom, who had arrived five years earlier to work on a dairy farm. She’s part of a recent trend that’s seen more and more child immigrants travel to Vermont to join their parents.

No state or federal agency keeps reliable data on the number of undocumented children in Vermont. The advocacy organization Migrant Justice says the number of children of undocumented Latin American immigrants is probably somewhere in the high hundreds.

As federal immigration authorities arrest an unprecedented number of people in Vermont — more than 100 over the past 10 months — that has altered the daily reality not just for parents but for the children that followed them here.

Yesenia is a single mom from Tabasco, Mexico, who moved to Vermont in 2017 so she could better provide for her two kids back home. Vermont Public is using only her first name because her immigration status puts her at risk of deportation.

“There wasn’t a way to make ends meet, and they needed things,” she said through an interpreter. “So this was the way to make enough money that I would be able to send back so they would have the things they needed.”

About three years ago, her children, now 14 and 18, traveled to Vermont to be with her. The family lives in a small house near the dairy farm where Yesenia feeds calves, and they attend local public schools. Yesenia’s daughter has been accepted into an architecture program at Norwich University.

But the heightened threat of deportation has cast a shadow over their new lives here.

“We just sort of feel like we’re on a knife’s edge right now, and that anything could happen,” Yesenia said. “We talk about what it would be like to go back to Mexico, but it’s not like things are going so great there. And if they want an education, I mean, here’s the place to do it. Like, I don’t think that they would be able to have the same future in Mexico that they could have here.”

Pushing for change

The fact that such a future, however tenuous, exists in Vermont can be traced to the efforts of immigrant workers themselves, including Heidi Perez.

Last year she traveled to the Statehouse multiple times to urge lawmakers to make residents of Vermont eligible for in-state tuition rates, and need-based financial aid, regardless of their immigration status.

“I explained why education is so important, why I wanted to study, why that opportunity meant so much,” Perez said. “And we just kept coming back again and again and talking to the legislators and eventually we won.”

She’s acutely aware of the significance of what that achievement means for her community.

“Before, young people would come here only to work. Why? Because they didn’t know they could study here in Vermont,” Perez said over breakfast at the Castleton cafeteria. “But now, because as a community we organized and we won the right to education, now we know we can do that.”

But whether Perez herself will be able to take advantage of the education she fought for now hinges on the outcome of her pending immigration case. While a judge granted Perez bond, federal authorities are still pursuing their case against her.

She’s accused of a civil immigration offense. For that, the federal government wants her deported from the United States. ■",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9048d49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F38%2Fc139fa7549e385ff311e6f5a596a%2Fimmigrant-workers-heidi3-palumbo-20251114-11.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:57:24.968275

“The Pentagon is able to execute on many missions at the same time,” said Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
According to the report, the Pentagon expects to account for border operations in its next budget, instead of taking funds from other projects authorized by Congress.
The Defense Department’s spending on immigration operations is set to more than double next year, to $5 billion.","A group of Democratic lawmakers said in a report released on Wednesday that the Pentagon had diverted at least $2 billion from its core missions this year to support the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The report found that shifting the funds had led to the pausing or canceling of programs, including the building of a pilot training facility, the repairing of schools for children of service members and the refurbishment of military barracks, something Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called a priority.

The report says that military readiness “will suffer as a direct result of diverting” Pentagon resources for immigration missions that are “not consistent” with the military’s mission and that troops “have neither signed up nor been trained for.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the administration was “using the defense budget as a slush fund for political stunts.”

The report cited as an example funds that had been allocated for building a jet-aircraft training facility in Mississippi and barracks for troops on overseas bases. The money was “reprogrammed” to build just 20 miles of President Trump’s wall along the southern border, lawmakers said.

The Defense Department defended its use of resources to back Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, saying in a statement that it could do so without undercutting other priorities. The military budget is nearly $900 billion a year.

“The Pentagon is able to execute on many missions at the same time,” said Kingsley Wilson, a Pentagon spokeswoman.

She added: “Spending allocated money on one mission does not mean other missions become depleted.”

It is unclear, the report says, whether the Department of Homeland Security has reimbursed the Defense Department for any of the military’s spending on immigration operations.

Earlier this year, Congress provided Mr. Trump with $170 billion over four years, mostly for the Department of Homeland Security, to back his immigration policies. In the process, the annual budget of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, jumped from $8 billion to approximately $28 billion, making it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Using military assets for immigration missions, including housing migrants in detention and using Air Force cargo aircraft for deportation flights, has proved more costly than when the same functions are performed by civil authorities, the report said.

The report, citing a deportation flight from El Paso, Texas, to Guatemala shortly after Mr. Trump took office in January, found that the use of military aircraft costs taxpayers approximately three times more than flights made by civilian aircraft chartered by ICE.

In February, the administration began using the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to house migrants designated for deportation from the United States — but only intermittently.

The effects of federalizing National Guard soldiers and airmen and sending them on missions directed by the White House has had a negative effect on the ability of state governors to perform emergency services closer to home, the report said.

Lawmakers noted that in June, the California National Guard’s firefighting unit only had half of its assigned soldiers ahead of peak wildfire season, after the president sent many of its members to Los Angeles to assist ICE.

According to the report, the Pentagon expects to account for border operations in its next budget, instead of taking funds from other projects authorized by Congress. The Defense Department’s spending on immigration operations is set to more than double next year, to $5 billion.

The exact number of American troops deployed to the southern border is unclear, but is likely at least 8,500. U.S. Northern Command, which oversees that mission, has said that active-duty forces will remain at the border “until complete operational control of the southern border is achieved.”

Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.

The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.

Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn’t previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.

“This is a big win for the rule of law,” Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. “Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.”

The lawsuit is one piece of Kobach’s broad range of anti-immigration efforts. He helped Kansas earlier this year become one of the first states in the country to deputize state law enforcement agents to enforce immigration law.

He is party to another lawsuit that seeks to exclude certain immigrants from U.S. Census counts. Kobach argued counting people in the country without particular documentation or with temporary visas skews congressional district apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of “the whole number of persons in each state” every 10 years.

He also spent years defending anti-immigration ordinances on behalf of cities, and, as a law professor, he helped craft controversial legislation in Arizona.

Far-right parties which focus on anti-immigrant messaging are gaining popularity in many EU countries, with centrist forces trying to claw back votes.","If you read Washington's latest security strategy slamming European migration policies and claiming the continent faces ""civilisational erasure,"" you might think the EU was throwing its borders wide open.

In fact, irregular migration to the bloc is falling, and EU states just advanced their most restrictive migration rules yet in a bid to make it easier for members to swiftly detain and deport rejected asylum seekers.

Denmark's Immigration Minister Rasmus Stoklund said new reforms would help fix a ""dysfunctional"" EU system and restore a sense of ""control.""

But the moves have also drawn stark criticism from human rights watchdogs, with Amnesty accusing the bloc of mirroring the ""harrowing, dehumanizing and unlawful mass arrests, detention and deportations in the US.""

Sending migrants to overseas detention centers?

The raft of reforms backed by EU home affairs ministers on Monday includes a legal rubber-stamp on the idea of so-called ""return hubs."" That could mean detention centers outside the EU where migrants may be sent to have asylum claims processed — or even as part of a one-way ticket out from Europe.

The rule rewrite, which still needs to be negotiated with the European Parliament, would allow individual EU governments to strike up deals with states beyond the bloc's borders and send migrants there — even if they have no ties to the country.

While Denmark began mulling ways to send migrants to Rwanda back in 2021, the first EU member to try it out in practice was Italy. It set up centers in its non-EU neighbor Albania last year, but Rome's hubs were beset by legal challenges and put on hold.

Italy's interior minister said on Monday that agreement among ministers leaves Albania-based centers well-positioned to become the first real-world example of an EU return hub and to ""resume"" operations.

But migration policy analyst Helena Hahn said the ""jury is still out"" on what return hubs could look like beyond Italy's model — and above all, which non-EU states would be willing to host migrants bound for Europe.

'Shirking responsibility?'

Charities and campaigners including Human Rights Watch and Oxfam have in the past slammed the EU for ""shirking responsibility"" by trying to outsource asylum processing.

""The EU is attempting to further push its responsibilities onto countries who already host the majority of refugees with often far fewer resources,"" dozens of NGOs said last year.

Their statement insisted EU pledges to uphold migrants' rights were ""empty words.""

Denmark's Stoklund pushed back on those accusations on Monday. ""If we send someone to a return center, we will be responsible for respecting their human rights,"" he told reporters after talks in Brussels.

Faster deportations by designating 'safe' countries

EU states also backed new proposals designed to speed up deportations, with harsher penalties for migrants who ignore expulsion orders. That follows an earlier agreement on EU plans to downgrade trade ties with countries which fail to cooperate on deportations.

Ministers also gave a green light to a centralized list of ""safe"" countries which national authorities can use to fast-track decisions and deny residency to those least likely to be granted asylum.

Only around 4% of Bangladeshis seeking asylum in the EU last year were accepted, for example, and Bangladesh heads up the list of countries deemed safe by Brussels. Other states on the list include India, Colombia, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.

Ministers agreed EU candidate states such as Montenegro, Moldova or Serbia should also be deemed safe, except in cases of conflict or restrictions on fundamental rights.

Relocate migrants or pay for support

EU states finalized one plan that analyst Helena Hahn sees as somewhat bucking the trend toward more restrictions.

The so-called ""solidarity pool"" will see member states from Europe's North and East either take in more migrants from Southern states where most asylum seekers arrive — or pay into a funding pot to support the likes of Cyprus, Spain, Italy or Greece.

Hahn describes this as ""a mechanism to organize and to coordinate responsibility sharing over asylum seekers amongst member states"" — and she thinks it's a ""big step.""

""Questions around relocations, quotas, the distribution of asylum seekers across Europe in a 'fair' way has always been — for the longest amount of time now — one of the main political sensitivities, in particular, that have plagued the implementation and functioning of the common European asylum system,"" she explained.

Details of which countries will pay what remain under wraps, but EU member Hungary has already vowed not to follow the rules — something which could tee up future legal clashes between Brussels and Budapest.

Voter concerns and a surging far right

EU citizens often cite irregular immigration as one of their top concerns. Bloc-wide survey data from earlier this year saw people rank it second only to Russia's war in Ukraine in a list of the biggest challenges facing the EU — ahead of the cost of living, climate change, and security and defense issues.

Far-right parties which focus on anti-immigrant messaging are gaining popularity in many EU countries, with centrist forces trying to claw back votes.

""We are looking at a largely restrictive immigration agenda,"" researcher Helena Hahn told DW, noting more and more countries are trying to come up with so-called ""innovative solutions"" to deter, detain and deport migrants.

""But we have seen very few outcomes so far,"" Hahn explained. ""So that also, I think, speaks to the political feasibility of some of these ideas that seem to suggest that it would be quite easy to move people from A to B, without any particular kind of respect to political, diplomatic or practical considerations.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep Judy Chu (CA-28), Senator Mazie Hirono (HI) reintroduced the Reuniting Families Act of 2025. This legislation would strengthen protections for immigrant families and address long-standing problems in a family immigration system that hasn’t seen meaningful reform in more than three decades.

Today, nearly four million people with approved visa applications remain trapped in a massive immigration backlog, with many waiting more than a decade to reunite with their loved ones. This crisis is the direct result of an outdated system that has not seen meaningful reform for more than thirty years. The Reuniting Families Act tackles these delays by recapturing unused visas, rolling them into future years, expanding who qualifies as a family member to include permanent partners, and increasing both the total number of available family preference visas and per-country limits.

The individuals stuck in these backlogs have approved applications and are ready to contribute to our communities and strengthen the American economy. No one, regardless of where they come from, should be forced to wait decades to reunite with family or begin building a life in the United States. We need a system that is safer, more efficient, and better equipped to uphold both America’s security and its commitment to humanity.

This bill tackles several major challenges within the immigration system. Among the key improvements are:

More than doubling number of available family preference visas

Raising existing per-country yearly visa limits, so the wait is not so long for countries with high levels of migration

Setting an absolute time limit on visa processing, so no applicant has to wait more than 10 years for a visa if they have an approved application

""Family-based immigration makes our country stronger. But our broken immigration system is preventing individuals from reuniting with their loved ones and contributing to our communities and economies. With over four million individuals with approved visa applications stuck in limbo through no fault of their own, families are needlessly suffering,” said Rep. Chu. “That’s why I am proud to reintroduce the commonsense Reuniting Families Act of 2025 with Senator Hirono to ensure that no one should have to wait years, sometimes decades, to reunite with a loved one and to ensure our family-based immigration system works more efficiently and humanely.”

“Immigrant families currently experience unnecessary obstacles and delays due to our country’s broken immigration system, keeping families separated for potentially long periods of time,” said Senator Hirono. “By reducing family-based immigration backlogs and making common sense updates to how we treat families, the Reuniting Families Act will help take the first step in the right direction to keeping families together as they navigate our immigration system.”

“Asian Americans Advancing Justice is proud to support Rep. Judy Chu’s reintroduction of the Reuniting Families Act (RFA), which will make it easier for immigrant families to reunite through a family-based immigration system. Family-based immigration has been the cornerstone of the United States for decades, laying the foundation for immigrant communities, including Asian Americans, to settle down and contribute to our nation’s vibrant social and economic fabric,” said Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a network of four independent Asian American civil rights organizations. “However, our immigration system has broken down without a fix for over thirty years, keeping families separated with millions of people stuck in backlogs abroad. Families have the right to be together and should not have to spend decades apart. This bill is a beacon of hope to make our immigration system more humane, and it is a meaningful step toward bringing loved ones back together.”

""Fifty years ago, millions of Southeast Asian families were forced to flee war and genocide in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, separated from their loved ones in order to survive. Today, our backlogged family immigration system continues to keep Southeast Asian American families apart, and that backlog has only continued to grow for our communities as this Administration prevents immigration from Laos,” said Quyen Dinh, Executive Director of the Southeast Asian Resource Action Center (SEARAC). “The Reuniting Families Act (RFA) restores compassion to our immigration system by preventing families from waiting decades to reunite and expanding relief for those facing deportation. As families across the country continue to be torn apart by this administration’s cruel immigration enforcement policies, we applaud Rep. Judy Chu for her leadership and commitment to keeping families whole. SEARAC is committed to working alongside Rep. Chu and our partners to ensure all families have the opportunity to reunite with their loved ones and heal.”

""In a time when immigrant families are facing unprecedented levels of cruelty and family separation, we urgently need legislation like the Reuniting Families Act (RFA) to reform our inefficient and inhumane immigration system,"" said Angelica Salas, Executive Director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA). ""For decades, we have endured the repercussions of this broken immigration system, which includes a significant backlog of family visas. CHIRLA welcomes the RFA, as it recognizes that family unity lies at the core of our immigration system and that immigrants are human beings who contribute to and strengthen our nation.""

""The Reuniting Families Act (RFA) directly addresses the needs of our communities by ensuring that family members are not subjected to extensive and often distressing visa processing delays,” said Nils Kinuani, Federal Policy Manager of African Communities Together (ACT). “By streamlining the family-based immigration system, this bill facilitates the quicker reunification of families, which is vital for both the individuals involved and the broader community.""

Mirsy Alva-Lopez came to the United States in 2018 from Guatemala because she wanted to give her children a dignified and safe future. So you can imagine her horror when she was detained at the U.S.-Mexico border, where immigration officials tore her apart from her 3-year-old son and placed him in government custody.

Mirsy grappled with the constant fear, trauma, and heartbreak of having limited knowledge about her son’s whereabouts or well-being. They were one of many thousands of families separated under the first Trump administration’s unconscionable Zero Tolerance policy.

ICE class action lawsuit filed on behalf of separated families like Mirsy’s was settled, Mirsy won the right to apply for certain types of immigration status so she and her children could remain in the United States, safe and reunited.

This past summer, however, Mirsy was caught in the second Trump administration’s interior enforcement dragnet while going to work in Florida. Even after presenting documentation of her lawful status, Mirsy was detained by ICE agents. In less than a week, she was illegally deported to Guatemala. Once again, Mirsy was separated from her children and forced to relive the worst moment of her life.

Because she could not bear to be separated from her children again, Mirsy arranged for them to say goodbye to their friends and school community in the United States and travel to Guatemala to be with her. But her children had not lived there in seven years—Guatemala didn’t feel like home.

That’s why the Young Center and partner organizations advocated for Mirsy and her children to be able to return to the United States. Though the government agreed to allow them to return, it has been slow to act and over five months have passed since Mirsy was deported.

In the years after their initial separation, Mirsy’s son often expressed fear that his mother would be taken from him or that she wouldn’t return. Under the current administration, that fear became a reality.

Every family deserves safety, belonging, and hope. This Human Rights Day—and every day—we stand with immigrant families, like Mirsy’s. Help us raise our voices for justice.

While the document is mainly concerned with the United States’ international posture and defensive capabilities, it also addressed the significance of strong borders, emphasizing the connection between border security and national security. FAIR has been proud to support the administration’s pro-enforcement agenda and encourages further action to safeguard our borders and enforce our laws.

In declaring an end to the “Era of Mass Migration,” the White House paper uncompromisingly lays out the importance of strong borders to national sovereignty:

In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion, distorted labor markets, and undermined national security. The era of mass migration must end. Border security is the primary element of national security. We must protect our country from invasion, not just from unchecked migration but from cross-border threats such as terrorism, drugs, espionage, and human trafficking. A border controlled by the will of the American people as implemented by their government is fundamental to the survival of the United States as a sovereign republic.

The administration has achieved rapid success in shutting down illegal crossings and quickly ramping up removals, reversing four years of disastrous anti-borders policies. Congress has supported this agenda by passing a FAIR-supported reconciliation bill containing billions of dollars for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for border security and immigration enforcement. In contrast, under the Biden administration’s failed policies, violent criminals and transnational gang members flooded American communities and more than 10 million illegal aliens crossed our borders, including nearly two million special interest aliens potentially posing national security threats.

Beyond the broad effects, as FAIR demonstrated in a recent report, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also took advantage of the Biden administration’s border crisis. Over 182,000 Chinese nationals were encountered at the border from Fiscal Years (FY) 2021 to 2024, many of whom were economic migrants relying on fraudulent asylum applications to gain entry, as well as spies and nationals with links to the CCP. China’s government has also encouraged the production and export of fentanyl precursor chemicals to Mexico, fueling drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.

FAIR looks forward to continuing work with the Trump administration and Congress to enact policies like those outlined in the 2025 National Security Strategy to roll back the failed policies of the previous administration, secure the nation’s borders, and defend its sovereignty.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Trump-at-border-Trump-White-House-Archive-FLICKR.jpg.webp?itok=oSV3N-DF,N,,2025-12-10 16:57:09.665506

The facility has become a “human and civil rights catastrophe,” the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations said in the letter sent Monday to ICE and Fort Bliss officials. The organizations are calling for the camp to be shut down, alleging detained immigrants are subject to beatings and sexual abuse by officers, as well as medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of access to attorneys.

A number of detainees suffered serious injuries due to these physical abuses, the report alleges, and in one reported case a detained teenager said he lost consciousness and required hospitalization after being slammed to the ground.

“Officers have engaged in a widespread and unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force,” the organizations said in a news release.

Neither the U.S. Department of Homeland Security nor Fort Bliss immediately responded to El Paso Matters’ request for comment. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post that “no detainees are being beaten or abused” and that all people being deported to third countries are given due process protections.

The 19-page letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, ACLU said in the news release. They’re calling for a thorough investigation into all the alleged abuses.

Other organizations that signed the letter include the ACLU of New Mexico, the ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and the Texas Civil Rights Project.

“We can’t stay silent about what is happening at Camp East Montana. After speaking with dozens of detained immigrants, the reports are clear: abuse, neglect, and unsafe living conditions are widespread,” Estrella del Paso, a nonprofit organization of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, posted on Instagram, demanding “immediate action and accountability.”

Third-country removals

The groups are calling for President Donald Trump’s administration to halt all third-country removals from Fort Bliss, such as deportations to Mexico of non-Mexican immigrants, until procedural safeguards are in place.

According to the ACLU report, ICE officers reportedly handcuffed non-Mexican detainees at Camp East Montana, loaded them onto vans and transported them over an hour away to the U.S.-Mexico border near Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Masked officers then allegedly instructed detainees to “jump” into Mexico to be deported.

The alleged efforts to force people into Mexico would not comply with U.S. and international laws on third-country deportations, which require the consent of the third country and promises not to subject those being returned to persecution or abuse.

In one sworn declaration, a Cuban immigrant held at the Fort Bliss facility said officers handcuffed him and about 20 others, placed them on a bus and drove them to the border. There, they were told to get off the bus and cross into Mexico.

“If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa,” Isaac, a pseudonym used to protect his identity, said in his declaration. He told lawyers that guards hit him, slammed him against the wall about 10 times and grabbed and crushed his testicles.

Detainees who refused to cross into Mexico say they were threatened with criminal charges, long-term imprisonment or violence, the report states, citing similar claims by other Cuban immigrants.

It’s not clear from the detainees’ statements provided by the ACLU whether any migrants crossed into Mexico under the conditions described. Some of the collected affidavits state those who signed what “appeared” to be voluntary deportation papers were separated from those who refused to sign and not seen from again.

Third-country deportation refers to the U.S. sending someone to a country that is neither their home country nor a country of their citizenship.

Historically rare and based on individual cases, the practice expanded sharply under the second Trump administration as a tool to remove or intimidate immigrants who could not legally be returned to their home countries due to risks of persecution, according to the American Immigration Council.

These actions, including transfers to places where people faced imprisonment or danger, raise serious concerns about compliance with U.S. laws prohibiting deportation to countries where individuals may be persecuted or tortured, the nonprofit organization that advocates for immigration justice said.

The U.S. Supreme Court in June temporarily upheld the Trump administration’s third-country deportation policies, blocking a lower court’s order that required 15 days notice. The Supreme Court’s ruling is pending the outcome of an appeal to the lower court, expected to be heard in federal court in Massachusetts this month, the Washington Post reported. In July, ICE instructed agency personnel they could remove people to third countries with six hours notice.

The ACLU alleges detention officers threatening immigrants to cross into Mexico runs counter to the protocols governing third-country deportations — including ICE’s own guidance following the court rulings.

Medical neglect, other allegations

Other allegations in the ACLU report include:

Medical neglect: Detainees report delayed or denied medical, dental and mental health care, including failure to administer prescription medication on time or at all, despite serious chronic conditions.

Food and hygiene: Conditions are described as substandard and unsanitary. Detainees report insufficient food portions, spoiled or inedible meals, lack of adequate hygiene supplies such as soap and clean clothes, and unsanitary sleeping and living spaces.

Restricted access to legal counsel: Access to attorneys and legal resources are severely restricted or effectively denied: the facility reportedly lacks a functioning law library, detainees have limited or non-private phone access, and legal visits are often blocked or delayed.

Limited access to recreation: Detainees report extremely limited access to outdoor recreation or fresh air; many say they have gone weeks or months without seeing the sky or being allowed outside, violating standards for detainee well-being.

The detained teenager, who uses Samuel as a pseudonym for his safety, told attorneys he was beaten by officers, sustained injuries across his body and broke his front tooth after being slammed to the ground.

Samuel attested one officer ”grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” He said he felt dizzy and fought to remain conscious while an officer laughed at him for having a chipped tooth and said Samuel was “like a little girl,” the report states. Samuel lost consciousness and was transported to a hospital by ambulance.

Continued allegations of abuse at Camp East Montana

Camp East Montana opened in August in what was an active construction site and now holds more than 2,700 men and women — part of a militarized expansion of immigration detention under the Trump administration. The Washington Post in September reported the facility violated more than 60 federal detention standards within its first 50 days, citing a leaked internal ICE inspection report.

DHS called the report “false and misleading,” with McLaughlin in a statement saying any claims of inhumane conditions at ICE detention centers “categorically false.” The statement said all detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment and are provided opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family members.

The $1.2 billion facility — expected to grow to about 5,000 detainees to become the country’s largest federal detention center for civil detainees — is funded by the Department of Defense under the reconciliation bill. The Big Beautiful Bill provided $45 billion in supplemental funding to double migrant detention capacity nationwide to 100,000 beds.

In a November letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons, Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar called the conditions at Camp East Montana “dangerous and inhumane.”

“They have been since the facility opened at the beginning of August (when it was still an active construction site), and only seem to be deteriorating,” the El Paso congresswoman wrote. “It is increasingly clear that it is not a safe nor professionally managed facility.”

She said staff are unable to maintain accurate population counts, and pressed for answers about staffing, vendor changes and protocols.

Escobar said people held at Camp East Montana continue to face unsafe and unhealthy conditions, including foul-tasting drinking water, poor-quality food and inconsistent laundry services that force some detainees to wash clothes in showers. She also cited unsanitary dorms and flooding and sewage backups.

On Saturday, ICE agents in an unmarked car followed Jesus Saucedo-Portillo into a parking lot on the Minneapolis campus and attempted to detain him. Campus security and residence hall officials observed the situation and tried to intervene. Soon, more agents arrived, “pointing weapons at the crowd and pushing witnesses back” as students began recording the incident, according to a campuswide email Provost Paula O’Loughlin wrote Saturday evening: “I want to emphasize that the staff and other Augsburg community members who were present followed our protocols.”

According to the university, when a senior administrator asked to see a judicial warrant, agents said they didn’t have one and eventually arrested Saucedo-Portillo. “It was done on private property, without a warrant,” Paul Pribbenow, president of the university, told the Star Tribune. “From our perspective, that is illegal.”

A judicial warrant signed by a federal judge is required for officers to enter private property or detain someone there, according to the National Immigration Law Center. ICE arrest warrants are typically signed by immigration officials and agents must get permission to enter private areas.

However, the Department of Homeland Security has since contested the university’s claims that ICE agents didn’t have an arrest warrant. In a statement Monday, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs for DHS, accused the university administrators on the scene of attempting “to obstruct the arrest.”

“Our officers told the school Administrator and campus security that ICE had a warrant for the illegal alien’s arrest. The school Administrator told ICE officers they were violating university policies. Our officers informed them that federal law supersedes any University policy and that if campus security would not stop blocking the law enforcement vehicle from exiting, they would be obstructing justice,” McLaughlin’s statement said. “The school administrator continued her efforts to block the vehicle from leaving and ordered campus security to stand in front of the vehicle. Our officers followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to clear the area and successfully arrested this criminal illegal alien.”

McLaughlin also claimed that Saucedo-Portillo “is a registered sex offender and has a previous arrest for driving while intoxicated.” However, a search of Minnesota court records returned no record of a DWI case, and his name is not listed in the national sex offender registry, according to the Star-Tribune.

The university says its “previous statements about the incident remain unchanged,” a university spokesperson, told the newspaper Tuesday. “When asked to provide a judicial warrant, the agents refused to produce and stated they did not have one, despite being on private property.”",https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2022-12/Augs.PNG?itok=gUsxN8_k,N,,2025-12-10 18:57:38.813843

Introduction

A single mother and her daughter from Cuba arrived in Mexico seeking safety. Under Mexican law, they should have received a Tarjeta de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias (TVRH), or Visitor’s Card for Humanitarian Reasons, the official document that grants asylum seekers temporary access to work, education, and basic services while their case is pending. Months passed, and the card never came. The mother was pushed into low-paid informal work, and her daughter was denied school enrollment for lack of Mexican identification, the very identification the TVRH would have provided.

With support from USCRI’s legal team in Tijuana, the family eventually obtained their cards through a court order. Most asylum seekers, however, do not. Across Mexico, thousands are being excluded from formal jobs, education, and essential services because the National Institute of Migration (INM) has effectively stopped issuing this critical document.

Mexico’s Evolving Regional Role in International Protection

Mexico, a longstanding transit country for asylum seekers, has become a destination for migrants across the Americas in recent years. In 2014, the country received 2,137 asylum applications. That number rose to more than 130,000 in 2021 and reached a record 140,000 in 2023. That year, amid record encounters at the U.S. southern border and pressure from the U.S. Government, Mexico intensified migration enforcement and restricted access to the TVRH. In practice, the INM suspended the issuance of the TVRH for most first-time applicants.

In 2024, the INM issued 97% fewer cards than the previous year. Nearly all cards now issued are renewals rather than first-time approvals, according to Diego Ramirez, a USCRI lawyer in Tijuana. The suspension has left thousands without identification or access to formal employment, education, and essential services, violating their human rights.

Despite increased enforcement, people continue to arrive and seek asylum in Mexico. The Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) received roughly 80,000 applications in 2024 and is on track for a similar number in 2025. UNHCR’s 2025 Protection Monitoring tool found that a growing share of the people arriving in Mexico fled violence or persecution in their country and that most identified Mexico, not the United States, as their intended destination.

As the United States restricts humanitarian entry, including through pausing asylum applications and the rollback of Temporary Protected Status for some nationalities (visit USCRI’s “Get the Latest” for more), many displaced people view Mexico as a viable option, at least temporarily. Yet, without the TVRH, they are deprived of rights guaranteed to them under the 2011 Migration Law of Mexico which places them at a greater risk of exclusion and exploitation.

What is the Visitor’s Card for Humanitarian Reasons (TVRH)?

Under Mexican migration law, the INM must issue a TVRH to foreign nationals in certain situations of vulnerability, including asylum seekers. The card grants one year of lawful stay, renewable until the asylum case concludes. It allows holders to travel within the country, obtain a Temporary Unique Population Registry Code (CURP), and access health, education, and formal employment. The card also protects them from deportation.

TVRH denial constitutes a violation of human rights and Mexican law

The INM’s refusal to issue the TVRH is both unlawful under Mexican law and violates asylum seekers’ human rights, including the rights to legal identity, work, education, and healthcare. Mexican law states that asylum seekers are entitled to receive the card while their case is pending. In practice, the INM has systematically ignored this obligation, leaving thousands in legal limbo. Denying the required document undermines these rights and puts Mexico at odds with its international treaty obligations and national law.

Since 2023, the INM has blocked new cards for most first-time applicants. The agency has continued to renew cards on a limited basis for those who already have them, but new applicants face near-total denials. When questioned, INM officials point to these few renewals as evidence of compliance, even though the agency is refusing to issue cards for first-time applicants.

To avoid denying the card, some INM offices issue a substitute document known as a constancia de trámite (proof of pending process), which merely states that a person has initiated a procedure and is not valid under Mexican law. The INM has no legal authority to issue it; it bears no official signature or seal and cannot be used as identification or for employment, banking, or access to public services. According to Ramirez, the document functions as a bureaucratic loophole: “It’s how INM washes its hands. They cannot legally refuse the card, so they give this instead.”

By withholding the card, the INM denies asylum seekers access to rights guaranteed under Mexican law, including formal employment, health care, and education. Although they are lawfully present in Mexico, the absence of documentation leaves them unprotected and exposed to the same obstacles faced by those without legal status. This violates their rights and contradicts Mexico’s own legal commitments under international human rights law. The denial of such documentation also erodes trust in the Mexican asylum system.

Obstacles faced by those without TVRH and their impact on integration and protection

For asylum seekers in Mexico, the TVRH is essential. Without it, they cannot work formally, certify their children’s schooling, obtain a driver’s license, or fully participate in the economy, including using the banking system. Nearly every interaction for asylum seekers requires the card for identification.

The most serious consequence is exclusion from the formal labor market. Employers hesitate to hire asylum seekers without a TVRH, despite their legal right to work. Because opening a bank account also requires the card, employers who pay via direct deposit have no way to compensate them. As a result, many work in the informal sector where exploitation is common and wages are lower, and where they are not covered by social security.

The economic effects are tangible. Gabriela Hernandez, director of Casa Tochan in Mexico City, described a young man who had lived independently for months and worked a steady job while he waited for his card. When the card did not arrive, his employer dismissed him, and he returned to the shelter in economic distress. In Tijuana, Diego Ramirez secured a TVRH for a client whose wife was pregnant and who received a job offer with a higher salary but could not accept it without the card. These cases highlight the necessity of the card in securing formal employment and illustrate how the card determines whether asylum seekers can achieve financial stability and self-sufficiency.

The lack of the card also disrupts access to education. To enroll in school, children must present a CURP, which is granted only with a TVRH. While some schools allow enrollment, they cannot certify completion without it, discouraging many parents from registering their children. The CURP is also required for public services such as healthcare, though hospitals must provide emergency treatment regardless of immigration status.

These barriers to employment and education hinder long-term integration. Adults face exploitation in the informal sector and economic uncertainty due to low wages, while children risk falling behind in school. Without the card’s protection from deportation, asylum seekers also face fines or extortion by authorities, even when they show proof of pending asylum applications.

Overview of legal appeals and rulings

As a result of the INM’s actions, lawyers across Mexico rely on the juicio de amparo as the only available remedy. Amparo is a constitutional mechanism that protects individuals from human rights violations committed by public authorities. Lawyers file amparos before federal judges, arguing the INM’s failure to issue the card constitutes unlawful omission. Because each ruling applies only to an individual petitioner, lawyers must file cases one by one. Achieving universal, class-wide relief through the courts is unlikely, given the legal and procedural constraints.

Applicants typically present their constancia de trámite and other evidence showing they have complied with all requirements. The INM, however, often ignores judicial orders and fails to respond until judges threaten sanctions. According to Ramirez, “There is zero openness to dialogue” on the part of the INM. Even with court rulings in favor of asylum seekers, compliance is delayed until the last possible moment.

Court orders have brought individual victories, such as the case described above in which a judge intervened to force the INM to grant a man a TVRH so he could accept a formal job offer while his wife was pregnant. Yet systemic relief remains difficult. Each amparo applies to only one person, even within the same family. Organizations have also sought recourse by filing complaints before the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH). Although the CNDH has issued recommendations, the INM dismisses them by pointing to renewal statistics as evidence that they are issuing the cards.

Cases can take up to a year to resolve, and even successful rulings do not correct pervasive and consistent institutional noncompliance. Despite efforts from lawyers and civil society, no substantive change has been achieved. As advocates note, the only strategy that forces action from the INM is sustained judicial pressure.

Beyond the humanitarian sector, the problem remains largely invisible. Few media outlets cover the suspension, and public awareness is minimal. Yet, for asylum seekers and legal advocates, it represents a crisis. The repercussions for those seeking asylum are significant and hard to fully measure.

Conclusion

The suspension of the Visitor’s Cards for Humanitarian Reasons reflects a troubling contradiction in Mexico’s asylum system. While the Government recognizes asylum seekers’ legal rights, it denies them the very document that allows them to exercise those rights. The amparo process offers individual relief but cannot replace the need for INM compliance with Mexican law. Restoring TVRH issuance is essential to uphold the rule of law, protect asylum seekers’ rights, and ensure Mexico’s commitment to humanitarian and human rights principles.

Recommendations:

For the Mexican government:

Reinstatement of TVRH issuance for all asylum seekers in accordance with Article 52 of the 2011 Migration Law of Mexico.

Notification and coordination among federal and local authorities to ensure all government agencies are aware of the suspension and instructed to exercise flexibility in verifying identity or status.

For local governments:

Adoption of local-level documentation initiatives by state and municipal governments to facilitate temporary identity or service cards to enable access to rights while federal procedures remain stalled. Mexico City’s Guest and Migrant Registry (Padrón de Huéspedes y Migrantes) is a model program. While it has low enrollment, it remains in effect and permits identification and access to services for migrants regardless of their migration status.

For civil society:

Promotion of public awareness and media engagement to bring national attention to the humanitarian impacts of the suspension, ensuring accountability and sustained pressure.

For the United States Government:

Expansion of U.S. support for protection-focused programs in Mexico that improve access to documentation and legal assistance for asylum seekers.

On Human Rights Day, and every day, we reaffirm that the rights of asylum seekers in Mexico are not privileges but legal obligations that the State must uphold. By refusing to issue the TVRH to thousands of people seeking protection, the INM denies them the ability to work, study, and live with dignity.

Without the reinstatement of TVRH issuance, Mexico not only violates the human rights of thousands of asylum seekers but also perpetuates their exclusion and leaves meaningful integration and protection into Mexican society out of reach.

Support USCRI’s Still Standing Campaign in Latin America and the Caribbean

USCRI’s legal work to secure Humanitarian Visitors Cards for asylum seekers is part of its Still Standing strategy, which aims to serve displaced people in Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador and focuses on four key priorities: protection, livelihoods, education and humanitarian assistance.

The president told the crowd gathered at a casino and resort in Mount Pocono that inflation was no longer a problem and that Democrats had used the term ""affordability"" as a ""hoax"" to hurt his reputation. But his remarks weaved wildly to include grievances he first raised behind closed doors in his first term in 2018 — and later denied saying — asking why the U.S. doesn't have more immigrants from Scandinavia.

""Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?"" Trump said onstage. ""Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few?""

Trump said he objected to taking immigrants from ""hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries."" He added for emphasis that those places ""are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.""

Tuesday's gathering in the swing state — and in a competitive House district — was an official White House event, yet it seemed more like one of his signature campaign rallies that his chief of staff said he would hold regularly ahead of next year's midterms. But instead of being in an arena that could draw several thousand attendees, it was held in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, a small town of about 3,000 residents.

Voters starting to blame lasting inflation on Republicans

Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

He displayed a chart comparing price increases under his predecessor, Joe Biden, to prices under his own watch to argue his case. But the overall inflation rate has climbed since he announced broad tariffs in April and left many Americans worried about their grocery, utility and housing bills.

""I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,"" Trump said. ""They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.""

As the president spoke, his party's political vulnerabilities were further seen as Miami voters chose Eileen Higgins to be their first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. Higgins defeated the Trump-endorsed Republican Emilio Gonzalez.

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally showed he could still appeal to the base, but it was unable to settle questions of whether he could hold together his 2024 coalition. Monroe County flipped to Trump last year after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.

As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.

In Monroe County, people agree that prices are a problem

But what seems undeniable — even to Trump supporters in Monroe County — is that inflation seems to be here to stay.

Lou Heddy, a retired maintenance mechanic who voted for Trump last year, said he's noticed in the past month alone that his and his wife's grocery bills have risen from $175 to $200, and he's not sure Trump can bring food prices down.

""Once the prices get up for food, they don't ever come back down. That's just the way I feel. I don't know how the hell he would do it,"" said Heddy, 72.

But Suzanne Vena, a Democratic voter, blames Trump's tariffs for making life more expensive, as she struggles with rising bills for food, rent and electricity on a fixed income. She remembers Trump saying that he would stop inflation.

""That's what we were originally told,"" said Vena, 66. ""Did I believe it? That's another question. I did not.""

The area Trump visited could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.

Trump held his rally in a congressional district held by first-term Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.

Speaking to the crowd before Trump, Bresnahan said the administration was working to lower costs, but voters ""aren't asking for partisan arguments — they're asking for results.""

It's not clear if Trump can motivate voters in Monroe County to show up in next year's election if they're worried about inflation.

Nick Riley, 38, said he's cutting back on luxuries, like going out to eat, as he absorbs higher bills for food and electricity and is having a hard time finding a good deal on a used car. Riley voted for Trump in 2020, but he sat out the 2024 election and plans to do so again next year.

""We're all broke. It doesn't matter whether you support Republicans or support Democrats,"" Riley said. ""We're all broke, and we're all feeling it.""

Trump to start holding more rallies before midterm elections

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show ""The Mom View"" that Trump would be on the campaign trail next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.

Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.

""We're actually going to turn that on its head,"" Wiles said, ""and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.""

The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying a historic boom.

Asked on a Politico podcast how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into grade inflation by answering ""A-plus,"" only to then amend his answer to ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

Trump says economy is strong, but Americans should buy fewer dolls

The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

So far, the public has been skeptical about Trump's economic performance. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

But Trump indicated that his tariffs and other policies were helping industries such as the steel sector. He said those industries mattered for the country as he then specifically told Americans that they should buy fewer pencils and dolls from overseas.

""You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,"" he told the crowd. ""Two or three is nice.""

Long Beach was recently recognized as one of the country’s top digital cities for its digital equity work and programming, something officials say is an effort that won’t lose steam in 2026 despite federal funding cuts.

The survey was from the national research and advisory institute, the Center for Digital Government, which focuses on policies and practices in state and local governments. Long Beach was among five cities nationwide to grab high marks in the Digital Cities Survey, which looks at how local governments use technology to address social challenges.

Lea Erikson, Long Beach’s director of technology, credited the recognition to the city’s approach to digital equity.

“We're not relying on federal funds to advance our work. And so even though it does definitely minimize what we can do, I'm really proud of what we have been able to do despite that,” Erikson said.

Why was Long Beach named?

Over the years, the coastal L.A. County city has grown into an epicenter for digital equity to grant more residents access to the internet.

According to the survey, the city advanced digital equity, among other things, through programs such as its “Pitch Long Beach!” — an initiative that allows the public to submit pitches on how to implement and explore technology as a way to improve city services.

Long Beach has also partnered with the California Emerging Technology Fund to launch a multilingual internet service enrollment hotline to help residents navigate telehealth, job searching and online learning.

“One of the things I think makes Long Beach a leader in this space is we have a dedicated staff to digital inclusion, and they're not dependent on federal funds, so they're actually funded by local government resources,” Erikson said.

Why are programs at risk?

In May, the Trump administration canceled the $2.75 billion Digital Equity Act, which the president called “racist” and “illegal.”

The cancellation put a stop to programs all over the country, including digital courses for seniors and laptop distributions in rural areas.

The Federal Communications Commission voted in September to end E-Rate discounts to libraries and schools for hotspot lending and school bus Wi-Fi. Officials said the initiatives “exceeded” or were “inconsistent” with the commission's authority. This decision effectively shut off funding for digital loaning programs.

Locally, the repercussions were felt instantly. Los Angeles County Library announced it would sunset its laptop and Wi-Fi hotspot lending programs shortly after the decision.

What are officials saying for 2026 and beyond?

Erikson said federal headwinds won’t stop the city’s digital equity work.

The city is working to create its own fiber-optic network by 2027 to offer free Wi-Fi in public places in an effort to save residents money and get them online.

“We're hoping to have that go out to bid … next year. We would hopefully have that done in about a two-year timeframe, so it might be a little delayed, but we have local funding for that as well,” Erikson said.

Los Angeles police officers used more than 1,000 less-lethal munitions and wounded six protesters on June 8, according to a state-mandated report released by the department.

The protests continued, along with the LAPD’s use of crowd control munitions, but the department has missed the deadline for several reports required by state law.

LAPD used less-lethal munitions for crowd control on at least four separate days in June — including the first “No Kings” protest on June 14 — and has not published reports on those incidents.

Court documents identify more than a dozen people who were struck by less-lethal munitions between June 9 and June 14. At least four were hospitalized for their injuries. The LAPD has posted video evidence of officers launching volleys of 40mm rounds and tear gas at protesters, but the only new report of crowd control weapons being used after June 8 is from an incident months later on Oct. 25.

The delay puts the LAPD in violation of Assembly Bill 48, a law that went into effect in 2022 to regulate the use of crowd control weapons like 40mm launchers, pepper balls and tear gas. All agencies that use those weapons for crowd control are required to follow up by reporting the reason the weapons were needed, how many were used and how many injuries they caused. The reports must be posted publicly to the agency’s website within 60 days in most cases, or 90 days if an extension is justified.

In a statement, the LAPD acknowledged that the department is “currently outside the 90-day public posting requirement,” saying the delay “stems from the extraordinary volume and complexity of incidents that occurred during that period.”

The department added that the forms will be posted to their website after internal review.

Hundreds of other California law enforcement agencies do not appear to follow AB 48’s reporting requirements, as LAist reported in September, reflecting what experts said was a lack of enforcement mechanism in the law.

In a statement to LAist, City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez called on the LAPD to produce the reports required by state law.

“As we face federal raids that brutalize our communities without transparency or accountability, the City of LA cannot mirror those same tactics,” the statement said. “We must act with moral clarity and protect our residents by fully complying with disclosure laws.”

Critical Incidents

The LAPD has released video evidence documenting three “critical incidents” in which people were sent to the hospital after less-lethal munitions were used against them.

State law requires law enforcement agencies to release any video recordings of incidents where either a firearm is discharged or use of force leads to serious injury or death. The LAPD posts these videos and written descriptions of the incidents on their website.

Two of the released videos show police officers shooting people in the head with 40mm rounds, though AB 48 bans aiming less-lethal rounds at the head, neck, or any other vital organs. The third shows a protester shot multiple times by less-lethal munitions before he was arrested and taken to the hospital for a fractured finger.

One video shows Marshall Woodruff, an L.A. photographer and filmmaker, get struck in both the arm and the face by less-lethal rounds as LAPD officers let loose dozens of rounds toward protesters on June 14.

In video and written descriptions of the incident, the LAPD claims the crowd began assaulting officers by throwing objects, including rocks and bottles, leading to the use of less-lethal munitions. In body camera footage made public by the department, it appears at least one object was thrown toward the officers from somewhere in the crowd.

Woodruff later told reporters he needed “four or five” hours of surgery to repair damage to his eye.

That same day, police officers shot Jack Kearns in the back of the head as he was running away. The department says in written and video descriptions of the incident that he broke through their skirmish line. Court records filed by the L.A. chapter of Black Lives Matter allege that Kearns was not noticed by police until he was nearly a block away and moving in the opposite direction.

Blood can be seen on the back of Kearns’ baseball cap in the video as he asks officers to call a medic.

Kearns told reporters in June that he suffered brain bleeding and was in the hospital for three days.

A few days earlier, on June 10, Daniel Robert Bill was shot multiple times by less-lethal munitions before he was arrested and taken to the hospital for a fractured finger.

In body camera video released by LAPD, Bill is seen standing still in front of an LAPD skirmish line when officers began to push him back with batons and opened fire with less-lethal launchers.

The police department has been accused of using less-lethal munitions against members of the media after June 8, including the use of a 40mm round that struck Australian reporter Lauren Tomasi on June 9.

A lawsuit by the L.A. Press Corps and news outlet Status Coup has identified 12 members of the media, including Tomasi, who are alleged to have been struck by less-lethal rounds from June 9 through June 14.

None of those incidents have been reported as required by AB 48.

Concerns about potential misuse

The L.A. City Council voted last week to continue allowing the LAPD to use 40mm less-lethal launchers and tear gas.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell argued in council chambers that such weapons are a ""de-escalation tool” that reduces the need of the department to use deadly force.

Some civil rights attorneys and other experts have told LAist they believe the LAPD’s use of less-lethal munitions against protesters has gone too far.

Adrienna Wong, a senior staff attorney with ACLU SoCal, told LAist in June that the indiscriminate use of force against protesters that month violated the law and the First Amendment rights of demonstrators.

“We have seen evidence that kinetic projectiles and chemical agents have been used indiscriminately, have injured people that have been protesting peacefully, are journalists or are in a crowd of people, and that seems to violate the express purpose of these laws,” Wong said.

Jeff Wenninger is a former LAPD lieutenant who led a unit that investigated all officer-involved shootings and use-of-force cases from 2013 until his retirement in 2024. He told LAist he thinks the LAPD has been too quick to use less-lethal munitions.

He pointed out that one of the two circumstances where less-lethal force is allowed is in response to a risk of serious bodily injury or death, which is the same as the requirement for lethal force.

The other allowed circumstance, according to AB 48, is to “bring an objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely and effectively under control.”

Wenninger said the law requires officers to have specific targets when using these weapons, rather than indiscriminately deploying them to disperse crowds.

“ A lot of the articulation and the justification for [less-lethal force] being used tends to suggest to me that law enforcement agencies don't actually really understand the law,” Wenninger told LAist.

Long-term pain

While they are called “less-lethal,” crowd control munitions can cause serious injury or death.

Martin Santoyo has filed a lawsuit against the LAPD for allegedly shooting him in the groin with a 40mm launcher from just feet away.

Santoyo has said in court documents that he was “lawfully exercising his First Amendment right to protest and posed no risk of harm to anyone.” Then, Santoyo claims, an officer intentionally shot him suddenly and without warning “from within several feet.”

He required emergency surgery on his testicles after he was shot, according to court documents, and he said he has endured months of “tremendous physical pain.”

Will Horowitz, a lawyer for Santoyo, told LAist his client needed a month of recovery before he was able to return to work.

The city of L.A. can also expect to feel some fiscal pain when lawsuits alleging misuse of these less-lethal munitions make their way through courtrooms and settlement negotiations.

Santoyo’s civil lawsuit includes accusations of negligence, assault, battery and violations of his constitutional rights. As cases like his mount, so will the potential liability payments that have already been rapidly increasing in recent years.

Employees at the U.S. Education Department who were fired in March got an unexpected email on Friday – telling them to return to work.

These federal workers, including many attorneys, investigate family complaints of discrimination in the nation's schools as part of the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). They were terminated by the Trump administration in a March reduction-in-force, but the courts intervened, temporarily blocking the department from completing their terminations.

That left 299 OCR employees, roughly half of its staff, in legal and professional limbo – because the department elected to place them on paid administrative leave while the legal battle plays out rather than allow them to work. Court records show 52 have since chosen to leave.

On Friday, an unknown number of the remaining 247 staffers received an email from the department. That email, which was shared with NPR by two people who received it, says that, while the Trump administration will continue its legal battle to downsize the department, ""utilizing all OCR employees, including those currently on administrative leave, will bolster and refocus efforts on enforcement activities in a way that serves and benefits parents, students, and families.""

Staff were instructed to report to their regional office on Monday, Dec. 15.

In a statement to NPR, Julie Hartman, the department's press secretary for legal affairs, confirmed that the department ""will temporarily bring back OCR staff.""

""The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force,"" Hartman wrote, ""but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers.""

The department did not clarify how many staffers it was recalling or why it was recalling them now, after keeping them on paid administrative leave for much of the year.

""By blocking OCR staff from doing their jobs, Department leadership allowed a massive backlog of civil rights complaints to grow, and now expects these same employees to clean up a crisis entirely of the Department's own making,"" said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, a union that represents many Education Department employees. ""Students, families, and schools have paid the price for this chaos.""

The department did not respond to a request to share the current size of OCR's complaint backlog, but one department source who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Trump administration, told NPR that OCR now has about 25,000 pending complaints, including roughly 7,000 open investigations.

Gittleman said the administration's decision to keep these OCR attorneys on paid leave ""has already wasted more than $40 million in taxpayer funds— rather than letting them do their jobs.""

NPR could not independently verify that cost.

In October, the administration attempted to fire another 137 OCR staffers, though they were reinstated as part of a deal to end the government shutdown.

In all, just 62 employees at OCR have not received a termination notice at some point this year — about 10% of the office's January headcount.

Two days before the department notified staff they were being recalled, NPR reported on the impact these OCR cuts have had on students with disabilities and their families.

Maggie Heilman told NPR that she filed a complaint with OCR in 2024, alleging that her daughter, who has Down syndrome, was denied her right to a free, appropriate public education at school. OCR began investigating in October 2024, but it was disrupted repeatedly by the aforementioned staff cuts. Heilman's case remains one of the roughly 7,000 open investigations.

Of the administration's decision to try to cut many attorneys who protect students' civil rights, Heilman said, ""it's telling families with children like [my daughter] that their hurt doesn't matter.""

Since Trump took office, public data shows that OCR has reached resolution agreements in 73 cases involving alleged disability discrimination. Compare that to 2024, when OCR resolved 390, or 2017, the year Trump took office during his first term, when OCR reached agreements in more than 1,000 such cases.

ICE in Cedar-Riverside

What we know:

Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman, who represents Ward 6, described the scene in a statement released Tuesday night. In the statement, Osman shared an account from a constituent who witnessed the ICE operation Tuesday afternoon in Cedar-Riverside and went to check on his neighbors. The resident, a legal U.S. citizen, said he was stopped and ""harassed"" by ICE agents despite his legal status.

The backstory:

In the statement, Osman recounts:

""Mobashir, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen who has lived in Minneapolis since he was 1-year-old, was working at a restaurant on the top floor of a building in Cedar-Riverside when he observed ICE agents harassing individuals in the parking lot below. Concerned for his neighbors, he descended the back stairs to assess the situation. Upon stepping outside, two agents immediately rushed him, tackled him to the ground, and applied a chokehold, leaving him confused and terrified.""

Despite attempts to verify his legal status, Mobashir was taken to a detention center in Bloomington. When he was finally released, Osman says Mobashir wasn't offered any transportation back to Cedar-Riverside and was told to ""walk"" back in the winter storm.

What they're saying:

""I felt targeted,"" Mobashir told reporters during a news conference on Wednesday. ""Any Somali he sees, I guess he just wants to tackle them and push them to the ground.""

""This was a person who was out on the street doing literally nothing wrong,"" added Mayor Frey. ""And what we saw by these ICE agents, who clearly did not know what they were doing, was violence and unwillingness to hear the simple truth, which he was repeating again and again, which is 'I'm an American citizen.' Those were the words that he was saying again and again. Those words, if nothing else, should give them a minute of pause so that they could find out, 'Hey, who are you? What's your name? Are you a citizen or not? Have you done literally anything wrong at all other than existing in the world?'""

Group pepper sprayed in Cedar-Riverside

Local perspective:

The Associated Press also detailed the confrontation in Cedar-Riverside, including a group of protesters who were pepper sprayed by ICE agents.

According to the report, the group was blocking the agents' vehicles as they checked identifications in the neighborhood. According to Osman, the agents only found U.S. citizens, no undocumented immigrants. According to the report, the agents were ultimately confronted by a group of ""mostly white young people"" who blew whistles to alert people in the area.

It appears the only person taken into custody during the afternoon operation was Mobashir.

Big picture view:

The Trump administration has sent as many as 100 ICE agents to the Twin Cities over the past week as part of a special immigration operation targeting Somali immigrants. President Trump has cited fraud cases, like Feeding our Future, which have involved members of the Somali community, as his basis for the targeted initiative.

Speaking on Tuesday, President Trump once again revived his attacks on the Somali community and Minnesota's leadership.

""If you don't share our values, contribute to our economy, and assimilate into our society, then we don't want you in our country, we don't want you,"" the president said during a speech in Pennsylvania. ""Ilhan Omar and the people from Somalia, they hate our country, and they think we're stupid people, which actually, when they allow that to happen, they are. That's headed by, Governor Walz, one of the dumber people around. But think of it, he's given not like peanuts, billions. These are people that don't work at their own country. Their own country is a failure. They have no money, and yet they come into our country and steal tens of billions of dollars.

Rojas’ traumatic experience is typical of ICE activity in the region, said Genevra Alberti, an immigration attorney in Kansas City, Missouri.
He arrived in the Kansas City area in April 2016 and said he struggled to find adequate legal representation.
They wanted to know why federal agents were chasing somebody through their jurisdiction.
And with the very, very different way that I was easily employed in Kansas City, it is very harsh here,” Rojas said.","TOPEKA — A roving patrol of federal agents chased Julio Rojas through the Olathe streets in August and, after capturing him, put a knee on his neck while they wrapped him in chains.

Like most of the people detained as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation blitz, Rojas had no criminal record. The federal agents had no warrant for his arrest.

As the 25-year-old bounced from Kansas City to Oklahoma to Louisiana during 23 days in custody, Rojas never had the chance to talk to an attorney and never appeared before a judge. He was placed on a plane at 2 a.m. one morning and flown to El Salvador, where he remains.

“What has impacted me the most is being separated from my child, and to lose everything I had built in 10 years,” he said through an interpreter during a video call with reporters last month.

Rojas was in custody when his son turned 7. The boy remains here with his mother, who has permanent residency.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has dramatically escalated efforts to round up immigrants at President Donald Trump’s behest, often with disregard for their civil rights. The Trump administration’s fast-track deportation policies have been challenged at least 362 times in federal district courts, The Conversation reported. It has lost 350 of those cases before 160 different judges. The administration continues to defend the lack of due process in deportation proceedings.

Rojas’ traumatic experience is typical of ICE activity in the region, said Genevra Alberti, an immigration attorney in Kansas City, Missouri.

She described roving patrols in unmarked vehicles, with agents who won’t identify themselves or show ID, and who don’t explain why they are taking someone into custody.

Some agents, she said, “clearly get enjoyment out of arresting, detaining noncitizens, even those who have no criminal history and have families, and those people are just having a ball.”

“In a different time, the subjects of those arrests would have thought they were being kidnapped for real, by actual criminals, because of the way this has been done,” Alberti said. “However, because they know that this is going on now, they just assume it’s ICE, but they don’t know that for sure.”

‘Another rat to the count’

Rojas grew up in El Salvador and said he came to the United States at age 16 as an asylum seeker, trying to get away from gangs.

He arrived in the Kansas City area in April 2016 and said he struggled to find adequate legal representation. He missed a key hearing, and a deportation order was issued. But as he determined to work through a bewildering appeals process, he made a home in Olathe, started a family, and went to work for Verizon and AT&T, installing internet, he said.

His life was upended one morning in early August when four trucks approached him in his vehicle at an auto parts store. He said they pursued him for about 10 minutes before they stopped him.

He recalled an agent with a gun in his hand.

“He was repeating, ‘Get the f*** on the ground.’ Like, all the time, just yelling at me,” Rojas said. “So all that I did was that I kneeled. I put my hands up. And in no moment I was resisting. He came by, and he hit me in the back. And then he put his knee on my neck.”

The agents put chains on his waist, feet and hands, he said.

“That’s when this officer started saying, ‘There’s another rat to the count,’ ” Rojas said.

He was one of 32,364 people booked by ICE in August 2025, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data collection center at Syracuse University. The data shows more than 70% of ICE detainees have no criminal record.

Court records show Rojas’ only interaction with the law was a traffic ticket in 2018 for driving without a license. He paid the $100 fine.

“At the beginning, the administration began to say the only people who would be deported are the people who have crimes in the United States,” Rojas said. “But in this moment, how immigrants’ rights are being violated, all of those people who have a deportation order, it doesn’t matter what the reason is.”

After he was taken into custody, Rojas said he overheard a call from Olathe police. They wanted to know why federal agents were chasing somebody through their jurisdiction.

The federal agent’s response, according to Rojas: “Tell that bitch to not mind our business.”

Olathe police Sgt. John Moncayo said “we don’t know anything about what occurred” with Rojas.

“It appears that Mr. Rojas’ story is embellished quite a bit, as we do not have any information to support his claims,” Moncayo said.

Moncayo didn’t answer a Kansas Reflector question about the police department’s relationship with ICE.

‘Making this normal’

Alberti, the immigration attorney, said she has clients who were pulled over by federal agents for “literally no reason other than how they looked.”

Then, she said, they are arrested and detained. Some are no longer here. Some are still in custody. None has a criminal history.

She described ICE enforcement in the Kanas City area as “being on steroids.”

“I have never seen or heard of this many sort of roving patrols happening here in this area before,” she said. “And what I mean by that is just ICE themselves pulling people over while they’re driving for no reason. ICE has no authority to pull people over for traffic infractions or anything like that, so they are literally just pulling them over because they look foreign. So basically, a lot of these people are just being pulled over for driving while brown.”

She said it is easy to run when you don’t know who is chasing you. Rojas described his arrest as the moment he was most afraid in his life.

ICE officers aren’t allowed to arrest someone without a warrant, Alberti said, unless they have probable cause to believe the person is a flight risk. But if someone has a removal order, as Rojas did, no warrant is needed.

“One of the scary things is ICE is making it normal to not identify yourself,” Alberti said. “I mean, on top of everything else, they’re wearing masks. Their faces are covered. They look like paramilitaries or bank robbers, for God’s sakes, and they’re making this normal.”

She urged people to pay attention to what is happening with immigration enforcement. Even people “whose hearts are in the right places” are overwhelmed by bad news and have stopped listening, she said.

“I get that it’s necessary for mental health purposes, maybe, to take a break once in a while from listening to the news and just hearing nothing but bad things all the time,” Alberti said. “But right now is not the time to do that. Take a day off and then go back and listen to what’s going on, because apathy is going to ruin this country.”

‘Very harsh here’

Rojas said he wore the same clothes for eight days straight at the ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana. At times he went without a toothbrush or blanket. He had one minute one time to make a phone call.

“At no moment did they ever present me with an arrest warrant, did they ever let me see a judge. They never told me anything,” he said.

One night at 8 p.m., officials took him from his cell, held him somewhere else for a few hours, handcuffed and shackled him with chains, then put him on a plane bound for San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. There, local authorities held him for eight hours to investigate whether he had any outstanding arrest warrants. Then they took him to a place called “the house of the immigrant,” where he was given clothes and shampoo.

He misses his son, and hopes to return to the United States someday, “in the most legal way possible.”

“In this moment, I have been two months without a job. And with the very, very different way that I was easily employed in Kansas City, it is very harsh here,” Rojas said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-11-05-143644-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 15:57:10.179948

Some principals reported that they were “unsure what had happened to a few of their students from immigrant families”, the report said.
Principals said students were impacted by ICE enforcement efforts in their communities, but also by a growing anti-immigrant atmosphere among the student population.
A Michigan principal recounted students saying: “Your parents are border hoppers,” adding that she had taken disciplinary action against bullying.
“High school principals are charged both by professional standards and moral obligation to ensure that students feel safe, and it’s clear students feeling safe at school is essential for their learning,” Rogers said.","Immigrant students across the US have experienced increased bullying, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns causing declines in attendance and a “culture of fear” among immigrant students in public schools, according to a new survey of high school principals.

Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access (Idea) conducted a “nationally representative” survey of more than 600 principals about the toll of raids and deportations, and how schools were responding.

Many principals described a “climate of distress”, the report found, with 70.4% reporting that students from immigrant families have “expressed concerns about their well-being or the well-being of their families”. A majority of public high schools experienced declines in attendance and learning of students from immigrant families, the report said, with 57.8% of principals reporting that immigrant parents and guardians had “left the community” during the school year.

Some principals reported that they were “unsure what had happened to a few of their students from immigrant families”, the report said. And 63.8% of principals said students had missed school “due to policies or political rhetoric related to immigrants”.

Principals said students were impacted by ICE enforcement efforts in their communities, but also by a growing anti-immigrant atmosphere among the student population. More than one-third of the principals said students from immigrant families had reported being “bullied or harassed”, with one Minnesota principal saying: “There has been definitely an uptick in comments made by white students, white male students, to our Hispanic students: ‘Can I see your papers?’”

A Nebraska principal described an increase in students’ “use of hostile and derogatory language” toward Latino students, with taunts like: “Go back home”. A Michigan principal recounted students saying: “Your parents are border hoppers,” adding that she had taken disciplinary action against bullying.

The survey, conducted over the summer, also found the vast majority of schools were taking actions to address the needs of their immigrant populations “as best as they can”, with 77.6% of principals saying they “created a school plan to respond to visits from federal agents”. Nearly half of the principals said they had plans to address the needs of students if their guardians are deported.

“Principals are telling stories of students being dropped off at school and worrying that will be the last time they see their parents. It’s devastating,” John Rogers, Idea director and lead researcher, said in an interview. He said he was struck by the fact that so many school leaders were preparing for that outcome: “It speaks to a normalization of a system that is being put in place that creates extraordinary trauma.”

One principal compared the stress of worrying about ICE showing up to the anxiety of fearing mass shooters.

Rogers said he expected to see these concerns in a city like Los Angeles, which has a large immigrant population and has been an aggressive target of the federal government. But the survey found consequences in schools across the nation in a diverse range of communities, he said.

“High school principals are charged both by professional standards and moral obligation to ensure that students feel safe, and it’s clear students feeling safe at school is essential for their learning,” Rogers said. “At the same time, they realize their power is limited … they can’t control what is going on outside of school.”

A Massachusetts principal surveyed said: “There is something just so fundamentally wrong about this – we continue to strive to make school a safe place where all students can thrive, but this task has become increasingly challenging.”

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the report on Tuesday.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb759feb46bba1e075f122e204e4d77ef6cfeea/40_0_1959_1567/master/1959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dbed2f82f63240e454226a5597f51a2d",N,,2025-12-10 13:57:34.101069

As four students seeking asylum in the U.S. remained in federal immigration custody Tuesday night, dozens of community members asked Detroit school officials to do more to protect newcomers.

All four of the students went to Western International High School in Southwest Detroit.

Before public comment began at the Detroit Public Schools Community District board meeting, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district and the board would release a statement calling for the students’ release.

“These continue to be troubling times for the district and our immigrant population,” Vitti said. “We do advocate for our federal government to find better uses of its time and resources to attack the real problems in our society and not immigrant populations.”

Vitti said the district will continue to work with advocacy groups to support the students and will distribute information to students about their rights.

He said immigration officials have not attempted to enter district property.

Many at the meeting said the letter wasn’t enough. They want the district to take a harder stance against immigration enforcement. Among their demands were mandatory staff training, safer transportation, and counseling for students with immigration concerns.

“It’s time to stop being scared,” Heidi West, a teacher at Academy of the Americas, said to the board. “Speak up strongly and publicly.”

There have been at least five DPSCD students detained by ICE in the months since federal immigration enforcement ramped up in the second Trump administration.

‘Shattered dreams’ for students detained by ICE

All four students had pending court dates in asylum cases, said Christine Sauvé, manager of policy and communication at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.

Mor Ba, a 19-year-old who came to the U.S. without any family from Senegal in April, graduated from Western International last month.

The night before his detention, Ba filled out college applications, Adja Ndoye of the Detroit-based African Bureau for Immigrants and Social Affairs said. Ba planned to study mechanical engineering.

“He was already going around and asking about apprenticeships,” said Ndoye. “He had his goals set on how to make a new life. I think he was thriving. He was the embodiment of the American dream.”

On Nov. 26, police stopped Ba and blocked his vehicle in search of another person, Ndoye said. The teen, who was on his way to work, provided the officers his identification to confirm he was not the person they were looking for, but was still taken into custody, she said.

Ba is being held at the Northlake Correctional Facility in Baldwin about three and half hours north of Detroit, ICE records show. He had a pending asylum case with a court date scheduled for early next year, Ndoye said.

On Sunday, Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez, a 17-year-old in 11th grade from Venezuela, was taken into ICE custody, according to Kristen Schoettle, one of his Western International teachers.

The teen and his mother were reportedly pulled over by police in Fraser for driving under the speed limit, Sauvé said.

Zamora Perez is a star baseball player with good grades and aspirations of playing in college, according to his teachers.

Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and Antony Janier Peña Sosa, 16-year-old cousins who came to the U.S. in 2023 from Venezuela were taken into immigration custody on Nov. 20. with two of their parents. Federal agents raided their home on the eastside of Detroit while the family slept, attorney George Washington said at a recent protest outside of Western International. The agents were searching for another person.

Sosa Rivero, an 11th grader, plays volleyball, shared alternative indie rock music with her teacher, and looked forward to attending college.

Peña Sosa, in 10th grade, plays the violin, excelled in Advanced Placement art class, and was quickly learning English, according to his teachers.

The three students under 18 were sent to facilities in Texas, Sauvé said.

Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an 18-year-old who attended Western International, was detained by ICE in May. He was deported to Colombia, where he was born, in June.

Boyoga-Duarte, who arrived in the U.S. at 16, was only 3.5 credits away from graduating. He was working to get the travel documents he needed to return to Colombia before his arrest.

Teachers want for more resources, training

Educators and advocates have been vocal in recent months demanding the district offer know-your-rights training, more counseling, and safer transportation options for students with immigration concerns.

Last month, dozens of people asked the board to update its 2019 “Sanctuary District” policy and train all of its staff in protocols around interacting with ICE. The board did not take any action.

Alexander Cintron, director of the newcomer program at Western International, told Chalkbeat that attendance is being impacted by fears of ICE. “It’s also affecting students’ grades and mental health,” he said.

There is “an undercurrent of despair and anxiety” in students who are immigrants, a teacher of one of the detained students said. The teacher asked for anonymity out of concern about retribution from the district.

“How do you teach someone who had family members yanked from them?” the educator said. “How can I address their constant worries about being stopped at a park by immigration while trying to meet their educational needs?”

Schoettle said she lost around 20 students this year due to immigration issues.

“I had about eight more tell me they wanted to leave today,” she said during Tuesday’s meeting.

Sauvé said schools can play a pivotal role in sharing information. The nonprofit released best practices for schools in February.

“We get so many calls from teachers who say they’re not hearing information from their leadership,” she said.

Seydi Sarr, founder of ABISA, asked district officials to meet with parents of English learners and use their resources to help them advocate to state lawmakers.

“We want you to wield the power that you have to make sure we have a real impact,” she said.

Other speakers asked for the board to meet with English language teachers, a legal support hotline, make it clear educators can give out “Know Your Rights” cards to students, more public condemnation of immigration enforcement from board members, and for the district to support students’ right to protest.

Board members did not address the speakers when public comment ended.

Once the meeting adjourned, some attendees yelled at the board for not responding to their concerns.

“What if it was your kids?” one said.

Corletta Vaughn, chair of the board, said after the meeting that the letter in support of the students would be posted publicly by the end of the week.

There were more than 7,400 English learners in the Detroit district last school year, making up more than 15% of all students.

Around 1,200 students were newcomers in DPSCD last year, meaning they have been in the U.S. for less than three years and are not fluent English speakers.

“Failing to adequately report on human rights violations further damages the credibility of the U.S. on human rights issues.","In August 2025, the U.S. Department of State released its 2024 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, a long-standing, congressionally mandated tool for documenting abuses worldwide. These reports have significant consequences for foreign-policy decisions, funding allocations, asylum adjudications, and immigration enforcement. Worryingly, critics now claim the reports have been reshaped to reflect political priorities rather than objective human-rights analysis.

As Amanda Klasing, National Director of Government Relations and Advocacy at Amnesty International USA, puts it:

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries … In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries—for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people—there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country.”

This sharp critique raises immediate concerns for immigration lawyers and practitioners. Why? Because these reports don’t sit in isolation. They feed into myriad immigration processes—from asylum claims to country-condition evidence, to eligibility for humanitarian-based visas and protections.

Why State Department Human-Rights Reports Matter for Immigration

These reports serve several critical roles:

Country-condition evidence: Asylum applicants often rely on this U.S. government publication to demonstrate systematic human-rights violations in their country of origin.

Diplomatic and enforcement context: U.S. foreign-policy decisions—including refugee admissions, Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Reports, and foreign assistance oversight—hinge in part on these assessments.

Legislative oversight tool: Congress uses the reports to ensure U.S. funding does not benefit regimes known for torture or suppression of fundamental freedoms (see historical mandate under the Foreign Assistance Act).

When these reports become truncated or politicized, the downstream impact is real: weaker evidentiary bases in immigration cases, reduced accountability for perpetrators, and eroded trust in U.S. human-rights leadership. As Klasing noted:

“This sends a chilling message that the U.S. is willing to overlook some abuses, signaling that people experiencing human rights violations may be left to fend for themselves.”

The 2024 Report Changed Dramatically from Previous Years

Key changes flagged by advocates include:

Reduced length and coverage: Some country sections were substantially shortened, with entire categories removed (such as LGBTQ+ rights, gender-based violence, or minority persecution).

Differential treatment of ally vs. adversary countries: Reports on favored nations seemingly softened or omitted significant violations. For example, the section on Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza was limited to just nine pages, without mention of the ongoing International Court of Justice genocide case or starvation claims.

Rewriting of internal instructions: Leaked draft chapters and internal guidance indicate that new instructions from Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed report drafters to “cut everything not legislatively mandated” and to streamline the 2024 Country Reports to the “underlying legislative mandate” and Trump-era executive orders. Former State Department officials say they were told to edit the reports down to the “bare minimum of what was statutorily required,” and human rights groups warn that career human-rights experts inside the State Department have been purged or overridden by political appointees. From an immigration-law perspective, the consequences are troubling: if country-condition evidence becomes less complete, the factual basis of asylum, withholding, CAT, and humanitarian-based applications may be undermined.

What Are the Implications for Immigration Practitioners?

Here are some considerations and tactics for practitioners in light of these developments:

First, I’d recommend you double-check country-condition sources. Don’t rely solely on the State Department report. Given the credible allegations of omissions or downplaying, supplement with reports from non-governmental organizations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and similar. Additionally, you can check United Nations Special Procedures reports and even look into local civil society testimonies or affidavits.

Second, you can raise the issue of weakened reporting as a claim factor. Where country-condition evidence appears incomplete, especially for allied nations or less politically convenient cases, you may argue the insufficiency of the formal report or highlight that omissions themselves reflect risk of harm.

Third, you can document omission risk in asylum and humanitarian cases, for instance, if you are representing a client from a country where the report appears to have been trimmed or shielded, it may bolster the argument of risk by pointing to independent evidence of human-rights violations not reflected in the report. It may also provide grounds to challenge agency reliance on a truncated report as the sole basis for denial.

Reduced human-rights reporting signals broader trends: weakening of monitoring institutions, de-prioritization of certain rights categories (LGBTQ+, gender, minority), and shifting U.S. global posture. These trends may affect future asylum claims, resettlement priorities, and visa-processing policy (e.g., humanitarian-based visas, special-immigrant statuses). This is something you should monitor, and your fellow AILA members will be doing the same.

I realize that these significant changes mean that yet again immigration attorneys are going to have to shift how they advise clients. It can be hard to explain how something as esoteric as State Department reports can have a real impact on their case. But they can, and I really believe they will. So, in my own practice, I’m working to advise clients accordingly. For asylum or withholding/deferral of removal, I talk to them about having to prepare alternative sources and document the gaps in the State Department report. For prospective clients from countries with apparent omissions, I’ll be advising on the timing of filings and the possibility of using supplemental evidence. And I’ll be tracking the timing of reports, delays in release, and patterns of omissions—these may themselves be useful advocacy tools.

What Needs to Change

To restore trust in these important reports and protect their utility for immigration practitioners, several reforms are vital:

Re-establish independence and transparency of the bureau drafting the reports, ensuring career experts, not political appointees, determine content.

Reinstate full coverage of rights categories (gender, LGBTQ+, minority, civil society).

Require public explanation of changes in structure or omissions, so that civil-society users, including immigration advocates—can assess reliability.

Encourage congressional oversight of how reports influence immigration and foreign-assistance decisions.

Until these reforms are implemented, immigration practitioners must remain vigilant: rely on multiple sources, document the gaps, and incorporate the weakness of official reporting into client strategy.

The child care industry depends on immigrants Schools and child care centers were once off limits to ICE officials, in part to keep children out of harm’s way.

Immigrant child care workers and preschool teachers, the majority of whom are working and living in the U.S. legally, say they are wracked by anxiety over possible encounters with ICE officials. Some have left the field, and others have been forced out by changes to immigration policy.

At CentroNía, CEO Myrna Peralta said all staff must have legal status and work authorization. But ICE’s presence and the fear it generates have changed how the school operates.

“That really dominates all of our decision making,” Peralta said.

Instead of taking children on walks through the neighborhood, staff members push children on strollers around the hallways. And staff converted a classroom into a miniature library when the school scrapped a partnership with a local library.

The child care industry depends on immigrants

Schools and child care centers were once off limits to ICE officials, in part to keep children out of harm’s way. But those rules were scrapped not long after Trump’s inauguration. Instead, ICE officials are urged to exercise “common sense.”

Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended ICE officials’ decision to enter the Chicago preschool. She said the teacher, who had a work permit and was later released, was a passenger in a car that was being pursued by ICE officials. She got out of the car and ran into the preschool, McLaughlin said, emphasizing the teacher was “arrested in the vestibule, not in the school.” The man who had been driving went inside the preschool, where officials arrested him.

About one-fifth of America’s child care workers were born outside the United States and one-fifth are Latino. The proportion of immigrants in some places, particularly large cities, is much higher: In the District of Columbia, California and New York, around 40% of the child care workforce is foreign-born, according to UC Berkeley’s Center for the Study of Child Care Employment.

Immigrants in the field tend to be better educated than those born in the United States. Those from Latin America help satisfy the growing demand for Spanish-language preschools, such as CentroNía, where some parents enroll their kids to give them a head start learning another language.

The American Immigration Council estimated in 2021 that more than three-quarters of immigrants working in early care and education were living and working in the U.S. legally. Preschools like CentroNía conduct rigorous background checks, including verifying employees have work authorization.

Beyond the deportation efforts, the Trump administration in recent months has stripped legal status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Many of them had fled violence, poverty or natural disasters in their homes and received Temporary Protected Status, which allowed them to live and work legally in the U.S. But Trump ended those programs, forcing many out of their jobs — and the country. Just last month, 300,000 immigrants from Venezuela lost their protected status.

CentroNía lost two employees when they lost their TPS, Peralta said, and a Nicaraguan immigrant working as a teacher left on his own. Tierra Encantada, which runs Spanish immersion preschools in several states, had a dozen teachers leave when they lost their TPS.

Fear is affecting even those in the US legally

At CentroNía, one staff member was detained by ICE while walking down the street and held for several hours, all the while unable to contact colleagues to let them know where she was. She was released that evening, said the school’s site director, Joangelee Hernández-Figueroa.

Another staff member, teacher Edelmira Kitchen, said she was pulled over by ICE on her way to work in September. Officials demanded she get out of her car so they could question her. Kitchen, a U.S. citizen who immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child, said she refused and they eventually let her go.

“I felt violated of my rights,” Kitchen said.

Hernández-Figueroa said ICE’s heightened presence during the federal intervention in the city has taken a toll on employees’ mental health. Some have gone to the hospital with panic attacks in the middle of the school day.

When the city sent mental health consultants to the school earlier this year as part of a partnership with the Department of Behavioral Health, school leadership had them work with teachers rather than students, worried their anguish would spill over to the classroom.

“If the teachers aren’t good,” Hernández-Figueroa said, “the kids won’t be good either.”

It’s not just adults who are feeling more anxious. At a Guidepost Montessori School in Portland, Oregon, teachers observed preschoolers change in the weeks after an ICE arrest near the school in July. After pulling over a father who was driving his child to the school, officials encountered him in the school parking lot and tried to arrest him. In the ensuing commotion, the school went into lockdown: Children were pulled off the playground, and teachers played loud music and had children sing along to drown out the yelling.

Amy Lomanto, who heads the school, said teachers noticed more outbursts among students, and more students retreating to what the school calls “the regulation station,” an area in the main office with fidget toys kids can use to calm themselves.

She said what unfolded at her school underscored that even wealthy communities, like the one the school serves, are not immune from exposure to these kinds of events.

“With the current situation, more and more of us are likely to experience this kind of trauma,” she said. “That level of fear now is permeating a lot more throughout our society.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/08/GettyImages-1164124771-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 14:57:20.271296

“We will organize more, put our hands and efforts together and fight back” Jama said, who thanked the protesters who showed up when federal officers arrived in Cedar-Riverside Tuesday.","A Minneapolis man said federal immigration officers chased him on foot in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood Tuesday, tackled him and handcuffed and arrested him even though he’s a U.S. citizen.

He shared his story Tuesday, identifying himself as Mubashir, but declining to share his last name. Mubashir spoke at a news conference organized by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN) after video of his arrest was widely viewed on social media.

“I just felt targeted,” Mubashir said. “That shouldn’t happen to anyone, that’s not right.”

In the video, a federal officer is seen putting Mubashir in a choke hold and forcing him onto his knees in the snow as he was on his way to get food. Mubashir said he told officers multiple times that he is a U.S. citizen and asked if he could show them his I.D. Officers ignored him, dragged him in the snow and pushed him into a car as witnesses yelled and blew whistles, according to the video of his arrest.

The video also showed witnesses chasing after the car in traffic; one person stood in front of the vehicle at one point.

The arrest occurred as federal agents walked into nearby businesses in the Somali-heavy neighborhood, questioning people and asking them to show their passports.

Mubashir said he was in the car with officers for about 20 minutes, asking them repeatedly if he could show them his I.D. They refused, he said.

Officers asked if they could take a picture of him to check if he was a U.S. citizen. Mubashir told reporters that he declined their request, because, “How would a picture prove I’m a U.S. citizen?”

Officers took him to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling, which houses immigration court and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices. They took his fingerprints and then one of the officers allowed Mubashir to show his I.D., proving his U.S. citizenship, Mubashir said. He was then immediately allowed to leave.

Mubashir said he asked if the officers could take him home to Cedar-Riverside, but they refused. They told him to walk home, he said, so his parents picked him up.

“I deserve to be here like anyone else — I’m a U.S. citizen,” he said. “I can’t even step outside without being tackled — no question — because I’m Somali.”

Mubashir has lived in Minneapolis since he was a year old, according to a newsletter published by Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman.

“This young man is a bright, hardworking member of our community, and his experience is a stark reminder of the overreach and lack of accountability in ICE operations,” read Osman’s newsletter.

At least two other local Somali residents were arrested by federal immigration officers Tuesday and then released, because they are also U.S. citizens, said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN.

CAIR-MN has received many calls from Somali residents who are U.S. citizens reporting that they were arrested or questioned by federal agents since “Operation Metro Surge” started last week targeting their community, Hussein said. There are varying reports of how long officers kept residents in detention before they were released, he added.

“We believe this is a violation of our constitution,” Jaylani said, adding that his organization is potentially considering legal action to address “this particular abuse of power.”

Another similar incident involving the arrest of a U.S. citizen of Somali descent occurred last Wednesday, according to a Fox 9 news article. A Somali woman was detained while she was running errands in downtown Minneapolis and held in ICE custody for 24 hours. Her cousin told Fox 9 that federal agents mocked her hijab and “touched her inappropriately.”

Fox 9 also reported that two Somali U.S. citizens were questioned by federal officers last Tuesday.

Jaylani urged Somali Minnesotans to call CAIR-MN at 612-206-3360 if ICE agents question or arrest them. CAIR-MN has organized a task force to respond to ICE arrests.

Hassan Jama, an imam at the Al-Hikam Islamic Center in Minneapolis, is a task force member. He said he’s seen an increase in racist rhetoric targeting Somalis, including at restaurants and schools.

The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order.","The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to take up the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s order on birthright citizenship declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices will hear Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the country.

The case will be argued in the spring. A definitive ruling is expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, is part of his Republican administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings. But the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. His order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

The Supreme Court, however, did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order was constitutional.

Every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship. Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under longstanding rules.

The case under review comes from New Hampshire. A federal judge in July blocked the citizenship order in a class action lawsuit including all children who would be affected. The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, the ACLU’s national legal director, said in a statement, adding, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

The administration had also asked the justices to review a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. That court, also in July, ruled that a group of Democratic-led states that sued over Trump’s order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others. The justices took no action in the 9th Circuit case.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children — not ... to the children of aliens illegally or temporarily in the United States,” top administration top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, wrote in urging the high court’s review.

Attorneys for detainees highlighted the government’s own admissions to longer custody times for immigrant children, contaminated food, a lack of access to medical care or sufficient legal counsel reported by families and monitors at federal facilities, as well as a renewed reliance on hotels for detention.

The attorneys’ reports were filed late Monday in a civil lawsuit launched in 1985 that led to the creation in 1997 of court-ordered supervision of standards and eventually established a 20-day limit in custody. The Trump administration is attempting to end the agreement.

A Dec. 1 report from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement indicated that about 400 immigrant children were held in custody for more than the 20-day limit from August to September. They told the court the problem was widespread and not specific to a region or facility. The primary factors that prolonged their release were categorized into three groups: transportation delays, medical needs, and legal processing.

Legal advocates for the children contended those reasons do not prove lawful justifications for the delays in their release. Through interviews with detained families, advocates identified five children held for 168 days. The report didn’t say how old those children were.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Hotel use for temporary detention is allowed by the federal court for up to 72 hours, but attorneys questioned the government’s data, which they believe did not fully explain why children were held longer than three days in hotel rooms.

Conditions at the detention facilities continued to be an ongoing concern since the family detention site in Dilley, Texas, reopened this year.

Advocates documented injuries suffered by children and a lack of access to sufficient medical care. One child bleeding from an eye injury wasn’t seen by medical staff for two days. Another child’s foot was broken when a member of the staff dropped a volleyball net pole, according to the court filing. “Medical staff told one family whose child got food poisoning to only return if the child vomited eight times,” the advocates wrote in their response.

“Children get diarrhea, heartburn, stomach aches, and they give them food that literally has worms in it,” one person with a family staying at the facility in Dilley wrote in a declaration submitted to the court. Another wrote that they were given “broccoli and cauliflower that were moldy and had worms.”

Chief U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee of the Central District of California is scheduled to have a hearing on the reports next week, where she could decide if the court needs to intervene.

This week’s pick of news and commentary about solitary confinement:

A recent report from Amnesty International found that immigrants housed at “Alligator Alcatraz” and a second Florida detention facility face “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” that may violate international law. The report describes severe overcrowding, lack of medical care, and “alarming” disciplinary practices, including the use of prolonged solitary confinement and a 2-by-2 foot outdoor cage where immigrants are left shackled for days without water. The Guardian | According to the report, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official told Amnesty that the minimum solitary sentence is 24 hours, but that people can be held there for up to 30 days. During a tour of the solitary unit at Krome North Services Processing Center, a man pushed a sign asking for help through the metal flap in his cell door. When an Amnesty staffer stopped to speak with the man, who stated that he has been waiting 37 days to receive medical attention for a broken hand, a guard began to repeatedly smash the man’s injured hand with the metal flap in the door to his solitary cell. Amnesty International is now calling on the United Nations to appoint an independent monitor to investigate both facilities. Florida Phoenix

Over the last decade, thousands of people incarcerated at Florida’s Gulf Coast Correctional Facility (GCCF) have filed complaints of staff abuse and misconduct. Interviews conducted by a team of attorneys and advocates revealed a prolific culture of violence at the facility, which is reinforced by its overuse of solitary confinement. According to the investigation, people in solitary confinement are often punished with property restriction, which involves stripping an individual down to their underwear and removing all items from their cell, or withholding meals. Southern Poverty Law Center

During his 300 days in solitary confinement, Samuel Smalls realized that the dogs being walked in the yard received more freedom than he did. Smalls is one of 6,000 incarcerated people in Maryland who spent time in solitary confinement in 2024. As the use of solitary confinement continues to increase in Maryland, so has the rate of violent assaults among incarcerated people and by staff. The Baltimore Banner | According to a government report, disciplinary segregation accounted for two-thirds of all solitary confinement placements in 2024—a 38 percent increase from 2023. Although Maryland officials continue to assert that solitary is essential for managing violence in the state’s prisons, they claim that they are working on ways to decrease the number and duration of placements.

At Dauphine County Jail in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, individuals are held in near-constant isolation without access to sunlight or fresh air. Imhotep Muhammad was allowed outside just once during the 26 months he spent in pretrial detention at the jail before being acquitted of the charges against him. As a result of these conditions, Muhammad suffered from severe Vitamin D and B12 deficiency which caused his health to deteriorate even after his release. Muhammad’s only day of outdoor recreation while incarcerated at Dauphine, Labor Day 2024, was the first time in 20 years that people held at the facility were allowed outside. PennLive

In their annual report, the New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson has raised concerns about the fragility of the state’s prison system. Compiling notes from in-person inspections of the state’s nine prisons and testimony from more than one thousand interviews with incarcerated people, the report highlights severe staffing shortages and the continued deterioration of solitary confinement units. According to advocates, the conditions of these units violate the standards of care set by the state’s Isolated Confinement Restriction Act (ICRA) of 2019. NJ.com

After Jerry Cintron overdosed on a fentanyl-laced pill while incarcerated at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC), he refused to cooperate when investigators asked where he got the drugs. In response, through a series of disciplinary hearings, RIDOC determined the appropriate punishment for Cintron was 450 days in solitary confinement. Cintron has since sued RIDOC, claiming that his solitary sentence caused his physical and mental health to deteriorate and officers ignored his appeals for help, which violated his Eighth Amendment rights. The federal First Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled in Cintron’s favor, stating that, while solitary is justified to improve safety, officials “cannot—in the face of that prisoner’s deterioration—perpetuate the kind of social, sensory, and sleep deprivation that Cintron alleges.” Corrections1

Tariq MaQbool began studying law while in solitary confinement at Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearny, New Jersey. Despite his best efforts, he was still unable to understand his own court proceedings. However, instead of giving up, he joined the Inmate Legal Association following his transfer to the New Jersey State Penitentiary. Now as a prison lawyer, he advocates for those who are unable to access professional legal services. Prison lawyers like MaQbool often face retaliation for their work, including placement in solitary confinement. Al Jazeera

Korean Americans Targeted by ICE

•38-year-old arrested, detained: The Korea Daily reports that a Korean-American – who arrived in the US at 3-months-old – was arrested and sent to detention at the Adelanto ICE Detention Center after he and his US citizen wife attended a scheduled interview for family-based residency at US Citizen & Immigration offices in LA. The case is scheduled for a hearing at the end of March 2026. Similar cases involving citizen family-based applicants adjusting status – all with no criminal record – are being reported.

Some cases involve simple address errors. “Attorney Wanseok Oh explained, “In the past, simple overstays by immediate relatives of US citizens were not treated as major issues during interviews, and arrests almost never happened. But since the Trump administration, both adjudication and enforcement have become stricter, and even small issues in an applicant’s older records can lead to arrest at the interview.

Applicants can report address changes online by creating an account at uscis.gov or by mailing the AR-11 form. Each family member must file individually, even if they moved together. Only the applicant’s current address must be listed, regardless of prior moves. Even if the 10-day deadline has passed, attorneys say filing now remains the safest option.”

Oh emphasized, “As immigration policy becomes stricter, even small obligations can lead to real enforcement. Until someone becomes a U.S. citizen, they must manage address updates and record maintenance with much greater diligence.”Until someone becomes a U.S. citizen, they must manage address updates and record maintenance with much greater diligence.””

•Undocumented Immigrants in Orange County (2025 Data)

A report by the USC Equity Research Institute based on data.

The recent attacks on immigrants have harmed communities and sown fear. People are being taken in unmarked vehicles and disappeared without their right to due process. People are not going to work, businesses and restaurants are shutting down, food prices are on the rise, schools, hospitals, and churches are no longer safe.

These raids are devastating our economy, with statewide losses under a scenario of deporting all undocumented workers hovering around $275 billion, caused by labor shortages, delays, increased prices, and decreased business activity. A single raid can destabilize a neighborhood’s entire economy and can have resounding effects to disrupt entire industries. Unable to afford missing work, some force themselves to work in an atmosphere of fear that extends to the families and friends of undocumented immigrants.

The immigration raids ripple through every aspect of our lives and make communities less safe for everyone, not just undocumented immigrants.

Closing the courts The Advocates for Human Rights began their court observation project in 2017, during Trump’s first term, to track immigration court hearings and monitor individual cases.
Immigration court hearings are open to the public, though they can be closed in cases where confidentiality is an issue.
In the past, these details would be removed only for confidential cases, but this is now happening daily, court observers say.
According to Katie Fleming, director of public engagement and education, Fort Snelling Immigration Court is not an outlier when it comes to access issues.","At the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling, judges determine whether immigrants from Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota with asylum claims, removal orders or other immigration claims will be legally allowed to remain in the country.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents now wait in the hallways, too, ready to detain individuals whose cases are increasingly being dismissed in a spate of motions from government attorneys.

There are other, more welcoming, faces as well, including a group of individuals who for eight years have been coming to Fort Snelling to sit in on immigration court hearings and monitor them. They are court observers, belonging to Minnesota organization The Advocates for Human Rights.

These observers have been a constant presence in courtrooms, meticulously documenting immigration hearings to maintain accountability in the immigration system. But in October, a change occurred at Fort Snelling. Clerks told court observers and others that hearings were closed, and doors to publicly available courtrooms were locked. Now, in Fort Snelling and immigration courts across the country, observers say they are increasingly being shut out and unable to observe the proceedings.

Closing the courts

The Advocates for Human Rights began their court observation project in 2017, during Trump’s first term, to track immigration court hearings and monitor individual cases. Since then, trained court observers have been a daily presence at Fort Snelling, taking systematic notes on immigration cases and tracking defendants as they progress through the system. For Madeline Lohman, advocacy and outreach director at The Advocates, the project is a tool for upholding democracy.

“Authoritarianism thrives in secrecy,” Lohman said. “The way governments consolidate power at the expense of the people is that they make their decisions in places that you can’t evaluate whether what they’re saying is true or not.”

The Advocates have consistently had volunteers at Fort Snelling Immigration Court since the project began in 2017, though Lohman says the total number increased significantly after Trump was elected for a second term.

Immigration court hearings generally fall into one of three categories: bond hearings, which determine whether a person will remain in detention during their case; master calendar hearings, procedural hearings to establish immigration charges against defendants; and individual hearings, often referred to as merits hearings, where the final decision on an immigration case is made.

Since October, court observers have frequently shown up to court only to be told that hearings of all types are closed to the public. Doors are now locked by default, unless a judge specifically asks for them to be opened.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, though they can be closed in cases where confidentiality is an issue. Judges also have discretion to close hearings to protect any party in the case, witnesses, or the public interest, even if the hearing would otherwise be public. Judges were slow to exercise this power in the past however, with the public generally allowed access to the majority of hearings.

Amy Lange, head of The Advocates’ court observation project, said it was rare for the public to be shut out of master calendar hearings in particular.

“We would see one of those every three months, and now this is on a daily basis,” Lange said. “There are times now when an observer will show up to court and they will say a judge is closing a courtroom for the entire day.”

Lange identified four instances since October where master calendar hearings were closed for at least the entire morning case docket, with hearings being closed the entire day of Oct. 27. She said staff from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which manages the nation’s immigration courts, has cited confidentiality as the reason for closing master calendar hearings, which overwhelmingly deal with pleadings, scheduling, and other matters not specific to an individual’s case.

“I don’t understand why a master calendar hearing would be closed to the public,” she said. “By their definition, they’re procedural.”

Merits hearings have also been increasingly closed to the public. While these individual hearings have historically been more likely to be closed to the public for confidentiality purposes, Lange says it was typically done at the behest of the defendant. She identified at least three instances since October that merits hearings were closed off to the public without individual consideration, including one in which the client’s attorney had granted permission in advance for court observers to be present.

For Lange, this increase in closed hearings raises alarm over court accountability.

“You have to operate consistently, transparently and accountably,” she said. “We have to wonder if that’s happening when closures are unexplained and indiscriminate.”

In addition to closing hearings, case dockets have increasingly been stripped of identifying details, making them difficult to track. Names are frequently removed, making it harder for both the public and respondents to get updates on cases. In the past, these details would be removed only for confidential cases, but this is now happening daily, court observers say.

Fort Snelling security has also replaced EOIR staff as the party responsible for admitting the public into the courtroom. Because these guards are not EOIR employees, they are unable to communicate with judges unless directly called. Lange said this has led to breakdowns in communication between courtrooms and observers.

To date, EOIR has not issued any policies or memos dictating additional closures of public courtrooms. A November fact sheet issued by EOIR says that judges can close a hearing based on a request from any party in the case; if the judge needs to limit attendance; or if closing the court is required by law.

The fact sheet also states that Webex links for hearings are reserved for parties appearing remotely. The public had previously been able to observe hearings remotely.

In an email to Sahan Journal, EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly cited the fact sheet as justification for increased hearing closures although it did not spell out any rationale for the change. She did not respond to Sahan’s questions about why court employees are locking courtroom doors by default and using guards rather than EOIR staff to communicate with judges.

The big picture

Across the country, immigration courts are putting similar restrictions in place.

The Acacia Center for Justice, a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit, has been connecting with court observation groups nationwide to coordinate efforts and improve information sharing. According to Katie Fleming, director of public engagement and education, Fort Snelling Immigration Court is not an outlier when it comes to access issues.

Fleming said courts in many states have experienced similar issues. In her home city of Sacramento, there have been blanket denials of public access to court buildings, including the news media. Immigration court officials have also accused observers of loitering or soliciting as justification for keeping them out of the courtroom or courthouse hallways, and they have prohibited observers from talking to respondents in the hallways or sharing supporting resources with them.

Fleming said that court restrictions are being enforced inconsistently, even within the same state. To Fleming, these actions serve a clear purpose.

“It is my understanding and my belief that the administration is trying to limit public access to courtrooms because court observers can and will hold them accountable for due process violations,” she said.

Fleming added that court observers can make a tangible impact on cases.

“It can have an effect on the outcome of the case to have folks in the courtroom,” she said. “Whether it helps judges to be on their best behavior or be more thorough or the government attorney to be on better behavior, it is important to have those observers present.”

Observers from The Advocates for Human Rights will continue showing up at Fort Snelling Immigration Court. To Lohman, doing so is a fundamental responsibility of democracy. How much they will be able to see remains unclear.

“If you can’t gather independent verifiable information, then the government gets to say whatever they want about what’s happening and you can’t use the democratic process to hold them accountable,” Lohman said. “You’ve been stripped of your ability to know what’s happening and react.”",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhippleBuilding-9290.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:57:01.223470

And of course, persons don’t lose their human rights because of an irregular arrival.
This misses the idea of the Convention which is not about democratic majorities but about human rights: rights that are independent from someone’s citizenship and that are not at the discretion of the majority.
Firstly, the Court did not hear many cases during the existence of the European Commission of Human Rights.","As we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the topic of migration stands at the center of concerns about the Convention’s state of health. In this blogpost adapted from my remarks at a Conference in the Federal Ministry for Justice and Consumer Protection, I argue that those attacking the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for an over-reaching jurisprudence regarding migrants’ rights misconstrue the actual case law. It is worth looking back at the early landmark cases to understand that the interpretation of Article 3 in relation to expulsion and deportation cases developed cautiously. While a critique of the Court’s decisions is the legitimate task of legal scholarship, simplistic narratives about an activist Court fail to engage with its doctrinal stringency.

Open threats to the Convention

One of the foremost birthday wishes is the wish for good health. So, as we are celebrating the ECHR’s 75th anniversary, I would like to wish good health to the European Convention on Human Rights. To take care of someone’s health, wishes are not enough though – it also needs doctor visits. In some way, interrogating the area of migration and the ECHR resembles a doctor visit, because in no other area is the health of the Convention so much at risk as it is in the area of migration.

A most evident threat to the Convention’s health is the “lettera aperta”, the open letter initiated by Denmark and Italy and signed by a total of nine European heads of state. The letter openly calls for a politically motivated restrictive interpretation of migrants’ rights and, in its assumptions, breaks with the spirit of universality of human rights. One of the many astonishing misconceptions of the lettera aperta is that it tells a story about two groups of migrants: those who come regularly, integrate well and contribute to the societies, and those who come irregularly, don’t integrate and in some cases commit crimes. To juxtapose those categories is out of touch with the reality, in which irregular pathways are the only possibility and therefore normal for most of those seeking international protection. Already the 1951 Refugee Convention reacts to this reality with its principle of non-penalization. The persisting attempt to denigrate asylum seekers for the irregularity of their arrival is at odds with the core of international refugee law. And of course, persons don’t lose their human rights because of an irregular arrival. The lettera aperta also repeatedly refers to “our citizens” whose opinions it claims to represent. This misses the idea of the Convention which is not about democratic majorities but about human rights: rights that are independent from someone’s citizenship and that are not at the discretion of the majority. Finally, the plea that there should be “more room nationally to decide on when to expel criminal foreign nationals” misses the nature of human rights protection: The basic limitations that the Convention sets for expelling persons are the limits of Article 3 ECHR, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. This prohibition applies regardless of a criminal record. It is hard to see how “more room to decide” can be understood other than wishing to depart from this universal and unconditional prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.

The successive interpretation of Article 3 ECHR in the field of migration

In defense of the lettera aperta and in other criticism of the Court, the argument is sometimes made that the jurisprudence in the field of migration has been expansive. Common knowledge about the Article 3 ECHR case law is that protection against expulsion goes back to the Soering case from 1989. Soering, a German national, was facing extradition from the UK to the USA for charges of murder. The ECtHR ruled that the potential exposure to death row would constitute inhuman or degrading treatment and that the Convention therefore prohibited an extradition. With this ruling, the Court made clear that Article 3 prohibits delivering persons under the jurisdiction of a Convention state to another state where the person faces torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The scope of the prohibition extends beyond direct acts of the state – which is also recognized for scenarios in which the state is responsible if it fails to prevent attacks from non-state actors.

Soering was not a case of migrants’ rights, but it created the ground for Article 3 ECHR jurisprudence regarding expulsions. It should not be surprising that this jurisprudence began several years after the Convention entered into force. Firstly, the Court did not hear many cases during the existence of the European Commission of Human Rights. Secondly, the late 1980s and early 1990s were the period in migrants’ rights gained a practical relevance as defense against the “emerging politics of non-entrée” (Hathaway 1992). During the 1990s, a few cases followed in which the Court interpreted the protection against expulsion under Article 3 ECHR.

The first case after Soering was the case Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden (1991). It concerned a Chilean family of three who had applied for political asylum in Sweden. Their claim had been rejected and they faced expulsion, when the case was brought before the ECtHR. The Court confirmed that Article 3 ECHR is applicable in expulsion cases, but did not find a violation, arguing that there was not sufficient evidence that the applicants faced torture or inhuman or degrading treatment if deported. Judge de Meyer dissented with the majority and suggested that Article 3 ECHR had been violated, relying also on the general situation in Chile in 1989.

In another decision from 1991, in the case Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, the Court equally confirmed the applicability of Article 3 ECHR to asylum seekers while finding no violation. The applicants were Tamils who had fled Sri Lanka and applied for protection in the UK. The ECtHR held that the situation they faced when returned did not meet the threshold of Article 3 ECHR, with Judge Russo dissenting.

The next decision about protection against expulsion was in the case Chahal v. the United Kingdom in 1996. It concerned a family of four, the parents being Indian citizens and the adult children being British citizens. The parents had been in the UK since 1974 and 1975, and the father, Mr. Chahal, was a leading figure in the Sikh community. He had been charged for terrorist activities but not convicted; nonetheless, a deportation order was based on the fight against terrorism. The Court, sitting as the Grand Chamber, held that the deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 ECHR because as a politically active Sikh, Mr. Chahal, would face inhuman or degrading treatment in India.

After this first decision in which a violation of Article 3 ECHR prohibited a deportation, an inadmissibility decision followed in the case T.I. v. the United Kingdom in 2000. The applicant was a Sri Lankan national to be removed from the UK to Germany. The Court held that the removal order from the UK without consideration of the asylum claim in substance did not give rise to an admissible claim under Article 3 ECHR because the applicant would be able to again claim asylum in Germany and did not risk immediate removal to Sri Lanka.

In Saadi v. Italy (2008), the ECtHR, sitting as Grand Chamber, held that the expulsion of Mr. Saadi, a Tunisian national, would violate Article 3 ECHR because of the risk of torture in Tunisia. Mr. Saadi had been prosecuted and jailed in Italy. The Italian government had sought assurances from Tunisia that he would not face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Such assurance was not given and the Court stressed that even if given, this would not have been sufficient alone because Italy had to assess the risk of a violation of Article 3 ECHR based on all available facts.

Returning to – when?

When I read the call for “more room” to decide nationally about the expulsion of criminal foreign nationals, I wonder if the authors mean that they disagree with the ruling in the Saadi case, and I would like to hear why and how they think the case should have been decided. When I hear a colleague suggest we should return to an earlier state of interpretation of Article 3 in the area of migration, I wonder to which state and why? The Court did not “invent” the protection against deporting someone to conditions of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment with Soering, nor did it invent it with Chahal or with Saadi. The Court interpreted the Convention. One can disagree with the interpretation but that would require some doctrinal legal arguments. Criticism of the Court’s jurisprudence should have some basis in the Convention’s text and rules of interpretation.

Judicial decisions are not taken in a political vacuum, but they also cannot be reduced to political choices. If political leaders try to reduce them to such, there should be collective resistance of all who believe in the worth of an independent judiciary.

And yes, there can be reasonable disagreement about legal interpretations. But we can only have a viable discussion based on concrete cases and interpretative alternatives, not based on abstract calls for a “more restrictive approach”. Do those calls refer to protection against deportation in cases of severe illness? Do they disagree with the ruling in case D. v. the UK (1997)? Did they notice the restrictive decisions in the cases B.B. v. France (1998) and N. v. the UK (2008)? Does the disagreement begin with later decisions in Paposhvili or Savran, and if so why?

Silent threats to the Convention’s health

Besides the open threats to the Convention, there is also the more silent disregard of the Convention’s requirements and the Court’s rulings. The ECtHR continuously holds states such as Hungary and Greece accountable for the violations of migrants’ rights, in particular due to arbitrary detention and due to inhuman and degrading treatment in camps. The numerous decisions per year do not make headlines, they do not advance new interpretations but simply apply, again and again, the Convention’s standards against state actions that violate them. I have written before about the problem of this disregard for the ECHR requirements. The Court cannot resolve this problem, it requires a broad coalition of legal and political institutions as well as civil society that uphold pressure for the Convention to be respected. This broad coalition is the Convention’s immune system.

The 75th anniversary is a helpful occasion to recall these urgent contributions we can all make to protect the European Convention on Human Rights: reaffirm the universality of its guarantees, rebut attacks on judicial independence and call for respect of the Convention, pressing states to address structural violations.",https://www.ein.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/immigration_word.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 10:57:36.900712

Sue Tincher said she heard ICE was conducting an operation in her neighborhood around 6:30 in the morning. She said she was an observer and wanted to find out what was going on. When she asked what the agents were doing, she said she was told to stand back. She didn't, and was detained.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security began what they called ""Operation Metro Surge."" Twelve people were taken into custody during the operation, DHS said. There have been continued reports since then of ICE in the Twin Cities, including in Burnsville, where family members told KARE 11 ICE detained four people over the weekend.

ICE posted on social media Tuesday a video showing of multiple arrests, with the caption ""Minnesota's weather is cloudy with a 100% chance of ICE.""

The Northside Residents Redevelopment Council says three others were detained in the raid at which Tincher was detained. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not commented publicly on this incident.

Tincher said when she was detained, she was pushed down into the snow and put into an unmarked vehicle as she yelled for help. She said she was taken to the Whipple Federal Building and held for four hours.

Her husband, Jim Tincher, told media he didn't know where they took his wife. He said he called city councilors, Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Sen. Tina Smith for help. He said he never found out where she was until she called him.

""I knew she would come back, a lot of families don't know what,"" Jim Tincher said.

When asked if she would continue being an ICE observer, Sue Tincher said yes.

The bill aims to improve conditions and oversight at immigrant detention facilities, including at Camp East Montana in El Paso.

Key provisions in the bill require establishing minimum civil detention standards and allowing unannounced congressional inspections.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar has joined forces with other congressional leaders in an attempt to establish ""crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections"" for the thousands of immigrants being held in public and private detention facilities.

Escobar is a co-sponsor of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act that looks to improve conditions within immigrant detention facilities across the country — including one of the largest lockups in El Paso.

The bill aims to improve congressional oversight of the sites, which have seen increasing accusations of human rights violations and inhumane conditions.

Key provisions in the bill would give members of Congress access to detention facilities for unannounced inspections and establish civil detention standards that match or exceed the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards.

The bill was presented by its authors U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Adam Smith, both Democrats from Washington state, on Dec. 3.

“I have seen firsthand the consequences of incompetence, cruelty and inhumane treatment that flourishes when private prison corporations are allowed to profit off suffering, including at Camp East Montana,” Escobar, D-El Paso, said in a statement. “The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act is an urgent and necessary step toward ending such abuse that’s central to the Trump administration. I’m grateful to Representatives Jayapal and Smith for introducing this bill which establishes crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections that this administration has systematically dismantled.”

There are 123 co-sponsors. It is also endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Haitian Bridge Alliance and Refugees International, among many others immigrant advocacy groups.

The bill would:

Repeal mandatory detention

Prohibit the detention of families and children in family detention

Create a presumption of release and impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, survivors of torture or gender-based violence, people with serious mental or physical illness or disability, LGBTQ individuals, asylum seekers, and people over age 60

Phase out the use of private detention facilities and jails over a three-year period

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards that provide, at minimum, the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards

Mandate the DHS Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections with meaningful penalties for failure to comply with standards

Require DHS to admit members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

“People are being held in squalor, largely in private, for-profit detention facilities, all to pad the bottom lines of prison corporations that donate to Donald Trump and Republicans,"" Jayapal said announcing the act. ""As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse. We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.”

There are currently nearly 70,000 people detained across the U.S., the majority of whom have no criminal convictions.

The legislative measure comes as Escobar and other immigrants rights advocates have raised grave concern over the conditions within immigration detention facilities.

The ICE immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss is at the center of the controversy.

Congressional concern over the Camp East Montana detention center

Escobar has continued to express her concern about the conditions at the Camp East Montana immigration detention facility, which ICE opened on land that belongs to Fort Bliss Army Post.

She has carried out three oversight visits to the facility since it began receiving detained migrants on Aug. 1, and sent at least two letters to the Department of Homeland Security over concerns about the conditions in the facility. Her concerns include inadequate medical attention — with detainees not receiving their medication — unsanitary conditions where detainees have requested equipment to clean their spaces, and poor quality to rotten food.

Escobar sent a letter to Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, in November expressing her concerns about the facility. She stated then that ""conditions at Camp East Montana are dangerous and inhumane.""

The congresswoman made her latest visit to the facility on Dec. 1. She found that many of the issues that she discovered during her earlier visits have not been addressed.

""Not only is there no process being made on the issues I have raised,"" Escobar told the El Paso Times. ""But it is clear to me that the contractors are either cutting corners to create bigger profit for themselves or that the contractors are not competent.""

The facility is set to be the largest in the country, ultimately housing 5,000 detainees. The Trump administration granted over $1.2 billion dollars for its construction.

There are currently about 3,000 people detained at the immigration detention facility, Escobar said. And many of the immigrants detained at the El Paso immigration are being taken directly to the sprawling detention camp following their hearings, court observers said.

During her last visit, Escobar was able to speak with 10 women in the facility.

Escobar detailed that she has consistently heard that detainees are being forced to wash their own clothes, they are not being provided with adequate hygiene products and detainees have continued to receive food that is either foul tasting or rotten. The women she spoke with also reported having developed rashes due to the alcohol-based gel they have used to wash their clothing.

Escobar noted that some immigrants she has spoken with have been detained for nearly two months. Originally, the facility was meant to hold immigrants for up to five days.

""These are human beings who deserve to be treated as human beings,"" the congresswoman said. ""Even if there are people who do not care about the humanitarian component of my concerns, then why should be outraged that a contractor that is getting $1.24 billion dollars of taxpayer money is not meeting the obligations that they should be meeting.""

Calls to shut down Camp East Montana

The ACLU and other immigrant rights advocacy groups, including El Paso's Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Estrella del Paso, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement urging officials to cease detaining immigrants in the soft-sided detention facility.

Detainees held in the facility have told lawyers about the squalid conditions and human rights violations in the camps, the ACLU reports. The letter details the horrid conditions in the facility, including ""beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations.""

The letter recounts the story of four Cuban immigrants held in the facility who reported being beaten by guards after refusing to be deported to Mexico. It also recounts the experience of one detainee, Samuel, who had his ""testicles crushed"" by a guard and was beaten to the point where he was taken in an ambulance from the facility.

The ACLU letter is the latest in a series of reports highlighting the dire conditions at the facility. It echoes and cites similar concerns Escobar has expressed and internal ICE inspectors reports of violations.

The Washington Post reported in September that the detention facility was found to have no less than 60 violations in 50 days as the Trump administration expands the facility. Detainees were subjected to conditions that violated federal standards for immigrant detention, according to a report produced by ICE inspectors.

Inspectors found the facility failed to properly monitor and treat some detainees’ medical conditions, lacked basic procedures for keeping guards and detainees safe and inadequately provided detainees with proper means to communicate with legal representation.","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PTX1/85714710007-180820256-d-8-a-6521.jpg?crop=5759,3241,x0,y299&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 10:57:40.241448

Currently, the ESTA website does not require a separate photo upload and the ESTA Mobile application only requires the photo in certain instances.
ESTA application website decommission; ESTA Mobile as sole application option.
Ultimately, CBP plans to require ESTA applicants to submit applications solely through the ESTA Mobile application and will decommission the ESTA application website.","U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is planning to make several changes to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application process used by business visitors and tourists to visit the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including the addition of a social media review and the requirement to provide greater detail on the applicant’s personal information and family members.

The intended changes are detailed in a CBP notice set for publication in the Federal Register (FR) on December 10. The public has 60 days from FR publication to comment on the planned changes, which also include the plan for a new optional mobile tool for any foreign national to record their departure from the United States.

According to the FR notice, CBP is planning the following changes to the ESTA application process:

Mandatory social media information collection. CBP is planning to add social media as a mandatory data element for an ESTA application and will require applicants to provide their social media information from the five years preceding their application.

Additional required personal information. CBP intends to add several data fields to the ESTA application “when feasible,” including:

Telephone numbers used by applicant in the preceding five years;

Email addresses used by applicant in the preceding ten years;

IP addresses and metadata from electronically submitted photos;

Family member names (parents, spouse, siblings, children) and dates and places of birth;

Family telephone numbers used in the preceding five years;

Family member residences;

Biometrics – face, fingerprint, DNA, and iris;

Business telephone numbers used by the applicant in the preceding five years; and

Business email addresses used by the applicant in the preceding ten years.

Separate photo upload requirement. CBP is planning to update the ESTA website and ESTA mobile application to always require the upload of a photograph of the applicant’s face, in addition to the photo of the passport biographical page. Currently, the ESTA website does not require a separate photo upload and the ESTA Mobile application only requires the photo in certain instances.

ESTA application website decommission; ESTA Mobile as sole application option. Ultimately, CBP plans to require ESTA applicants to submit applications solely through the ESTA Mobile application and will decommission the ESTA application website. The ESTA website would remain available as an information resource for the VWP program and as a tool for ESTA applicants to check the status of their submitted ESTA applications, but applicants would be required to use the ESTA Mobile application to apply for ESTA. CBP cites certain technological limitations of the ESTA website as the basis for the planned change.

Apart from the ESTA changes, CBP also plans to implement an optional new functionality within the CBP Home mobile application that would allow foreign nationals to provide evidence of their departure from the United States. If a foreign national chooses to record their departure through the mobile application, they will be required to submit their facial image and CBP will use geolocation services to confirm that the foreign national is outside the United States. The agency will also run “liveness detection” software on the uploaded facial image to determine that the photo is a live photo as opposed to a previously uploaded one. If a foreign national chooses to submit evidence of their departure, the report of the exit would be recorded as a confirmed departure in the CBP Arrival and Departure System (ADIS).

CBP will accept public comments on the planned ESTA and departure record changes for 60 days after publication in the December 10 Federal Register notice. If the changes are then approved by the Office of Management and Budget, CBP may implement the changes in stages over the following weeks and months.

ESTA applicants should be aware that if these changes are finalized, they would be asked for a higher level of personal detail in future applications and become subject to a social media review by CBP. The increase in data collection could also mean that ESTA applicants would face an increased likelihood of being flagged for closer scrutiny and/or would experience longer waits for ESTA approval.

The chief of the body which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) said ministers had taken an “important first step forward together” to agree a political declaration on migration and the ECHR.
He said: “This is really the starting of a process on a consensus basis... “All 46 member states have reaffirmed their deep and abiding commitment to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.
The ECHR, which underpins Britain’s Human Rights Act, is seen by its critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants from the country.
“Human rights were never meant to be optional or reserved for comfortable and secure times.","The prime minister has urged Europe’s leaders to reform how a major human rights treaty is interpreted in law to tackle illegal migration and prevent voters from turning to “the forces that seek to divide us"".

Sir Keir Starmer and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, have made a joint call on other leaders across the continent to agree on a “modernisation” of how the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is interpreted in their countries’ laws.

European ministers agreed at a meeting in Strasbourg on Wednesday that they will look at how to tackle concerns over migration within the legal framework.

Deputy PM David Lammy, who is at the meeting, said the convention ""was never intended to be frozen in time,"" and warned that the definition of ""family life"" should not be stretched ""to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country”.

The chief of the body which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) said ministers had taken an “important first step forward together” to agree a political declaration on migration and the ECHR.

Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Berset told reporters that the “living instrument” is possible to adapt, and work will begin to adopt the declaration in Moldova in May 2026.

He said: “This is really the starting of a process on a consensus basis...

“All 46 member states have reaffirmed their deep and abiding commitment to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.

“This is not rhetoric. This is a political decision of the highest order.

“But ministers have also expressed their concerns regarding the unprecedented challenges posed by migration and the serious questions governments face in maintaining societies that deliver for citizens.”

In an opinion piece for the Guardian newspaper, Starmer and Frederiksen advocated for a tougher approach to policing Europe’s borders as a means of winning against populist political opponents, saying they were “making this case across Europe”.

The ECHR, which underpins Britain’s Human Rights Act, is seen by its critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants from the country.

The right to family life, enshrined by Article 8 of the agreement, is often used as grounds in legal cases to prevent removals.

The Home Office has also said it has seen a trend of Article 3 rights, prohibiting torture, being used to halt deportations because of claims that migrants’ healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Starmer’s political opponents, the Conservatives and Reform UK, have both said they would leave the ECHR if in power.

The prime minister, in his joint op-ed with Fredriksen, acknowledged the “current asylum framework was created for another era”, adding: “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed, and asylum systems must change with it.”

Despite opponents' stated intention to leave the ECHR, Starmer's government has insisted it will remain a member of the treaty, and has adopted a series of hardline immigration measures, modelled on those spearheaded by Frederiksen’s Danish government.

“Migration must be orderly, managed and sustainable. Irregular routes should not be the go-to option – so we must dismantle the human smuggling networks that prey on desperation.

“Together, we are calling on our friends across Europe to go further in tackling these shared challenges,” the two leaders wrote.

They continued, describing a “push for a modernisation of the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights – so that the convention system, which we believe in, can evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.”

In a warning to other leaders, Starmer and Fredriksen added: “Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.

“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”

The Government is expected to bring forward homegrown legislation to change how the Article 8 right to family life is interpreted in UK courts, and is also considering examining the threshold for Article 3 rights.

Amnesty International UK hit out at UK plans to lead reforms of the ECHR, describing it as weakening protections.

Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “There is a dreadful irony in our Justice Secretary working with his counterparts to remove or reduce rights on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

""It shows how far we have drifted from the moral resolve of the last century, when our grandparents determined that the fact we are all born free and equal must be protected in law.

“Human rights were never meant to be optional or reserved for comfortable and secure times. They were designed to be a compass, our conscience, when the politics of fear and division try to steer us wrong.

""To weaken ECHR protections now, on a day meant to reaffirm dignity and protection for all, is not reform. It is moral retreat.”

Elsewhere, French far-right leader Jordan Bardella told the Daily Telegraph newspaper he would rewrite French border policy to allow British patrol boats to push back migrant dinghies into France’s waters, if he led the country.

At issue is Senate Bill 76 — authored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, after she blocked a bill with some similar provisions during the last legislative session. That move resulted in Rokita claiming she did so because she has an “illegal alien” in her family.

Her current proposal includes language allowing state agencies and Rokita’s office to investigate the “employment of an unauthorized alien” and report possible violations to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Indiana Department of Labor.

Rokita, however, is backing a differing proposal in Senate Bill 122, which would give the attorney general’s office authority to seek court orders suspending an “employer’s operating authorizations” over such suspected violations.

Rokita, a Republican, blasted Brown on social media over her bill, saying she had “introduced a watered-down, bizarro world version … that takes all the enforcement teeth out of the bill. That makes her bill meaningless.”

Brown countered that she has worked with entities from the Trump administration to county sheriffs in order to find effective ways to help enforce federal immigration laws.

“The biggest thing is making sure that we didn’t grow government and that the power isn’t centered in one agency or individual,” Brown told reporters.

Hiring practices in question

Erin Tuttle, the attorney general office’s legislative director, criticized Brown’s bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally.

“The Supreme Court has confirmed that states may sanction the license of employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers,” Tuttle said. “If Indiana refuses to adopt the one enforcement mechanism available under federal law, it cannot credibly claim to be a leader in combating illegal immigration.”

Immigrant advocates, however, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation.

Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, told committee members that the proposal encourages racial profiling by businesses.

“It pushes them toward discriminatory hiring practices, meaning someone who fits a certain look or has a certain name or has an accent may be discriminated against, just out of precaution,” Castoreno said. “We know who is harmed, people with brown skin, people with accents, people with names that sound unfamiliar to an HR manager.”

Committee members voted 6-2 along party lines to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in early January.

Rokita-Brown conflict continues

The dispute between Rokita and Brown over the legislation grows out of their conflict over an immigration-enforcement bill from the legislative session earlier this year.

House members approved House Bill 1531 in February, but Brown did not hold a Senate committee hearing on the bill and it died when the legislative session ended in April.

Rokita then claimed Brown had blocked the legislation because she had a “family member who’s an illegal alien.”

Brown called that claim “blatantly false.” She also filed an attorney misconduct grievance over Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission that she said Tuesday was still pending.

Rokita and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over last session’s bill.

They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a Republican primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.

Following the committee vote, Rokita posted to X that the bill “would actively shield sanctuary jurisdictions and directly undermines our ongoing lawsuits to end sanctuary policies in Monroe and St. Joseph counties. We need to stop illegal immigration—not protect the counties and officials who defy state law and put Hoosier families last.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/D098C92B-C8DB-492D-AAE5-016023084083_1_201_a-2048x1364.jpeg,N,,2025-12-10 09:57:19.452017

The U.S. human rights record has been far from spotless, but under President Donald Trump, attacks on human rights at home and abroad have escalated on an alarming scale.

The Trump administration may dismiss them, but we will not. Across the country, millions of people are demanding accountability and respect for human rights. Their courage is a reminder that we must never normalize this assault.

Authoritarian Practices, Eroded Rights

Since President Trump took office, authoritarian practices and contempt for the rule of law have surged dramatically. His administration has targeted universities—crushing student protests and threatening academic freedom. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester and negotiator at Columbia University detained for months before a judge ordered his release, still faces ongoing immigration proceedings. His only “offense” was exercising his right to freedom of expression. Targeting and threatening peaceful protesters and their immigration status is a clear violation of human rights. This administration’s message is unmistakable: dissent, and you risk punishment, detention or deportation.

Khalil’s case is not unique. At least 10 international students and activists have faced similar targeting for Palestinian rights advocacy, including Leqaa Kordia, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman detained since March 13, 2025, after a protest at Columbia University. She must be released immediately.

Journalists have also been targeted. Reporter Mario Guevara, detained in June for covering a protest in Georgia, was deported in October. This sends a chilling message to every journalist in the United States: reporting the truth can get you jailed or thrown out of this country.

Immigrants are being detained without warrants or due process, at historic levels in inhumane and cruel conditions. I recently met with lawyers and people previously detained in the Everglades Detention Facility, known as “Alligator Alcatraz” who shared devastating reports of torture, denial of medical care and inhumane conditions without access to attorneys. At a visit to the Krome North Service Processing Center, another immigrant detention center in Florida, I saw these conditions with my owns eyes and spoke to people detained who said they’ve “lived through hell.”

Militarized forces have taken over city streets—especially threatening to brown and Black communities—even as local officials and some federal judges demanded President Trump stop. Masked federal officers have conducted nighttime raids, terrorizing entire neighborhoods and taking people without warrants. Children are torn from their parents, and people who have come to our border seeking safety are denied their right to seek asylum.People who have protested these heavy-handed enforcement tactics are met with law enforcement in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets.

These are not policy disputes—they are human rights violations.

President Trump is trying to silence dissent by invoking fear everywhere. I was one of the 7 million people protesting in October refusing to give up our rights. We, the people mobilizing to defend our rights, are growing in number and power!

Human Rights Transcend Politics

Human rights are not about left or right. They’re about right and wrong. They protect the human dignity and safety of every person. If we stay silent as rights are violated and denied, the question isn’t ifmore violations will follow, but when.

Now is the time for collective action. We are in this together. We inspire each other by protesting, speaking out and joining local movements that defend those whose rights are being violated. Colleges and universities must safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment. Lawmakers must hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. The United States must also reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems.

The adoption of the UDHR on December 10, 1948, recognized human rights as the foundation for freedom, justice and peace. All people everywhere have a right to live their lives freely, equally and in dignity. We can, and we must, do better. The path forward begins with accountability, courage and collective action—from those who lead our government and from each of us. On this day, and every day, let us raise our voices and demand that the United States do what is right.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.","President Trump’s promised executive order that would kneecap state laws aimed at regulating artificial intelligence is likely bound for the courts.

The president announced his plan Monday to create “one rulebook” by which the tech industry will abide when it comes to AI, a move that would override the regulations passed by individual states.

“We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS!” he continued. “AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!”

But it could face legal headwinds and criticism off the bat, especially as AI regulation is still a fledgling effort.

“A great federal system could be better, in theory,” said Nicholas E. Stewart, executive director of the Justice Education Project. “But in practice, without a system in place, states are only really the ones filling the gaps.”

All 50 states — plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands — introduced legislation this year on AI, and some 38 states adopted or enacted about 100 measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

That patchwork of state laws could come under fire with an executive order from Trump.

Though it’s not clear what the final order will look like, a draft order seen last month by our colleague, tech reporter extraordinaire Julia Shapero, would have created a task force dedicated to challenging state AI laws and restricted certain broadband funding for states with AI laws deemed overly burdensome.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who last week proposed an AI “bill of rights” for his state, wrote on X Monday that any effort by the president to “preempt” states’ actions by overriding their laws — as Trump’s post seems to suggest — would be unlawful.

“An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action,” DeSantis said, responding to a post urging the state to challenge Trump’s would-be executive order. “Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation.”

Either way, legal challenges seem inevitable — and the Trump administration could quickly run into issues.

There’s one big problem to start: At least one of the tech companies that might celebrate lesser regulation, OpenAI, has acknowledged that “federal preemption over existing or prospective state laws will require an act of Congress.”

The admission came in the footnote of a submission to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy and could be used by legal challengers to undermine the foundation and authority of Trump’s efforts.

More generally, as DeSantis noted, an order overwriting state laws could pose questions about the separation of powers between both Congress and the executive branch, and strains on federalism.

Federal lawmakers last week did reintroduce the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act, which aims to bar companies from using “biased and discriminatory AI-powered algorithms” in making “critical decisions” for American lives.

But the regulation of AI is still in early stages, and efforts to crack down on emergent technology have major gaps. That’s especially true of regulation of AI’s impact on the justice system, according to Stewart.

Stewart, lead author of the book “Next Steps into Criminal Justice Activism: Technology, Ethics, and the Future of Justice,” which publishes next Tuesday, told The Gavel in an interview that AI is already built into every stage of policing, which prosecutors now use to build timelines, case theories and arguments as opposed to human witnesses.

“Policing and prosecution are being quietly rewritten by systems that don’t think, can’t explain themselves and are not accountable to anyone,” Stewart said. “And when you remove people from key decisions, handing those decisions to generative AI, you don’t get neutrality — you get automation of the same biases and power imbalances that already exist, except they’re only faster, quieter and harder to challenge.”

The book, which was shaped by the Gen Z-led Justice Education Project, includes chapters dedicated to interviews with legal experts at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania detailing the dangers of leaving AI’s spread into the legal system unaddressed, especially for communities already disproportionately affected by heavy policing.

Columbia University professor Daniel Richman — who, loyal readers may know just-so-happens to play a key role in the Justice Department’s dismissed case against former FBI Director James Comey — told the authors in one chapter, shared with The Gavel ahead of publication, that an “invisible system” like these can inflict harm just as well, with fewer questions asked.

“Anytime you expand data collection, you risk widening the net of the criminal justice system,” Richman said.

(We’d be remiss not to mention: Richman’s bid to temporarily block DOJ from accessing his own data, which prosecutors relied on to argue he was authorized by Comey to make disclosures to the media, was on Saturday granted by a judge.)

Stewart said that Trump’s executive order would amount to a federal takeover of AI regulation before there’s a comprehensive federal standard in place.

“So, as the administration moves ahead, we can see the strongest state-level safeguards — especially around discrimination, privacy and surveillance — overridden overnight, potentially,” he said. “And that would shift enormous power to Washington and to the tech companies building these systems (in) Silicon Valley, leaving communities with fewer tools to challenge harmful uses of AI in the justice system.”

IN FOCUS

Trump hits wall with US attorneys

Trump’s bid to install loyalist U.S. attorneys in top offices nationwide seems to have hit a dead end, as his Justice Department’s efforts to keep embattled prosecutors in their positions have faltered.

“It’s a very sad situation,” the president said Monday. “We’re losing a lot of great people.”

His remarks came after his former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, stepped down as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey after a panel of federal appeals court judges ruled she was unlawfully serving in the role.

Habba was the first of his loyalist U.S. attorneys to be ruled disqualified in July, but others followed.

The top federal prosecutors in Nevada, the California district including Los Angeles and the Virginia district that includes D.C.’s suburbs have all since been found to be unlawfully holding their posts, while a challenge to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York is pending — and a judge signaled it’s one the federal prosecutor may lose.

Trump’s Justice Department has taken extensive steps to keep these attorneys in their roles, but Habba’s resignation marks a reality check for the administration.

Habba said in her announcement that the decision was to protect the “stability and integrity” of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, saying judges stopped holding trials and handing down sentences with her at the helm, “leaving violent criminals on the streets.”

Court watchers have largely attributed the disruptions to confusion around the legality of her leadership, but the consequences have been real. The New York Times reported in August that the delays were wreaking havoc on the lives of those whose lives were tied up in New Jersey’s federal courts, and the appeals court ruling came only on Dec. 1.

A similar story is playing out in the Eastern District of Virginia, where the name of Lindsey Halligan — the disqualified U.S. attorney — is still appearing on court filings.

Several outlets have reported judges pushing back from the bench, questioning why a federal judge’s ruling that found Halligan never lawfully served as the district’s top prosecutor would not preclude her participation in cases.

One of those judges, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, oversaw Comey’s case at the trial level and Halligan’s disqualification was the reason for its dismissal. He ordered her name struck from a different man’s case records and said he was finding it “difficult to reconcile” the disqualification ruling with the Justice Department’s actions now, according to CNN.

The Justice Department hit back Monday in a joint statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that said certain district and magistrate judges in Halligan’s district were pursing an “unconscionable campaign of bias and hostility” against her and her line prosecutors.

“Lindsey and our attorneys are simply doing their jobs: advocating for the Department of Justice’s positions while following guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel,” the No. 1 and 2 DOJ officials said. “They do not deserve to have their reputations questioned in court for ethically advocating on behalf of their client.”

On Tuesday, a judge suggested at a hearing that Halligan should take a page out of Habba’s book and relinquish her role. Pointing out her resignation, Judge Leonie Brinkeman said, “that’s the proper position, in my view,” according to the Times.

The Justice Department has not appealed Halligan’s dismissal, keeping her in the role, nonetheless. It’s not clear how far DOJ will take any of the U.S. attorney disqualifications, after dismissing Habba’s case before it could reach the Supreme Court.

But the calculus could involve efforts to reindict Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), the two Trump foes Halligan was hand-picked to pursue charges against in the first place.

The bigger problem, identified by Trump, is the excessive stalling of Senate confirmation for his nominees, bumping their tenure out of the interim window where many initially served lawfully before the legality of their leadership came into question upon its expiration.

On Monday, the president blamed the Senate’s long-standing blue slip tradition that lets lets home-state senators veto presidential nominees to district courts and U.S. attorney offices.

Trump vowed in August that he’d sue over the practice, but such a lawsuit against what the president has called a “gentleman’s agreement” would face long odds and never came to fruition.

Boasberg v. Noem

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has his eye on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as the judge weighs potential criminal contempt referrals.

Boasberg oversees one of the highest-profile challenges to Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to a Salvadoran megaprison.

Nearly nine months after Trump first invoked the law to quickly launch deportation flights, the case has returned to Boasberg’s court, and he’s resuming his contempt inquiry.

Noem has taken center stage upon the Justice Department disclosing for the first time that she made the final decision not to turn around planes as Boasberg handed down an oral and subsequent written order to do so on the night of March 15.

“I made the decision to continue the transfer of custody of the Alien Enemies Act detainees,” Noem, under penalty of perjury, reaffirmed in a declaration submitted Friday.

The Trump administration maintains it didn’t violate Boasberg’s directive because the flights were already out of U.S. airspace by that time.

Months ago, Boasberg disagreed, but he has yet to identify any specific officials responsible. He’s now weighing whether to refer any of them for criminal prosecution.

As the Obama-appointed judge mulls next steps, the government’s latest court filings provide the clearest picture yet of how Noem came to her decision.

Blanche and Emil Bove, the then-principal associate deputy attorney general whom Trump later tapped for a federal appeals judgeship, in sworn declarations told Boasberg they had analyzed the judge’s statements that March night.

The duo said they advised the Department of Homeland Security’s acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara. Mazzara, in turn, advised Noem, he confirmed in a sworn declaration of his own.

None of the officials disclosed what the advice was, calling it privileged material.

What’s next? Boasberg wants to hear from witnesses.

The judge asked that Erez Reuveni appear on Monday. Reuveni worked in the Justice Department this spring and has become a whistleblower, accusing top officials of ignoring court orders.

Reuveni has said Bove suggested government attorneys may need to tell the courts “f‑‑‑ you” and defy any order blocking Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. Bove denies Reuveni’s account.

Reuveni now works at Democracy Forward, a left-leaning legal organization that prolifically challenges the Trump administration in court.

After Reuveni testifies, Boasberg ordered the government to produce Drew Ensign, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation, for Tuesday.

Boasberg has said he’s obligated to consider three factors to determine if an official should be referred for criminal contempt: (1) his order was “clear and reasonably specific”; (2) “the defendant violated the order”; and (3) “the violation was willful.”

Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are stepping up their scrutiny of the judge.

Six GOP senators — Eric Schmitt (Mo.), Mike Lee (Utah), Tommy Tuberville (Ala.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) — sent a letter last month to the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit urging him to suspend Boasberg.

It comes as some in the party hope to impeach the judge. Boasberg has also drawn Republicans’ ire for signing orders barring phone providers from telling lawmakers that Special Counsel Jack Smith was searching their records and comments Boasberg reportedly made at a closed-door meeting of federal judges.

Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee was set to hold a hearing on “rogue judges” and impeachment. It was postponed.

Chicago use-of-force case fizzling

The class-action lawsuit that sparked an expansive order restricting immigration agents’ use of force in the Chicago area is fizzling out.

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has shifted his focus from Chicago to Charlotte. It left the plaintiffs declaring victory and a push to drop their lawsuit that garnered national attention.

Not so fast, however.

“This is transparent procedural gamesmanship,” the Justice Department pushed back in court filings Thursday. “To be sure, if Plaintiffs want to stop litigating and this Court grants their motion for dismissal with prejudice, that is beyond Defendants’ control.”

“But this gambit should be seen for what it is.”

The judge is expected to grant the dismissal “with prejudice,” meaning it would prevent them from bringing substantially similar claims in the future.

The Justice Department wants that to be air-tight, insisting journalists, protesters and clergy members can’t file lawsuits claiming new constitutional violations by immigration agents.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee who oversees the case, hasn’t yet granted the dismissal request after holding a hearing last week. Ellis reportedly wants to give any class members an opportunity to object before ruling.

Already, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times have told Ellis that before ruling, she should first ensure the government produces various documents to the press and public related to the case.

Some have already been turned over, but others haven’t as the government works to make redactions.

“A dismissal should not derail the right of the public and the press to access the materials that the parties submitted to the Court and that the Court has already determined are a part of the public record in this case,” the outlets wrote in court filings Thursday.

SIDEBAR

5 top docket updates

Habba out: Alina Habba, the former personal lawyer to Trump, stepped down from her contested position atop the federal prosecuting office in New Jersey after federal courts ruled she was unlawfully appointed. She said she’ll take on a new DOJ role as a senior advisor to Attorney General Pam Bondi for U.S. Attorneys.

SCOTUS OKs Texas map: The Supreme Court in an emergency ruling enabled Texas to use its congressional map for the midterms that adds up to five GOP pickups and ignited a mid-decade restricting war. The court’s liberal justices publicly dissented.

Jan. 6 pipe bomb arrest: Brian Cole Jr., the Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican national committee offices on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, was arrested and made his first court appearance, unraveling one of the longest lasting mysteries from those days.

James no bill: The Justice Department failed to secure a new indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) after its initial case against her was dismissed, a blunder for prosecutors who have trained their sights on the Trump adversary.

New SCOTUS emergency case: The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute involving immigration judges’ free speech rights. The dispute raises significant implications for lawsuits filed by federal employees. It’s the administration’s 32nd emergency appeal since taking office.

In other news

Privileged behavior: Trump personally asserted executive privilege to keep thousands of documents out of discovery in a long-lasting civil case stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. See his unmistakable signature yourself in the court filings here.

Stay a while: In an exclusive interview with Politico, Trump said he hopes Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas stay on the bench, a response to calls for the 70-somethings to retire so the president could appoint new conservative justices.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Birthright citizenship

Last week, we previewed six petitions to keep an eye on. The court took up four of them.

The headliner is Trump v. Barbara, the battle over the constitutionality of Trump’s birthright citizenship restrictions (for real, this time).

The justices also agreed to hear Abouammo v. United States, an appeal brought by a former Twitter manager accused or providing information to an associate of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince is Mohammed bin Salman about Saudi dissidents. Defendant Ahmad Abouammo argues he was convicted in the wrong venue.

The court also took up T.M. v. University of Maryland Medical System, which implicates the scope of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. The doctrine prohibits federal district judges from considering cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by a final state court decision.

And finally, the court agreed to hear Jules v. Andre Balazs Properties. The dispute stems from discrimination claims a security guard brought against Chateau Marmont, a historic Hollywood hotel known for its celebrity guests. At issue before the high court is a thorny jurisdiction issue.

OUT: Book ban challenge

The court declined to hear Little v. Llano County, Texas, a challenge to the county public library removing 17 books from its shelves.

A district judge found the removals were motivated by a desire to censor certain viewpoints. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed those claims, saying that public library patrons had no right to challenge the removals under the First Amendment.

The patrons had asked the high court to take up their appeal.

They were represented by Elizabeth Prelogar, former President Biden’s solicitor general. It was one of her first petitions she brought to the Supreme Court since returning to private practice at the law firm Cooley.

MAYBE: Vaccine mandates

The Supreme Court asked the Trump administration to weigh in on whether to take up three pending petitions.

The first, Does 1-2 v. Hochul, involves a challenge to New York’s COVID-era vaccine mandate for health care workers. They are raising claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The second, Crowther v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, is a major dispute over Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded schools. The petition, brought by Georgia Tech’s former women’s basketball coach and another employee, concerns if school employees have the right to bring Title IX lawsuits.

And the third, Hoffman v. WBI Energy Transmission, concerns eminent domain. The Natural Gas Act delegates that constitutional authority to condemn property to private companies so they can construct federally funded pipelines. The case involves how “just compensation” to property owners should be calculated in those cases.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

Gun rights: Last week, we highlighted the dozens of challenges to the federal crime for felons possessing firearms. No action yet, but we hope you held your beer, because the court has relisted 21 additional Second Amendment petitions. Some concern that same felon-in-possession law. Others challenge an AR-15 ban in Cook County, Ill., and high-capacity magazine bans in California and Washington state.

Rodney Reed: Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed is back at the Supreme Court in his fight for DNA testing to provide he’s innocent in a 1996 murder. Three years ago, the court ruled 6-3 in his favor that he hadn’t waited too long to seek the testing. Now, the fight concerns whether the murder weapon Reed wants tested was potentially contaminated, and whether the refusal to test it violates his due process rights. The case is Reed v. Goertz.

Fourth Amendment (pinging Luigi Mangione followers): A criminal defendant in Iowa is asking the justices to provide a national answer on whether police violate the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches when they search someone’s bag without a warrant while arresting them, if the bag was inaccessible to the person when searched. This is the issue at the center of Luigi Mangione’s ongoing pre-trial hearing in New York. The case is Scullark v. Iowa.

Vermont statehouse removal: Vermont State Police Sergeant Jacob Zorn is asking the justices to toss an excessive force lawsuit brought by Shela Linton, who suffered permanent wrist damage after being forcibly from the state House chamber floor in 2015. Linton was conducting a sit-in supporting universal health care. An appeals court ruled a judge wrongly ruled the sergeant could claim qualified immunity without going to trial. The case is Zorn v. Linton.

ON THE DOCKET

Don’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:

Today:

The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments regarding how multiple IQ scores factor into whether someone is eligible for the death penalty. The case is Hamm v. Smith.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal in a challenge to the president’s executive order cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) brought by 11 intelligence community members on DEI-related assignments.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing in two unions’ challenge to Trump’s Labor Day executive order exempting six agencies from the coverage of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.

Thursday:

A federal judge in New York is set to hold a status conference in the sex trafficking case against former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries and two others.

Friday:

There are no notable hearings.

Monday:

The Supreme Court will announce orders.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of a challenge to Trump’s efforts to gut collective bargaining for federal workers, brought by federal employee organizations and unions.

A federal judge in Massachusetts is set to consider university associations’ bid for remedies against the Trump administration after the judge found Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists was unlawful.

A trial is set to begin in Alaska against a man accused of sending graphic threats to kill Supreme Court justices and their family members.

A federal judge in California is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing over the state’s congressional map, adopted through a ballot proposition, Proposition 50, drawn to benefit Democrats.

Tuesday:

A federal judge in Florida is set to oversee a settlement conference in a lawsuit brought by a group of migrants detained at Alligator Alcatraz and four immigration groups seeking to guarantee attorney access and other steps.

A federal judge in Massachusetts is set to oversee a hearing regarding the Trump administration’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to mandate women’s registration for the Selective Service draft.

Another Massachusetts federal judge is set to hold a hearing with countering arguments for summary judgment and dismissal in a challenge to the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians and Venezuelans.

And a third federal judge in Massachusetts is set to oversee a summary judgment hearing in a challenge to DHS’s policy seeking to deport noncitizens to a third country without giving them notice or opportunity to contest their fear of persecution there.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Following a strike on an alleged drug vessel in October, Pentagon lawyers suggested that the two survivors could be placed into a notorious prison in El Salvador, according to three officials. Later that month, Pentagon officials decided that boat strike survivors would be sent back to their home countries or to a third country, three other officials said. During a meeting with the State Department, officials made it clear that they did not want survivors to end up in the U.S. judicial system, where court cases could force the administration to show evidence justifying the strikes. Damien Cave, Edward Wong, and Maria Abi-Habib report for the New York Times.

The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mike Rogers (R-AL), said yesterday that he does not need to further investigate the Sept. 2 strike that killed two survivors. “It’s done,” Rogers told reporters. “I’ve got all the answers I needed.” A spokesperson for Rogers confirmed the congressman’s plans, though his timeline for winding things down was not clear. Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO; Noah Robertson, Dan Lamothe, and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to commit to releasing the video of the Sept. 2 strikes in the Caribbean,” Democratic lawmakers said yesterday after a classified briefing to the “Gang of Eight.” The closed-door discussion, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratclifee, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine mostly centered on the 22 known boat strikes, according to a U.S. official. “I asked them what their strategy is, and what they were doing, and again, did not get satisfying answers at all,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) said after the briefing. Megan Mineiro and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times; Patricia Zengerle, Bipasha Dey, and Ghaneshwar Rajan report for Reuters.

Adm. Alvin Holsey, the outgoing head of U.S. Southern Command, briefed top lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees yesterday. “We got some clarity on the chain of command and who made decisions at what point, but on the legality of it we didn’t get a lot of clarity,” said Representative Adam Smith (D-WA). Megan Mineiro and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times.

The U.S. military yesterday flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appears to be the closest U.S. warplanes have come to Venezuelan airspace since the strikes began in September, according to a public flight tracking website. A U.S. defense official said the jets conducted a “routine training flight” in the area. Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

“I will say frankly that I am ready for elections,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters yesterday, adding that elections could be held in the next 60 to 90 days if the United States and Europe provided Kyiv with security guarantees. Zelenskyy also said yesterday that Ukraine was still working on revising a peace plan, which would probably be sent to the United States on Wednesday. Claire Moss reports for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

A UNICEF spokesperson yesterday called for the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza to be opened to help increase the flow of humanitarian trucks which would bring down the number of children and adults with malnutrition, adding that not enough aid is currently entering Gaza. The spokesperson said that 8,300 pregnant and breastfeeding women in October alone were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition, adding “this pattern is a grave warning and it will likely result in low birthweight babies being born in the Gaza Strip for months to come…This is not over.” UN News reports.

Husam Badran, a member of Hamas’ political wing, yesterday called for the “full implementation of all the terms of the first phase” of the peace plan before moving forward, including an end to the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes in the areas under Israeli-control. Megan Janetsky and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

The anti-Hamas group, Popular Forces, operating from Israeli-held areas of Gaza will continue to fight Hamas despite the killing of a prominent commander, Yasser Abu Shabab, last week, according to Ghassan Duhine, a deputy in the group. Three Egyptian sources said that such anti-Hamas groups had increased their activities since the ceasefire, and estimated they now had 1,000 fighters, adding 400 since the truce. A diplomat said the groups lacked any popular constituency, but added that their emergence raised concerns for stability in Gaza. Aidan Lewis reports for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The United States yesterday imposed sanctions on four individuals and four firms for their alleged involvement in a transnational network that recruits former Colombian military members who train soldiers for the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary. Under-Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said the RSF was supported by Colombian fighters when it captured El Fasher in October. Fatima Hussein reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has continued for a third day, showing no signs of slowing, as hundreds of thousands of people are displaced. About 400,000 people have been evacuated from across seven provinces in Thailand and around 700 schools closed, according to a spokesperson for the Thai military. The Cambodian defense ministry said that Cambodia has evacuated more than 127,000 villagers and closed hundreds of schools. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media that the two nations should “cease hostilities immediately,” adding that they must follow de-escalatory measures outlined in the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords in October. Jerry Harmer and Jintamas Saksornchai report for AP News; Kelly Ng reports for BBC News.

Russian and Chinese bombers yesterday conducted a joint, eight-hour patrol near Japan and South Korea, the Japanese defense ministry said. “The repeated joint flights of bombers by both countries signify an expansion and intensification of activities around our country, while clearly intending to demonstrate force against our nation, posing a serious concern for our national security,” Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said on social media. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said that the patrol was a normal part of regular cooperation between the Russian and Chinese militaries. Jason Douglas reports for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday suggested that Lindsey Halligan should resign as U.S. attorney after a ruling declared her appointment unlawful, pointing toward Alina Habba’s resignation on Monday. The judge also asked whether there was any legal guidance issued by the Justice Department to explain why Halligan is still in the job. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has advised internally that Halligan could stay because the judge’s decision declaring her appointment invalid did not require a specific measure to be taken, according to sources. Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) removed language from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have restored a State Department office tasked with relocating Afghan refugees, a senior Senate Democrat and another source said yesterday.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought signalled over the weekend that the White House may again use a reconciliation bill to increase defense spending next year. This approach has sparked criticism from Democrats and Republican lawmakers, who warn it sets a dangerous precedent and erodes one of the last areas of bipartisan consensus on the Hill. “I would prefer to use the regular appropriations process,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-MS) said. The strategy of combining a reconciliation package with the base defense budget could potentially push defense spending above $1 trillion.

Those who interfered or helped fugitive slaves escape were fined $500. When enslaved people escaped, plantation owners relied on state and local government officials for enforcement.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 took it a step further. While it also allowed runaway slaves to be grabbed off the street, it made the federal government responsible for enforcing the law, and imposed harsh penalties ($1,000 fines and up to six-months imprisonment) on federal marshals who refused to help.

I am in no way equating the brutal institution of slavery with violations of immigration laws.

According to the laws of the United States, it was illegal for the enslaved to escape slavery and it is illegal now to enter this country without complying with the immigration laws.

But on our streets, you’re seeing law enforcement use tactics that were also prominently used in 1793 and 1850.

We pride ourselves to the world that we are a country based on the Rule of Law. The Rule of Law safeguards fundamental human rights, protects against the arbitrary exercise of power, and applies laws equally and fairly to everyone, regardless of who they are.

Ministers from 27 EU member nations are meeting in Brussels to discuss countering migrant smuggling, with a keynote speech by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In Strasbourg, France, representatives from the Council of Europe — 46 countries from Iceland to Azerbaijan — are expected to debate making deporting migrants easier for signatories to key treaties.

Denmark was part of a nine-nation attempt last year to curtail the power of the European Court of Human Rights, the independent legal arm of the Council of Europe. Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland argued that the court's interpretation of rights obligations prevented them from expelling migrants who commit crimes. That effort ultimately failed, but support for its basic tenets has since grown.

The European Court of Human Rights handles complaints against the Council of Europe, under the European Convention on Human Rights, including many cases involving migrants and asylum-seekers. The intergovernmental organization is not an EU institution and was set up in the wake of the World War II to promote peace and democracy.

Centrist and left-wing parties across Europe are coalescing around the idea of tougher migration policies as a way to blunt the momentum of far-right politicians exploiting discontent over immigration.

The prime ministers of Denmark and the U.K. published an op-ed in the Guardian newspaper on Tuesday calling for tightening migration controls to deny entry to those seeking better economic opportunities as opposed to fleeing conflict.

“For decades, citizens in our countries have demanded action. So we are acting — not to exploit these issues and stoke grievances as some do, but to find real solutions,” wrote Mette Frederiksen and Keir Starmer. “The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem.”

Illegal border crossings into the EU were down 22% from January to October this year, according to Frontex, the EU’s border and coast guard agency. The agency recorded 152,000 unauthorized border crossings in the first 10 months of the year.

Most migration to Europe happens legally, by air, with some immigrants overstaying tourist visas.

The EU has spent billions of euros (dollars) to deter irregular migration, paying countries in Africa and the Middle East to intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean of the Atlantic. At the same time, European nations facing labor shortages and an aging population are in desperate need of more workers and have been investing in programs to attract and train foreign workers.

The secretary-general of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, said ahead of the Strasbourg meeting that the European Convention on Human Rights was “the final safeguard of individual rights and freedoms across our continent.”

“The convention’s future and Europe’s direction are inseparable,” he said.

Ministers called on the council’s Committee of Ministers to prepare a draft political declaration reaffirming the obligation to ensure the effective enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the ECHR to everyone within the jurisdiction of member states, “in the context of these challenges”.

They also specified that the text should also take into account “governments’ fundamental responsibility to ensure national vital interests such as security and public safety”.

The declaration is expected to be adopted at the next formal session of the Committee of Ministers in the Moldovan capital Chisinau in May 2026.

The ministers also backed the development of a new recommendation on deterring and fighting the smuggling of migrants, with full respect for their human rights.

Crayk added that immigration court records list Celis’ criminal history as “none” and said ICE officers handled the case appropriately, while DHS leadership did not.","The Department of Homeland Security ignited a firestorm in a local immigration case after posting a statement on X accusing Jair Celis, a 29-year-old Utah husband and father, of having a criminal history involving “sodomy of a child and sexual abuse of a child.”

DHS called him a “predator” and said the government would not grant green cards to “child abusers.”

When KUTV contacted local ICE public information officers, they could not confirm the allegations. A search of Utah’s state court system also found no such criminal history — only a citation for texting and driving in 2024.

Celis’s attorney, Adam Crayk, said the DHS post is false and defamatory and plans to sue the department for libel. He said the accusations stem from a sealed juvenile case involving Celis when he was around 16 years old.

According to Crayk, the situation involved two teenagers in a relationship and did not include the offenses DHS publicly claimed.

“They were boyfriend and girlfriend, there was literally nothing related to sodomy in anything that happened at the juvenile adjudication,” he said. “We had two kids, a girl who could not consent, and candidly, a young man who, at the time, could not consent either. A family that was upset about the relationship and a record that was subsequently sealed.”

Utah law requires all juvenile court records to be sealed, so KUTV cannot independently confirm the details, though Crayk maintains the juvenile filings did not include sodomy.

Utah family shocked after ICE arrests husband during final green card interview

Attorney answers questions about man arrested by ICE at immigration review

The DHS post came just a week after Celis was taken into custody during what was supposed to be his final green card interview in West Valley City. Crayk said Celis has no adult criminal record and should have left that appointment with an approved green card.

Celis, who reportedly came to the United States from Mexico at age 10, overstayed a visa that expired six months later in 2008. His wife, Lexie Celis, a U.S. citizen, said the arrest has torn their family apart.

“For all the people who think that they’re just getting criminals, I am an example of them tearing our family apart,” she said. “I just feel betrayed. I feel no U.S. citizen should have to go through this.”

The couple has been married for four years and has a young child, a U.S. citizen. DHS documents show Celis’ father is a U.S. citizen, and his mother is a Mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident with a green card.

ICE issued its own statement on Tuesday saying Celis “is an illegal alien from Mexico” who overstayed a 2007 visa and was arrested for that violation.

Department of Homeland Security documents state Celis will remain in custody pending removal proceedings and is expected to appear before an immigration judge on Jan. 14, 2026, at 8 a.m. in Las Vegas.

Celis’ attorneys also provided KUTV with the DHS Notice to Appear documents filed this week. They show Celis was taken into custody on Dec. 2 at noon in Salt Lake City. The documents state:

He entered the U.S. in July 2007 as a B-2 tourist and remained beyond the January 2008 expiration date.

He applied for a marriage-based green card in November 2024.

Criminal-history checks were negative.

NCIC records showed no wants or warrants.

The “basis for ICE charges” section was left blank.

Crayk said those federal records directly contradict DHS’s public claims of criminal history and show the agency misrepresented sealed juvenile allegations to portray Celis as a child predator.

“We were appalled and disheartened to see our own government engage in a smear campaign with information that is sealed and only available to the government through their national security powers,” he said. “Even more disheartening is the fact that the government labeled Jair Celis with a title that was never proven, never established, and did not even enter into any of the record in juvenile court.”

“To be clear, under Utah and U.S. immigration law, juvenile adjudications are not criminal convictions and do not constitute criminal history,” he said.

Crayk added that immigration court records list Celis’ criminal history as “none” and said ICE officers handled the case appropriately, while DHS leadership did not.

“You would think that someone tweeting from a DHS leadership position would verify before publishing inaccurate and salacious garbage to the world,” Crayk said. “All this will do is create a wider divide and more polarizing behavior between those that support the administration and those that do not.”

It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.
In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.
Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees.
Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.","The Trump administration is transforming the agency known for processing green cards and citizenship requests into one of its strongest anti-immigration policing arms.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is one of the three branches of the Homeland Security Department that deals with migration.

Traditionally, its more than 20,000 employees have focused on the various ways people can lawfully immigrate and stay in the U.S. — be that applying for asylum, a green card, citizenship, work visa, or another legal pathway.

Since January, administration officials have taken an axe to that traditional mission by encouraging early retirements, shuttering collective bargaining agreements and drastically cutting back on programs that facilitate legal migration. New job postings lean into the rhetoric of hiring ""homeland defenders"" and tackling fraud.

During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that ""at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.""

The efforts come as President Trump seeks to curb illegal immigration but also reduce legal ways to get to the U.S. and stay here, especially for certain nationalities.

It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.

With the recent changes, at least 1,300 people took the ""Fork in the Road"" resignation offer for federal employees, while others have left on their own. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees were not allowed to take the offer.)

And it's catching immigrants and their families, lawyers and advocates off guard.

""'Am I going to get arrested?' … That's a question, regardless of their past,"" said Eric Welsh, an immigration attorney in California who helps his clients apply for various USCIS programs.

""There really is a lot more fear and there is a lot more concern about, should we do it at all?,"" Welsh said, about people applying for legal status.

Rapid changes after deadly shooting

The changes have been rapid. In recent weeks, the White House said it would re-review all approved refugee claims under the Biden administration.

After an Afghan national was charged for shooting two National Guard members in late November, the administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, and ordered retroactive reviews of already-approved applications.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,"" Trump wrote on social media after the shooting. ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.

""USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,"" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.

""Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.""

Recent policies come after a swath of other changes this year. Policy memos have emphasized that the priority for refugees is admitting those who can easily assimilate into the country, with the target demographic being white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The White House also capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest since the modern refugee program started in the 1980s.

The agency has unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.

Reports of arrests and detention following routine USCIS interviews and appointments have increased fear among immigrants.

""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. ""That's a pretty different stance towards immigration than we've seen over recent decades.""

In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.

""Some people, if they have a green card, might just wait to naturalize and see if they can wait for a new administration,"" Gelatt said.

USCIS leans into enforcement and policing tactics

The new administration has prioritized the agency's law enforcement work.

For example, USCIS has promoted a new role: ""homeland defenders.""

It is unclear exactly what these positions are responsible for. USCIS said they will be ""interviewing aliens, reviewing applications, and identifying criminal or ineligible aliens.""

The posting also specifies this position is expected to provide direct support to CBP and ICE, two agencies leading the effort to arrest, detain and deport immigrants.

The roles also seem to cater to those with backgrounds in traditional law enforcement, contrary to a background in immigration law and administrative government work that is more typical for USCIS.

USCIS said it received some 35,000 applications for the role of ""homeland defender"" and has made ""hundreds"" of job offers, including to former law enforcement officials and veterans, according to a November USCIS press release.

""USCIS is cutting bureaucratic red tape to hire fiercely dedicated, America-first patriots to serve on the frontlines and hold the line against terrorists, criminal aliens, and bad actors intent on infiltrating our nation,"" the release stated.

It also created USCIS special agents, who have law enforcement authority to carry firearms, and investigate, arrest and prosecute immigration cases. In the past, much of this would be the work of ICE or CBP, according to the release announcing the new workforce.

""Certainly the immigration enforcement side of things that are happening has sent a message that anybody who isn't a citizen in the United States could be arrested and put into ICE detention and potentially deported,"" Gelatt said. ""That has a real chilling effect on people's willingness to interact with the government generally, and with USCIS as well.""

USCIS workers defend past enforcement

The changes are having an impact inside the agency, as workers feel out of the loop about the direction and pace of changes.

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees. He says morale is some of the lowest he's seen in his tenure, thanks to the termination of the union contract, a haphazard back-to-office mandate that has employees working in makeshift desks, and a lack of communication from agency leadership.

""There are questions about what will be our mission, what will be our focus? And to that extent, we are alarmed by rhetoric,"" Knowles said. He said the agency has always enforced the nation's immigration laws when it processes applications.

One USCIS refugee officer who recently departed the agency after nearly a decade said the speed of the changes ""overwhelmed"" employees, and recent changes were the last straw. The person spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retaliation from the agency they hope to return to.

USCIS staffers say they have always worked hard to ensure people don't get benefits they do not qualify for, and also look for people who may be breaking the law.

So employees were upset by the administration's implication that they hadn't been doing their jobs properly for the last five years, after the White House announced all refugees admitted under in the Biden era must be reinterviewed.

""It's going to cause a lot of confusion. It's going to cause a lot of chaos. It's going to cost a lot of money,"" the employee said. ""It seems impossible.""

USCIS said it has paused the approvals while it ""works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.

Not ""an adversarial office""

Beyond policy and rhetoric changes, there's been subtler signs of transformation.

Signs inside USCIS offices urge people to leave the country, mirroring the tone of a detention center, rather than that of an immigration office, according to Welsh and other lawyers.

""USCIS is not designed to be an adversarial office,"" he said. ""They're not the enforcers. They're not looking to reduce.""

Now, he said, his clients are concerned with needing to have proof of a good moral character by providing church attendance or charitable donation history, for example.

""It's now certainly not the kind of friendly atmosphere that we used to experience with the agency,"" Welsh said.

Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.

""We have borders and we have benefits. So for people who deserve them or people who have earned them for various reasons, we provide them,"" Welsh said. ""If we just go into a pure enforcement mindset, then there's no happy place to be.""

The president told the crowd gathered at a casino and resort in Mount Pocono that inflation was no longer a problem and that Democrats had used the term ""affordability"" as a ""hoax"" to hurt his reputation. But his remarks weaved wildly to include grievances he first raised behind closed doors in his first term in 2018 — and later denied saying — asking why the U.S. doesn't have more immigrants from Scandinavia.

""Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?"" Trump said onstage. ""Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few?""

Trump said he objected to taking immigrants from ""hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries."" He added for emphasis that those places ""are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.""

Tuesday's gathering in the swing state — and in a competitive House district — was an official White House event, yet it seemed more like one of his signature campaign rallies that his chief of staff said he would hold regularly ahead of next year's midterms. But instead of being in an arena that could draw several thousand attendees, it was held in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, a small town of about 3,000 residents.

Voters starting to blame lasting inflation on Republicans

Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

He displayed a chart comparing price increases under his predecessor, Joe Biden, to prices under his own watch to argue his case. But the overall inflation rate has climbed since he announced broad tariffs in April and left many Americans worried about their grocery, utility and housing bills.

""I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,"" Trump said. ""They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.""

As the president spoke, his party's political vulnerabilities were further seen as Miami voters chose Eileen Higgins to be their first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. Higgins defeated the Trump-endorsed Republican Emilio Gonzalez.

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally showed he could still appeal to the base, but it was unable to settle questions of whether he could hold together his 2024 coalition. Monroe County flipped to Trump last year after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.

As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.

In Monroe County, people agree that prices are a problem

But what seems undeniable — even to Trump supporters in Monroe County — is that inflation seems to be here to stay.

Lou Heddy, a retired maintenance mechanic who voted for Trump last year, said he's noticed in the past month alone that his and his wife's grocery bills have risen from $175 to $200, and he's not sure Trump can bring food prices down.

""Once the prices get up for food, they don't ever come back down. That's just the way I feel. I don't know how the hell he would do it,"" said Heddy, 72.

But Suzanne Vena, a Democratic voter, blames Trump's tariffs for making life more expensive, as she struggles with rising bills for food, rent and electricity on a fixed income. She remembers Trump saying that he would stop inflation.

""That's what we were originally told,"" said Vena, 66. ""Did I believe it? That's another question. I did not.""

The area Trump visited could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.

Trump held his rally in a congressional district held by first-term Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.

Speaking to the crowd before Trump, Bresnahan said the administration was working to lower costs, but voters ""aren't asking for partisan arguments — they're asking for results.""

It's not clear if Trump can motivate voters in Monroe County to show up in next year's election if they're worried about inflation.

Nick Riley, 38, said he's cutting back on luxuries, like going out to eat, as he absorbs higher bills for food and electricity and is having a hard time finding a good deal on a used car. Riley voted for Trump in 2020, but he sat out the 2024 election and plans to do so again next year.

""We're all broke. It doesn't matter whether you support Republicans or support Democrats,"" Riley said. ""We're all broke, and we're all feeling it.""

Trump to start holding more rallies before midterm elections

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show ""The Mom View"" that Trump would be on the campaign trail next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.

Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.

""We're actually going to turn that on its head,"" Wiles said, ""and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.""

The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying a historic boom.

Asked on a Politico podcast how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into grade inflation by answering ""A-plus,"" only to then amend his answer to ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

Trump says economy is strong, but Americans should buy fewer dolls

The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

So far, the public has been skeptical about Trump's economic performance. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

But Trump indicated that his tariffs and other policies were helping industries such as the steel sector. He said those industries mattered for the country as he then specifically told Americans that they should buy fewer pencils and dolls from overseas.

""You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,"" he told the crowd. ""Two or three is nice.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6340x3566+0+330/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fed%2F0dd5b6fa4d92ad9d0aed00e75ef3%2Fap25344087106176.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 05:57:15.593621

Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.
“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote.","The Republican-controlled House and Senate have not done much to stand in the way of President Donald Trump — even when his actions have encroached on terrain the Constitution reserved for them.

But there are signs that some Republican lawmakers are trying to reassert their independence.

When news broke last week that the Pentagon carried out a second strike on two individuals on a largely-destroyed alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, even some Republicans expressed alarm.

""Somebody made a horrible decision,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. told reporters in the Capitol. ""Somebody needs to be held accountable. This is our job. This is part of oversight. That's pretty straightforward.""

The strikes are not the only actions that have spurred a handful of Republicans to stake out a bit of daylight with the Trump Administration. Some have criticized Trump's tariffs, like Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.

""Our lobsterman, our blueberry growers, our potato farmers will pay the price,"" Collins said in October, before a vote to roll back tariffs on Canada.

Ahead of the upcoming expiration date for enhanced health care subsidies, which Trump has signaled indifference to renewing, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned last month of a ""massive crisis unless Congress acts.""

Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon has been one of the most consistent critics of Trump's approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion into Ukraine. Bacon consistently calls it a soft touch, particularly in contrast to Trump's approach to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The velvet glove, red carpet treatment for Putin and then the condescending, boorish behavior that the president and the vice president has done towards Zelenskyy – it's a contrast,"" Bacon told Nebraska Public Media earlier this year.

Senators have also pushed back on Trump's intermittent calls to end the filibuster. ""You'd have to be smoking wizard weed to vote for that,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters during the 43 day government shutdown that ended last month.

And Trump's reluctance to release the investigative files into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein spurred a break between the president and one of his closest allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

""He called me a traitor for standing with these women,"" she said.

Moments of GOP resistance or a growing trend?

After months of the White House steamrolling Congress on tariffs, appropriations and military intervention, even this careful pushback is a departure, says former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Az.).

Flake says the shift is accelerating with Trump's declining approval rating. The pushback also grew following Republicans' poor performance in off-year elections last month.

""There was a lot of fear about what he could do to you electorally,"" Flake said. ""That's diminishing.""

Flake, who did not run for reelection in 2018 in part because he refused to unconditionally back Trump, says some lawmakers are now more willing to say aloud what they long expressed behind closed doors.

""Obviously behind the scenes, it's a whole different ballgame,"" he said. ""This migration is happening and when Republicans get there, they'll get to a new-old place where they were on some of these threshold issues that have animated conservatives for decades.""

But this is not the first time observers have declared a new era, only for Trump to firm up his grip on Congressional Republicans, including the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.

""A lot of us have been wrong on how long this has endured,"" he said.

Most of the Republicans vocalizing their disagreements are retiring, represent competitive districts or are perennial centrists. And some of the splits with Trump have not been over traditional Republican values, but urging him to follow through on the populist platform he ran on.

Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Congress has made some recent attempts to push back on the White House, like resolutions rebuking the tariffs and boat strikes, but they have not been very successful or sufficient.

""I'd like to see more, and I believe that if we don't stand up for our powers under the Constitution, nobody else will,"" Murkowski told NPR in an interview.

Constitutional role of Congress

The framers gave the Congress the power to appropriate funds, to declare war and levy taxes, like tariffs.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says it is unfair to say this Congress has relinquished its authority as an independent, coequal branch.

""I don't know how much different this one is,"" Thune told NPR. ""A lot of times if I have differences with the administration, I don't litigate it in public. But we do have a responsibility as partners to try to get an agenda done for the American people that they voted for.""

Molly Reynolds, a Brookings Institution expert on Congress, says it's true this is not just a Trump-era phenomenon. Congress has been ceding power to the executive and judicial branches for decades.

""And in some cases, Congress has been a willing and eager participant in sacrificing its own power to the other branches,"" she said.

Reynolds said this did not start with Trump's willingness to act more unilaterally in his second term, but it did escalate the trend. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) recently told The Katie Miller Podcast that, ""We have this joke that I'm not really a Speaker of the House.""

Reynolds, who jokingly calls herself a partisan of the first branch, says it is no accident the legislative branch is established in Article 1 of the Constitution. She said the framers saw the legislative branch as the closest to the people. The separation of powers and checks and balances are foundational concepts of the American form of government.

Reynolds said there is precedent for Congress taking steps to reassert its power, like the Watergate-era reforms to reign in the power of the president.

""It was in a really different political moment than the one we're living in now,"" Reynolds said, noting that politics is more polarized today. ""Which is part of what makes it challenging to see the prospects for a similar burst of institutional patriotism.""

Raul Malo, the leader of the country band The Mavericks and one of the most recognizable voices in roots music, died Monday night, according to a representative of the band. The guitarist and singer had been battling cancer.

He was hospitalized last week, forcing him to miss tribute shows staged in his honor at the Ryman Auditorium over the weekend. He was 60 years old.

""No one embodied life and love, joy and passion, family, friends, music and adventure the way our beloved Raul did,"" read a statement released by his family.

Malo's group, The Mavericks, mourned the loss of their leader in a social post.

""Anyone with the pleasure of being in Raul's orbit knew that he was a force of human nature, with an infectious energy,"" the statement read. ""Over a career of more than three decades entertaining millions around the globe, his towering creative contributions and unrivaled, generational talent created the kind of multicultural American music reaching far beyond America itself.""

Over a career that lasted four decades, The Mavericks lived up to the band's name, challenging expectations and following a roadmap crafted by Malo's expansive musical upbringing as the son of Cuban immigrants in Miami.

""I grew up in a very musical household. There was all kinds of music around always,"" he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1995. ""We listened to everything from Hank Williams to Celia Cruz to Sam Cooke to Bobby Darin. It didn't matter.""

In 1992, Malo told NPR that his widespread influences weren't always understood or appreciated in his South Florida hometown, but he said that his struggle to fit in taught him to trust his instincts. Malo had become the guitarist and lead singer for The Mavericks in 1989, alongside co-founders Robert Reynolds and Paul Deakin, and his roaring, sentimental voice defined the band's sound and remained its constant as the group's catalog moved from slow, tender ballads to full-throttle rock songs. In 1995, the band released its biggest hit with ""All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,"" a swinging country song featuring an assist from Tex-Mex accordion legend Flaco Jimenez.

As the band grew in members and devoted listeners, The Mavericks continued to push the boundaries of American music, weaving a richly layered tapestry of textures and stories. With more than a dozen studio albums, The Mavericks collected praise and recognition from the Academy of Country Music, the Country Music Association and the Recording Academy. Although they took a hiatus for several years, Malo never stopped making music — and returned to his bandmates with renewed inspiration.

Following its 30th anniversary, the group released its first full-length Spanish album in 2020, aptly titled En Español. The record reimagined Latin standards and folklore-tinged popular tunes; it also made an implicit political statement about Latin music's contributions to American culture.

""In our own little way, if we could get somebody that perhaps is on the fence on issues and hears us singing in Spanish and perhaps reminds them of the beautiful cultures that make up what this country is trying to be and what it should be, so be it,"" Malo told NPR at the time. ""Yeah, I'm OK with that.""

The following year, the Americana Music Association recognized The Mavericks with the Trailblazer Award. In 2024, the band released its last studio album, Moon & Stars. The release coincided with news of Malo's cancer diagnosis, which he discussed openly with NPR's Ayesha Rascoe.

Before being hospitalized last week, Malo had been scheduled to perform with The Mavericks at a pair of tribute concerts held this past weekend at the legendary Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Over 30 artists, including Patty Griffin, Jim Lauderdale and Steve Earle, still gathered to pay tribute to Malo, with some of the proceeds of the night going to the cancer prevention organization Stand Up To Cancer.

According to his spokesperson, though Malo was too ill to attend, the concert was streamed to his hospital room Friday night.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has mostly blocked efforts to investigate misconduct within its ranks, according to the county inspector general, who announced his retirement Tuesday after 12 years on the job.

In an open letter, Max Huntsman cited examples of how the county has thwarted his efforts to watchdog the department, which in the past has been plagued with accusations that deputies use excessive force and lie on the job.

Huntsman said one example is former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s misuse of criminal enforcement powers to discredit critics, such as opening an investigation into former County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl.

Villanueva was sheriff from 2018 to 2022.

“My requests for investigation were rejected,” Huntsman’s letter reads. “Even after receiving an official subpoena, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to turn over records regarding the improper surveillance.”

He added: “Sometimes members of the public wonder if frightening new surveillance techniques will be used for improper purposes under the guise of criminal investigation. Sadly, the answer is yes.”

Before becoming inspector general in 2013, Huntsman, 60, was a deputy district attorney who specialized in public corruption. He told LAist on Tuesday that the inspector general job wasn’t something he wanted initially.

“I didn’t want to go work for politicians,” he said. “But the need to provide some kind of independent reporting and analysis was significant.”

The Sheriff’s Department issued a statement saying it valued the Office of the Inspector General and all county oversight bodies and that it wished Huntsman and his family well in his retirement.

The department said it “continues to make great strides in advancing the department in a transparent manner.”

LAist also reached out to the county CEO and county counsel for comment, but they declined.

After George Floyd

In the letter, Huntsman says the state of California has come a long way in strengthening the power of local law enforcement oversight bodies, in part because of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

After widespread protests — and lobbying by Huntsman — the state provided authority to inspectors general to enforce subpoenas requiring law enforcement agencies to hand over documents and authorized external investigation of police misconduct, including deputy gang conduct.

The Sheriff’s Department — backed by county lawyers — has resisted.

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote. “The county refuses to require the photographing of suspected gang tattoos in secretive groups that the undersheriff has identified as violating state law.”

“Just a few weeks ago, we requested some information regarding an investigation, and a pair of commanders refused to give it to us,” Huntsman said in an interview with LAist.

Origin of the office

The Inspector General’s Office was created by the county Board of Supervisors in 2013 in response to a scandal that included former Sheriff Lee Baca covering up the abuses of jail inmates.

Baca went to federal prison.

Since then, the office has issued dozens of reports with recommendations for improving living conditions inside jails that some have described as “filthy,” stopping abuses of juveniles inside juvenile halls and providing shower privacy for inmates as part of the requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.

“All of these abuses were reported by the Office of Inspector General and recommendations were ignored,” Huntsman wrote. Often, it took court orders to enact change.

“When we first blew the whistle on the torturous chaining of mentally ill prisoners to benches for 36 hours at a time, it was only a court order that ended the practice,” he wrote. “Time and time again, this pattern repeated itself.”

Huntsman wrote the county has permitted the Sheriff’s Department to block oversight and defunded the Office of Inspector General by removing a third of its staff.

“It's not surprising the county has driven out two successive chairs of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission,” he wrote.

“Government always claims to value transparency and accountability, but shooting the messenger is still the most common response to criticism,” Huntsman wrote.

Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work

Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.

“I’ve really enjoyed the work and I’m sad to have it end,” he said.

It’s a sentiment he echoed in his letter, adding that despite the setbacks and roadblocks, he was proud of the people with whom he shared the office.

“It has been my honor to work with a talented, brave and tireless group of public servants to ensure that the public knows what its government is doing,” he wrote.

He noted the inspector general’s reports are fact-checked by the office and public.

“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote. “What you do about it is up to you.,”

In May 2025 the Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal to enable the Court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family.
Prior to clarifying the test for family life, the Court of Appeal conducted a thorough review of both the ECHR authorities and the domestic authorities.
The Government’s policy document states that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’.
purporting to narrow ‘family life’ to ‘parents and their children’.","On 27 November 2025 the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in IA v SHHD [2025] EWCA Civ 1516 clarifying the correct test to be used when determining whether there is ‘family life’ in immigration cases. The Court of Appeal followed the consistent line of case law from the European Court of Human Rights in stating that in cases not concerning the core family, family life will only be established where there are additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties. This is well-established doctrine. The judgment is, however, significant as the earlier tribunal decisions in IA have played a critical role in influencing policy making in respect of immigration and human rights law. First, the tribunal decisions in IA were cited as indicative of the problems with Article 8 ECHR in legal advice that was published by the Conservative Party in relation to withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (the Wolfson Report). Second, it appears that the tribunal decisions in IA have shaped the Government’s proposal to legislate on the definition to be applied to family life (Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government’s asylum and returns policy). Given these developments it is essential that we examine what the Court of Appeal has determined and what this might mean for reform proposals.

The Background and Facts in IA

IA concerned a family from Gaza that was seeking reunification with a family member in the UK. The family consisted of a father, mother and their four children (who were aged 18, 17, 8 and 7). They applied to enter to join the younger brother of the father (their sponsor) who had been living and working in the UK since 2007 and is now a British citizen. They were not eligible to apply for entry under the Immigration Rules and thus they sought leave for entry outside the rules. Their application was rejected by the Home Office.

In considering whether the decision to reject the application was compatible with Article 8 ECHR, the First Tier Tribunal (FTT) held that although there was family life, such that Article 8 ECHR was applicable, the right could not outweigh the weight to be attached to the public interest. The FTT’s decision was later overturned by the Upper Tribunal (UT) on the basis that there were flaws in the way in which the FTT had assessed the significance to be accorded to family life when carrying out the balancing exercise. The UT thus remade the decision and allowed the applicants’ appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

It was the UT’s decision which then became the basis of a dispute in Parliament between Kemi Badenoch and the Prime Minister, during which the Prime Minister stated:

Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The Leader of the Opposition is right that it is the wrong decision. She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last Government, according to their legal framework. However, let me be clear: it should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the Government who make the policy. That is the principle. The Home Secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.

This led to a rebuke from the Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, who commented that she was ‘deeply troubled’ by the exchange between Kemi Badenoch and Keir Starmer as ‘both the question and the answer were unacceptable’. She went on to state that:

It is for government to visibly respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. Where parties, including the government, disagree with the judgment they should do so through the appellate process. Of course, MPs, just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law. I have taken this up as you would imagine and expect. I have written to the prime minister and lord chancellor.

In May 2025 the Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal to enable the Court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family.

While the appeal was pending, IA was cited in the Conservative Party’s Wolfson Report as part of the rationale for withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights. The Wolfson report stated (at [45]) that:

courts have given an extremely broad interpretation to the scope of the concept of “family life” to include relationships between siblings (including adult siblings); aunts or uncles and nephews or nieces; and grandparents and grandchildren.

It then cited IA in relation to its determination (at [45]) that:

The problematic effect of this in practice is that it provides first-tier judges with a broad margin within which “family life” can be found to exist, and a similarly broad margin of discretion for finding whether there has been an interference with such right and whether that interference can be justified (particularly given that the treatment of family members outside the UK can be taken into consideration when establishing whether there has been interference with the right to family life).

Following which it appears that IA, and the discourse surrounding it, fed into the Government’s proposal in November 2025 to set out in primary legislation the meaning of ‘family life’ for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. This is the political backdrop to the Court of Appeal judgment.

The Court of Appeal’s Judgment

Before the Court of Appeal, the SSHD argued, amongst other things, that there was no family life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR and that, even if the Convention right applied, the UT had erred in conducting the proportionality analysis. The SSHD succeeded on both those grounds. The Court of Appeal held that the proper test had not been applied by the tribunals and that applying the correct test there was no family life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. Though this would have been sufficient to allow the appeal, the Court of Appeal also agreed that even if there had been family life that the UT had made several errors in undertaking the balancing exercise. Essentially, too much weight had been given to the family’s interests, while insufficient weight had been accorded to the Government’s immigration policies. The Court of Appeal thus concluded that the UT should not have determined that the balance was struck in favour of entry.

Given the Government is proposing to introduce legislation on the definition of family life it is necessary to examine what the Court of Appeal said about the test for family life and how this aligns with the policy proposals.

Prior to clarifying the test for family life, the Court of Appeal conducted a thorough review of both the ECHR authorities and the domestic authorities. It concluded (at [60]) that:

the consistent jurisprudence of the ECtHR from S v UK [a 1984 Commission case] onwards has been that family life, within the autonomous meaning of article 8(1), is only to be found between adult siblings where “additional elements of dependence involving more than the normal emotional ties” are demonstrated.

The Court of Appeal was thus clear that the ECHR case law is not ambiguous on this point. In respect of the domestic case law, the Court of Appeal noted that while there may have been some twists and turns ‘the domestic courts have been consistently attempting to follow that ECtHR jurisprudence’ (at [61]). Consequently, ‘[e]ven if some of the domestic decisions may have provided divergent interpretations of the additional elements of the dependency test, none has suggested that they wanted to depart from the ECtHR jurisprudence’ (at [117]). The Court of Appeal therefore held that the correct test is that set out by the ECtHR in Kumari and the House of Lords in Beoku-Betts (at [116]), namely that in cases not concerning the core family, family life will only be established where there are ‘additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties’ ([at 119]). The Court of Appeal also confirmed that this is a fact-sensitive exercise (at [119]), that ‘financial dependency and dependency created by physical or mental disability both play a part in the evaluation’ but that it is not necessary to demonstrate ‘exclusive or complete dependency’ (at [120]). Applying this to the facts, the Court found that although there were close emotional ties that additional elements of dependency had not been demonstrated in this case.

How then does the dependency test identified and used by the Court of Appeal in IA compare with the Government plans for reform? The Government’s policy document states that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. As I observed in an earlier blog post some confusion arises from the fact that when the Home Secretary announced the policy in Parliament she stated that the Government will define ‘what, exactly, a family is – narrowing it down to parents and their children’, an approach which is narrower than that stated in the policy document. We can therefore identify three ways in which the Government might seek to legislate in respect of the definition of family life: (i) an additional elements of dependence test (i.e. following the wording of the case law) ; (ii) an exceptionally close link test (i.e. following the wording of the policy document) and (iii) a parents and children only test (i.e. following the statement of the Home Secretary).

(i) Additional Elements of Dependence Model

The first option is that the ‘additional elements of dependence’ test, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in IA, will be placed on a legislative footing. If future legislation simply replicates this test, then this would be no substantive change at all. It is, however, possible that any legislation might also purport to specify the criteria that the courts should apply in determining whether that dependency threshold is met. Those criteria might reflect those that have been identified in case law i.e. factors such as physical or mental dependency or financial dependency (as acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in IA). However, as the Court of Appeal observed in IA the dependency test is a fact-sensitive exercise, and the examples are non-exhaustive. Consequently, to remain compatible with Article 8 ECHR any legislation would need to both encompass what is in the existing case law while also not limiting the interpretation of dependency to those circumstances. In this regard it is worth observing that the Court of Appeal opined that ‘[i]n our judgment it is undesirable to lay down hard and fast rules as to how the additional elements of dependency test should be applied’ (at [125]).

(ii) Exceptionally Close Link Model

A second possibility is that legislation may replicate the language from the Government’s policy document i.e. introducing the concept of an ‘exceptionally close link’. As I have indicated previously, this could encompass a broader category of persons than those who currently fall within the dependency test and certainly introducing a new concept is likely to result in further ambiguity. This is evident if we consider the approaches to family life that were examined in IA. In IA the applicants argued that the ‘additional elements of dependency’ test is the ‘other side of the coin’ of a ‘real, committed or effective support’ test. The reference to ‘real, committed or effective support’ derives from dictum of Sedley LJ in Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 at [17], which had been used by the FTT in IA as a means of determining whether there was family life. The applicants thus argued that where there is ‘real, committed or effective support’, which the FTT had found that there was on these facts, that the dependency test is satisfied and Article 8 ECHR is applicable. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal on the basis that it is possible for there to be ‘real support’ without there being any ‘serious dependency’ (at [122]). Consequently, it observed that while:

it would be going too far to say that it is wrong to test whether there are additional elements of dependency by reference to real, committed or effective support provided’ the fact of ‘real, committed and effective support is not the test itself, because the level of real support, for example, may be minor or insignificant, whereas the word “dependency” denotes a significant relationship. This is not a semantic point. (at [123] emphasis in original)

Indeed, the fact that this was not a semantic point was borne out by IA itself as the Court of Appeal found that the FTT had applied the ‘real committed and effective support test’ and that this was a ‘less exacting standard’ (at [128]). It went on to observe:

The FTT had said expressly that the support test was a lower one than the dependence test and that there was no need to establish dependency. As we have explained, dependency is different from support. Establishing real, committed or effective support by itself may or may not be sufficient to establish additional elements of dependency for the existence of family life between adult siblings. (at [128]).

If we consider the Government’s approach in light of this then it appears that while an ‘exceptionally close link’ can be interpreted as requiring ‘additional elements of dependency’, it can also be read as encompassing cases where there is ‘real, committed and effective support’. Bringing forth legislation based on the concept of an ‘exceptionally close link’ may thus run the risk of reintroducing the very approach that was rejected by the Court of Appeal in IA. This is clearly not what the Government intends. Yet the adoption of different language in legislation from that which is currently used in the case law inevitably raises the spectre of further ambiguity, and consequently litigation, in respect of the meaning of family life. Again, this is clearly contrary to what the Government intends.

(iii) Parents and Children Only Model

As I have observed previously, a final possibility is that the legislation might reflect the approach stated by the Home Secretary ie. purporting to narrow ‘family life’ to ‘parents and their children’. If this approach is adopted, then the legislative provision would be incompatible with the Convention unless it is framed in a manner which enables the courts to read it compatibly using section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Introducing legislation that needs to be read compatibly using section 3 in order to ultimately arrive at a position that is already established in the case law is clearly convoluted and undesirable.

It will therefore be interesting to see what happens to the Government’s proposal in the light of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in IA. One possibility is that this aspect of the reform proposal will quietly fall away. If, however, legislation is brought forward then it will be necessary to examine whether it simply reflects the current law or whether there will be an attempt to redefine family life, a prospect that currently appears to be neither necessary nor desirable.

In its 2025–26 term, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship.

Oral arguments are expected to take place in the spring of 2026; the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

Although the executive order is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision, USCIS has issued guidance outlining how the order would be applied and enforced, if upheld.

In January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14160, which aimed to place restrictions on birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who were present in the country temporarily or without lawful status. The order would significantly abridge the long-standing constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for virtually all children born in the United States, as recognized in the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The order has not yet taken effect; multiple lawsuits produced preliminary injunctions in the lower courts. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published an implementation plan in July, outlining how the order would be applied.

Background on EO 14160

Section 1 of the executive order provides that a child born in the United States would no longer automatically be entitled to citizenship at birth in two situations: (1) when the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; or (2) when the mother’s presence was lawful but temporary (for example, under the Visa Waiver Program or on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

EO 14160 directs federal agencies to withhold citizenship documentation for such births, with the policy applying prospectively thirty days after the order, while clarifying that it does not affect, for example, children of lawful permanent residents. The order frames this position as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 8 U.S.C. § 1401’s “subject to the jurisdiction” language.

Legal Challenges to EO 14160

Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the executive order on birthright citizenship as unconstitutional under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment (the “Citizenship Clause”). Federal district judges in Washington State and Maryland entered injunctions blocking enforcement while the cases proceeded. In late June, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court curtailed federal district courts’ use of so-called nationwide (universal) injunctions, without resolving the order’s constitutionality, and litigation continued in the lower courts.

Following CASA, in Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction and an order granting provisional class certification, which prevented the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a certified class of babies born on or after February 20, 2025, who otherwise would be denied U.S. citizenship under the executive order. And in State of Washington v. Trump, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the executive order was “invalid because it contradict[ed] the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

In September 2025, the Trump administration’s lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court for review. The Trump administration’s certiorari petition requested that the Supreme Court review both Washington and Barbara; however, the Court’s order of December 5, 2025, indicates it will only take up the issue in Barbara. The case, expected to be argued in the spring with a definitive ruling to be issued by the end of June or early July 2026, will likely determine the future of birthright citizenship in the United States.

USCIS’s Implementation Plan for EO 14160

Although the EO is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Barbara, USCIS’s implementation plan, released on July 25, 2025, outlines how the order would be applied if it were ultimately upheld. The memo explains that “unlawfully present” refers to people in the United States without permission or those who have stayed longer than allowed, as defined in Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It also explains the difference between “unlawful status” and “unlawfully present.” For example, people paroled into the United States might not have a lawful immigration status, but they are not considered unlawfully present if they have permission to stay from the attorney general.

Since the term “lawful but temporary” presence isn’t clearly defined in the INA, USCIS has provided its own definition. This includes people who are in the United States legally for a limited time or under conditions that require them to reapply for continued stay. Examples include nonimmigrants, parolees, temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries, and deferred action recipients. USCIS also addresses the status of children born in the United States to parents with lawful but temporary status. These children do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents are not U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or U.S. nationals. To avoid negative immigration consequences for these children, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and USCIS propose allowing them to register and acquire the lawful status of at least one parent.

This proposal is similar to existing provisions for children of foreign diplomats born in the United States, who can acquire lawful immigration status through registration. Until this proposal is implemented, DHS suggests deferring immigration enforcement actions, including detention, removal, or deportation against these children, even though they may not be recognized as U.S. citizens under the proposed policy.

If the constitutionality of the executive order is upheld, a U.S. birth certificate alone would no longer suffice as proof of citizenship. Parents would need to provide documentation of the mother’s lawful status or the father’s citizen or permanent resident status.

Next Steps

With the executive order’s enforcement currently halted, the future of this policy remains uncertain. The Supreme Court will determine whether to uphold EO 14160, with significant implications for foreign nationals in the United States, depending on the scope of the ruling. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June or July of 2026.
