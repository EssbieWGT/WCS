Federal officials claim the officer acted in self-defense when he opened fire on Renee Nicole Macklin Good, 37, as her car moved forward during an apparent confrontation with several officers.

But local leaders quickly called the shooting unjustified, vowing to probe whether his actions violated state law.

The courts may be forced to parse the facts. Before that, so must investigators.

“As a prosecutor, I know that it’s easy for people on the outside to draw conclusions based on limited evidence,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who recently served a yearlong term as deputy attorney for Hennepin County, where the shooting occurred.

“But we really do have to have a little patience so the people who see more than we do can make an evaluation,” he said.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) said Wednesday that “if anyone broke the law” he would do everything in his power to ensure they’re “held accountable.” Meanwhile, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty (D) said her office was “pushing hard” for a local investigation — the “only way” to ensure “full transparency and review” of the incident.

Federal law enforcement officers have significant legal protections when acting in the course of official duties, but they aren’t ironclad. If federal officers violate federal law or their actions aren’t “necessary and proper” to fulfill their federal duties, courts have said they can face state charges.

Video footage shows Macklin Good’s car surrounded by three officers, with one telling the woman to “get out of the f‑‑‑ing car,” while one masked officer repeatedly pulls on the driver-side door handle. The masked officer who ultimately fired the shots approaches the car from the front and begins to draw his weapon as the car turns its wheels — beginning to drive away from the officers.

Three shots ring out, starting as the officer is in front of the car and continuing as it passes to his side. With Macklin Good shot, the car then careens to the side of the road, crashing into a parked car.

Minnesota’s use-of-force laws allow state police to use deadly force where a reasonable officer would believe such force is necessary to protect themselves or others from death or serious injury. Federal law likewise permits deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person poses the immediate threat of death or serious harm.

Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-Md.), who prosecuted police excessive force cases as a state’s attorney for Prince George’s County, said any case would likely come down to whether the officer followed department guidelines in how he responded.

“When you prosecute these cases, the issue is going to be, was it consistent with this training and with the departmental standards?” he told The Hill.

“I would think that at a minimum, he violated the training and rules that they’re supposed to follow in the way that he got in front of the car, drew the weapon and started firing,” Ivey said.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has clear guidelines for dealing with someone in a vehicle. Officers are barred from firing “warning shots” at someone in a car, even if only to disable the vehicle. And officers are largely “prohibited from discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle” and are required to think about the safety of their fellow officers and any bystanders when they do so.

The firing officer’s moves also appear to run counter to DHS training, which directs officers to approach vehicles in a “tactical L” formation to prevent crossfire and instructs them to never get in front of a vehicle.

“You should never come in front of a car when you’re trying to stop it. And he knew that they were trying to stop the car, because the officer on the other side was trying to open the door to get to the keys. So this was stupid, to walk in front of the car,” Ivey said.

He noted the shots were fired in proximity to other officers and numerous bystanders who were recording the incident.

“It was really stupid to fire the gun with that many people around, especially since there was no felony,” Ivey said. “You’re only supposed to use deadly force when somebody’s life is in danger, and certainly not for any kind of misdemeanor issue. And at the time they were trying to get her out of the car, I’m not even sure there was a criminal offense that had been committed.”

But Rachel VanLandingham, a national security law professor at Southwestern Law School, said while she did not think the officer’s use of force was justified, the issue can be more complicated in court, where juries are asked to consider the officer’s reasoning.

“It seems like she backed up and was trying to go around him, right? That she wasn’t trying to hit him. … But those standards still have to be — they have to reasonably believe that she poses an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death,” VanLandingham said. “It’s from his perspective, the shooter’s perspective.”

“It’s not as clear-cut of an analysis, I think, as people want to make it out,” she added.

“It’s really based on this concept of reasonableness, reasonableness from that officer’s perspective, which is why in so many of these excessive police force cases that the balance goes legally to that officer,” VanLandingham said.

Trump administration officials have made clear they view the incident as a matter of self-defense.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the firing officer was hit by the car, a detail difficult to ascertain from the video. She maintained the officer had followed his training, while arguing a car can be a deadly weapon, going so far as to suggest Macklin Good was committing an “act of domestic terrorism.”

“The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” Noem continued. “He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.”

The ICE officer could attempt to mount a similar defense if he’s prosecuted, contending his actions fell within his official duties and were neither unreasonable nor unlawful. His attorneys could also attempt to move the prosecution to federal court and claim he is immune from prosecution.

But a future state criminal prosecution may already face hurdles.

Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) was assisting the FBI in its investigation, but the federal agency changed course, revoking the BCA’s access to case materials and forcing the state agency to withdraw from the probe.

Osler described the move as “unusual,” saying he’s not aware of a similar situation where federal authorities cut the state out of an investigation altogether. It could pose problems for local prosecutors, especially as several witnesses to the incident are federal employees.

“Going forward, there’s basically three things that can happen,” he said. “The state can wait for the FBI report. They can ask the state authorities for a report based on the evidence that they do have. Or they could make a charging decision without a police report.”

Drew Evans, superintendent of the BCA, said the agency can’t meet the investigative standards required by Minnesota law without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected. He said he expects the FBI to share its full file with the appropriate prosecuting authorities at both the state and federal levels.

The Hennepin County attorney’s office said in a statement that it began exploring options to ensure a state-level investigation can continue “immediately” after the FBI rescinded its cooperation agreement with the BCA.

“If the FBI is the sole investigative agency, the State will not receive the investigative findings, and our community may never learn about its contents,” Moriarty said.

The FBI declined to comment when asked about the case files.

The Hill asked the Minnesota attorney general’s office if the change affects its plans.

If a criminal prosecution does not come to fruition, Macklin Good’s family would face an uphill battle in any pursuit of civil damages.

ICE officers are generally covered by qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement and other government officials from liability in civil lawsuits unless legal challengers can show the defendant violated a “clearly established” statutory or constitutional right.

VanLandingham said she fears the shooting will be used by the administration to erode policing standards used during peacetime that generally prohibit officers from firing first.

“I’m afraid there’s going to be a growing — this is contributing to a narrative by the administration that we have war in our city streets,” she said

“Just policy and socially, domestically, you know, concerns aside, legally, if we’re at war, our government agents can use lethal force first versus last, based on who someone is.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/ICECriminalCivilLiability_Beitsch-Lee_AP_TomBaker.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-10 05:57:27.607084

Yesterday, federal agents shot and wounded two people in Portland, Oregon, during a traffic stop.

AMNA NAWAZ: It came just one day, after the fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis stoked outrage and anger.

And, as special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro reports, new cell phone video deepened the debate over ISIS conduct.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: New video emerged today showing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good and her wife just moments before Good was fatally shot in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

WOMAN: You want to come at us?

I say, go get yourself some lunch, big boy.

Go ahead.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was reportedly taken by the federal agent who fired the shots and showed what happened next.

(GUNSHOTS) FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Earlier today, Good's wife released this statement saying, prior to being killed, they'd -- quote -- ""stop to support our neighbors.

We had whistles.

They had guns.""

MARY MORIARTY, Hennepin County, Minnesota, Attorney: We do have jurisdiction to make this decision that happened in this case where her life was taken in Hennepin County.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Meanwhile, Hennepin County attorney Mary Moriarty said Minnesota would be conducting its own investigation into the shooting and called on members of the public to send any evidence directly to her office.

The move came after federal officials reversed course and shut out state investigators.

MARY MORIARTY: It does not matter that it was a federal law enforcement agent.

I can say that the ICE officer does not have complete immunity here.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: President Trump addressed the investigation this afternoon from the White House.

QUESTION: Do you believe that the FBI should be sharing evidence with state officials in Minnesota?

DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: Well, normally, I would, but they're crooked officials.

I mean, Minneapolis and Minnesota, what a beautiful place, but it's being destroyed.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: More than 1,000 protesters took to the streets here last night, calling for ICE's removal from the city.

RACHEL HOPPEI, Minneapolis Protester: Get out of here.

We don't want you.

You have no right to be here.

You're destroying our communities.

Just leave.

CINDY SUNDBERG, Minneapolis Protester: ICE is tearing us apart.

They're making people disappear.

They're not following the law.

And that's not Minnesota.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also spoke today and pushed back against the notion that the city is unsafe.

JACOB FREY (D), Mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota: Fifty percent of the shootings that have happened thus far in Minneapolis this year have been ICE.

In other words, we have only had two shootings.

One of them has been ICE.

We are a safe city.

ICE is making it less so.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Protests also erupted in Portland after Border Patrol agents shot and wounded two people on Thursday, a shooting Portland's Mayor Keith Wilson described as reckless.

KEITH WILSON, Mayor of Portland, Oregon: Today, I want to say clearly that we stand with Minneapolis, we stand with Minnesota, we stand with Chicago, we stand with L.A., we stand with every community that is hurting in our nation.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The Department of Homeland Security said the shooting in Portland took place during a targeted vehicle stop and alleged that the targets were undocumented immigrants with ties to a notorious Venezuelan gang.

But Portland's police chief, Bob Day, said he had no information on the two people shot.

BOB DAY, Portland, Oregon, Police Chief: This is not any way, shape or form of immigration-related on our end.

We do not know the facts of this case.

We are simply providing that traditional investigative support and perimeter support.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Back in Minneapolis, schools remain closed today and officials have offered students the option of remote learning through mid-February.

WOMAN: Time to go!

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That follows a large confrontation just hours after Wednesday's shooting between immigration enforcement agents and community members outside a South Minneapolis school.

NICOLE LUNDHEIM, Minneapolis Parent and Teacher: Before I know it, I'm being attacked, pushed and pulled.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Nicole Lundheim had just arrived to pick up her daughter after school and captured the melee on her phone.

WOMAN: Step up!

Step up!

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The Department of Homeland Security said agents were chasing a U.S.

citizen who impeded their work and the pursuit ended at the school.

It said no students or staff were targeted but that a man calling himself a teacher assaulted officers.

Lundheim recalls the episode very differently.

NICOLE LUNDHEIM: Is -- it almost seemed intentional to create -- to linger long enough to create a crowd, to create chaos.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And with reports of immigration enforcement efforts continuing across the Twin Cities today, Lundheim says the level of concern is rising.

NICOLE LUNDHEIM: So students who are immigrants, students who aren't immigrants, students who have legal standing to be here, but maybe are Black or brown, they are afraid because they could become in the crosshairs, because their best friend, their aunt, their uncle, family members -- like, the fear is visceral.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Fear that may only rise in coming days, as federal officials say they will reexamine the cases of more than 5,000 refugees living in the state, just the latest move in a widening immigration crackdown here.

Geoff Bennett: And, David, video of the shooting spread almost instantly.
David Brooks: Yes, let me talk first about the public debate, and then about the event, which Jonathan was talking about.
Geoff Bennett: David Brooks, Jonathan Capehart, thank you both, as always, for your insights.
Jonathan Capehart: Thanks, Geoff.","Geoff Bennett:

This week saw a fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by an ICE agent and fresh signals of the Trump administration's emerging vision of U.S. leadership.

Time now for the analysis of Brooks and Capehart. That's New York Times columnist David Brooks and Jonathan Capehart of MS NOW.

It has been a week, gentlemen. It's good to see you both.

So, Jonathan, this week marked a grim turning point, as an ICE agent, as you both well know, shot and killed a U.S. citizen during an enforcement operation as part of President Trump's expanded immigration raids. Your reaction to all that's unfolded?

Jonathan Capehart:

It's a tragedy. Excuse me. It's a tragedy that's been unfolding in other communities around the country.

I think Governor Walz, Minnesota Governor Walz was correct when he said to the president, these federal agents, these ICE agents, they're not making us safer. You are making the community, our citizens, more afraid.

And why shouldn't they be afraid? Not just because of what happened to Renee Good, but the way they have been operating, not just in Minneapolis, but in other cities across the country, unmarked cars, unidentifiable, masked. People don't know who these people are who are lunging at them on streets, lunging at them in their cars.

And so I think that the indignation, or, as I say, the righteous indignation that we have heard from state and local officials, from the governor, most definitely from the mayor, I think is warranted. And anyone giving Mayor Frey, Minneapolis Mayor Frey the blues for being very explicit in what he wants ICE officers to do, how he feels about this, which is more unconscionable, him dropping the F-bomb or having a person who lives in his city killed by federal agents no one asked for?

The mayor didn't ask for them. The governor didn't ask for them.

Geoff Bennett:

And, David, video of the shooting spread almost instantly. And just as quickly, the White House and DHS moved to label it an act of domestic terrorism, that the ICE agent, they said, was acting in self-defense.

What does this whole thing reveal about how narratives are being set before investigations are even complete?

David Brooks:

Yes, let me talk first about the public debate, and then about the event, which Jonathan was talking about.

In 1951, there was a brutal football game between Princeton and Dartmouth. And after the game, researchers sent the Princeton kids and the Dartmouth kids film, the exact same film video of the game. And the Princeton kids said, look, this film proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Dartmouth kids did twice as many penalties.

And the Dartmouth kids said, this film proves without a shadow of a doubt that the Princeton kids did all the penalties. And so they were looking at the same video. And it's a very famous social science experiment. And I watched it play out in real time this week, because every single Trump person on my feed, my social media feeds was saying, this proves he shot her with just cause.

And every single anti-Trump person on my feed said it was murder. I did not see one exception. And so I think what this tells us is the norm, which is essential to democracy, of putting the truth above your party and your team, that norm is eviscerated, at least on social media, hopefully not in real life.

As to the events of what actually happened, I'm not going to render a judgment on what happened, because we're going to have an investigation. I will leave it to them. And I hope Minnesota has full information to do the investigation.

But what Jonathan said is absolutely correct., that the atmosphere that ICE has created is incendiary, that people who have power and have guns are supposed to exercise restraint, and they are doing the opposite. And the crust of civilization is thin. And once people with guns and with power began acting like thugs, well, then things are going to spiral. And that's what we have seen.

Geoff Bennett:

Jonathan, to David's point about the public debate, it does feel like we live in this moment where this idea of seeing is believing has been replaced by what you believe now determines what you see.

Jonathan Capehart:

I mean, sure, but, I mean, maybe I come at this from the vantage point of being an African American man who, for decades, people talked about racial profiling by police officers, and there was no video to prove it. And so we were deemed reactionary. We were deemed taking things too seriously, being hyperbolic, until the person videoed Rodney King getting beaten up in Los Angeles.

And even with that, people came at it with their various perspectives. Five years ago in Minneapolis, we saw Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of George Floyd for 9.5 minutes. Imagine if the young woman who videoed -- who recorded that with her phone, if that video had not been there what the narrative would have been, the narrative that they tried to spin, even in the face of that video.

We now have a new video out of Minneapolis, out of Minnesota where -- I mean, I take your point, David, depending on your political perspective, you see what you want to see, but you're seeing. And I think that the idea that the secretary of homeland security, the vice president of the United States, and the president of the United States are out there saying things that, whether -- you have got eyes.

You just match the video up against what they're saying. Put aside your politics. There is -- they are not trying to push that car out of the snow. It's a lie. And so I say all of that to say, I applaud people who are going out into their communities, seeing what's happening, and pulling out their phones and recording it.

As we have seen, multiple people were recording what happened to Renee Good. And good for them, good for Minneapolis, good for Minnesota, but also good for America, because, as long as people are bearing witness to this with their phones and putting out a record, then the administration from the president on down cannot lie, baldly lie, to the American people without there being video evidence that they are lying.

Geoff Bennett:

Let's shift our focus to foreign policy because President Trump is making clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he teases a takeover or a reimagining of the Western Hemisphere.

Here's what he told your paper, The New York Times, when asked if there are any limits on his global powers. Mr. Trump said: ""Yes, there is one thing, my own morality, my own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me. I don't need international law. I'm not looking to hurt people.""

David?

David Brooks:

We're doomed.

(Laughter)

David Brooks:

Relying on Donald Trump's morality, we're doomed.

Sometimes, I think he's just trying to keep the reality show going, and every week has to show some sign of force. But I tried to put my mind in, like, what -- if I want to make the best case for this Venezuela operation, obviously, Maduro was one of the worst people in the world.

The best case, I think, is that Trump happens to be in an office when a lot of really terrible regimes are crumbling, and he is a destructive force, and he is having some effect on causing terrible regimes to crumble. And that's true in Iran. The story is amazing what we're seeing in Iran. It's true with Hamas. It's true with Hezbollah. It's true in Venezuela, Cuba.

There are a lot of terrible regimes that are in a very weak position. And if he can push them off the edge, maybe that will be good for the world. The problem with this approach is what Stephen Miller now famously said to Jake Tapper on Monday, which is, we don't believe in international law. We believe in power. We believe in force. Strong wins. Might makes right. Deal with it.

The problem with that, it's like the ICE thing, frankly. When there's restraint, when there's rules, when there's order, it does cause people to be less violent. Between 1990 and 2014, in the world, there were less than an average of 15,000 war deaths per year, 15,000. Since 2014, there have been over 100,000 war deaths per year around the world.

That is what you get when you erode the postwar international order. You allow savagery to reign. And what he's doing with this Stephen Miller might makes right, that's what you get.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you see it, Jonathan? If the administration is reviving this 19th century great power view of the world and abandoning the post-World War II order the U.S. helped build, what's the result?

Jonathan Capehart:

Chaos?

I mean, I look at what he did in Venezuela and ask, to what end? If it's regime change, is it really regime change if all you -- if the only thing you have done is remove the leader and leave the regime in place? And so when you think about it that way, I now wonder, OK, how much will the United -- will the American people be asked to do in Venezuela to hold that country together so that President Trump can go and get the oil?

Geoff Bennett:

How should the American people judge whether this approach is making the country safer or simply more feared?

David Brooks:

Well, more feared.

I mean, it is making the country more feared. If there was somehow -- their logic -- and, again, I'm trying to be fair to the Stephen Millers of the world. Their logic is that it doesn't matter what they believe. It doesn't matter what the party in Venezuela believes.

As long as we can intimidate them with -- by behaving roughly toward them, then they will do what we want, which is to let us build up the country and we will take the oil. The amorality of that, people -- my friends on the left, they used to say, you have to see through what George W. Bush is doing. He's waging war for oil.

Now you don't have to guess. Donald Trump just says it. And so that's a world of amorality.

Renee Nicole Good died on Wednesday after an ICE agent shot her through her car window. Her death, as well as another shooting by federal agents in Portland on Thursday, prompted demonstrations across the country against ICE.

Federal officials have accused Good of attempting to run over an ICE agent ahead of the shooting, but local and national leaders dispute that claim based on videos of the incident.

Good was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.

Activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was recently released after a nine-month detention at an ICE facility in Aurora, addressed the crowd from the steps of the Capitol. Protestors spilled into Lincoln Street between 14th and Colfax avenues and onto the snowy lawn, prompting road closures in the nearby blocks.

“People are ready for a revolution. People are ready to stop ICE,” Vizguerra said, leading chants of “Free them all,” referring to detained immigrants, and encouraging people to protect one another as they continue protests.

The group marched from the Capitol down the 16th Street pedestrian mall towards Union Station. Protestors told Newsline that they thought Good’s death was “criminal” and it felt the federal government is “covering it up” with its insistence that the shooting was in self defense.

Gov. Jared Polis called for an investigation into the shooting in a statement this week.

“What took place in a Minneapolis neighborhood is deeply disturbing, and the loss of Renee Good is tragic. My thoughts are with Renee’s family, especially her young child, friends, and loved ones including those in Colorado,” he said. “The American people deserve answers about what happened.”

More protests and vigils are planned in Colorado for this weekend, including on Sunday at the ICE office in Centennial. The protests follow previous demonstrations in Colorado and across the county over the past year against the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-protestjan9-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 02:56:44.086267

“Plaintiffs’ reading of the Supreme Court’s Dec. 23 ruling is that it creates a straightforward path to judgment as a matter of law in their favor,” the filing stated.
When the lawsuit was filed in October, National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas had already been “federalized” and were assembling at bases for imminent deployment.
Now, those forces have been largely demobilized, though some 195 Illinois National Guard troops remained in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as of this week “completing the demobilization process,” which is expected to conclude next week.

The status filing in U.S. District Court comes two weeks after the high court’s denial of a request from the Trump administration to allow the Republican president to deploy troops to Illinois streets while a court battle over a restraining order plays out.

In the filing, lawyers for Attorney General Kwame Raoul said that although the Supreme Court’s ruling made no final determinations, it “effectively resolves as a matter of law” that the federalization and deployment orders by Trump were illegal.

“Plaintiffs’ reading of the Supreme Court’s Dec. 23 ruling is that it creates a straightforward path to judgment as a matter of law in their favor,” the filing stated.

While Illinois’ attorneys said they are prepared to proceed with summary judgment proceedings before U.S. District Judge April Perry, such litigation could be costly and drawn out, and the state is open to discussing other possible resolutions, the filing stated.

That posture is based partly on a dramatic change in circumstances. When the lawsuit was filed in October, National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas had already been “federalized” and were assembling at bases for imminent deployment.

Now, those forces have been largely demobilized, though some 195 Illinois National Guard troops remained in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as of this week “completing the demobilization process,” which is expected to conclude next week.

The filing also made note of Trump’s social media post on Dec. 31 announcing he was ordering the National Guard removed from Illinois, which also threatened: “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!”

Quoting from settled case law, the lawyers for Raoul said Trump’s “voluntary cessation of the contested conduct” is only binding if it’s “absolutely clear” the wrongful behavior will not recur.

Lawyers for the Department of Justice, meanwhile, asked for more time to decide how to proceed, saying they were “continuing to evaluate the implications of the Supreme Court’s recent stay decision,” which potentially affects pending cases in Oregon and California.

In the same status filing, the DOJ asked for one-month extension to file a response to the complaint, which the attorney general’s office has opposed.

The divided opinion by the conservative-majority Supreme Court represented a significant political victory for Gov. JB Pritzker and other Democratic governors in their escalating battle with Trump over his authority to go against their wishes and use federalized troops on U.S. soil to assist immigration enforcement personnel carrying out the president’s mass deportation efforts in Chicago and other American cities.

“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the high court’s order said. “Thus, at least in this posture, the Government has not carried its burden to show that (the law) permits the President to federalize the Guard in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois.”

Three of the court’s conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, lodged dissents, with Thomas and Alito writing that the court “has unnecessarily and unwisely departed from standard practice.”

The fight landed at the Supreme Court days after Perry issued a temporary restraining order barring Trump from deploying Guard troops to the state.

That order has since been continued indefinitely pending the resolution of the lawsuit.

He argued state and federal law enforcement officials should cooperate with each other no matter which side requests help.
Murkowksi in an interview with The Hill called on federal and state officials to try to ease the tensions that are only becoming more inflamed by political jousting.","Republicans on Capitol Hill are expressing skepticism over Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s handling of the Trump administration’s response to an Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shooting a woman Noem has said was committing an “act of domestic terrorism.”

Noem’s hasty characterization of the shooting as an entirely justified use of federal force against a woman who “weaponized” her vehicle has raised questions on Capitol Hill and differed in tone from other senior administration officials.

“It was very unusual to have a senior law enforcement official to draw a conclusion about an event where the scene was still being processed,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said of Noem’s conclusion that the shooting was in response to a domestic terrorism incident.

“I believe that she gave the president advice — and I hope she’s right. But generally speaking, law enforcement would recognize that a life was lost, that families are changed forever, the shooter’s life will change forever, we’re collecting video, we’re trying to assess the situation,” Tillis said.

“That didn’t happen,” he added. “Either Secretary Noem has a lot of information that she will share with us in the coming days that formed a basis for advising the president, or she communicated too soon.”

Other senior Trump administration officials, notably border czar Tom Homan, have had a more measured response to the shooting — stopping well short of labeling Renee Nicole Macklin Good’s actions domestic terrorism.

Homan said he wanted the investigation “play out” before drawing conclusions.

“It’d be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation,” he told “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil. “Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.”

The jarring video of the shooting of Macklin Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, as she tried to evade ICE officers in her Honda Pilot has sparked protests around the country.

President Trump initially told a group of New York Times reporters that Macklin Good was at fault because she tried to “run over” the ICE officer, calling it a “vicious situation.”

But then the president appeared to soften his view after watching a slow-motion video of the incident in the Oval Office.

“Well … I — the way I look at it … ” Trump told the Times reporters before shifting away from his earlier rhetoric.

“It’s a terrible scene,” he said. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”

Public officials in Minnesota, including Gov. Tim Walz (D) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D), have slammed the Department of Homeland Security’s justification for the shooting as “propaganda” and “positively ridiculous.”

They are pushing for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to investigate the shooting to determine if it was justified or was a crime.

Walz said Thursday that the Trump administration has blocked the state criminal agency from investigating and urged officials to allow state investigators access to evidence.

Some Republicans are challenging Noem’s claims that Minnesota state investigators “don’t have any jurisdiction” over the shooting, something that state officials also dispute.

Tillis said local investigators should be part of the investigation into the shooting of Macklin Good, a U.S. citizen.

“I think you have to have local authorities, because at the end of the day, you got to calm the nerves of the local community,” he said.

Tillis said he has a “huge problem” with “sanctuary cities” such as San Francisco and Chicago refusing to cooperate with federal authorities on the enforcement of immigration law. He argued state and federal law enforcement officials should cooperate with each other no matter which side requests help.

“This would be in the reverse,” he said. “I really give the [local] police chief a lot of credit for saying what a great relationship he has with FBI and federal resources who are typically on the ground. Any time that you separate them, then you are diminishing the goodness they achieve together.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she’s concerned about reports that the Department of Homeland Security is shutting the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension out from the investigation.

“I did find that a little confusing and concerning. It seems like the state authorities are being iced out of it — no pun intended — which just seems unusual,” Murkowski.

Murkowski in a post on social media called for a “thorough and objective investigation.”

“The videos I’ve seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing. As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened — which will require full cooperation from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, along with local authorities,” she said.

“We need to ensure ICE officers have the necessary training to safely — and with empathy and respect for human life — carry out these activities,” she said.

Murkowksi in an interview with The Hill called on federal and state officials to try to ease the tensions that are only becoming more inflamed by political jousting.

She said the “amped up” environment reminds her of the nationwide protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.

“People are so agitated about things. It kind of takes you back to the George Floyd days and how things just built and built and built. We don’t need a replay of that,” she said.

Murkowski called on public officials to “de-escalate some of the rhetoric around there.”

“When you have it appear that, ‘Well, this is only going to be a federal investigation and no state involved,’ it just allows for suspicions that are unnecessary,” she said.

Walz questioned whether an investigation led by Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel will produce a “fair outcome.”

“It feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” he said.

The Hill reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Several other Republicans have called for a full investigation of the shooting and have declined to comment until more information is shared with the public.

“I think there needs to be an investigation, and I think they’re doing that,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said. “Anytime there’s a death, there needs to be an investigation.”

Ernst said she’s “fully in support” of operations to deport immigrants in the country illegally but called the shooting “unfortunate and tragic.”

The Iowa senator noted there have been “escalating levels of threats against ICE officers,” which has inflamed tensions between law enforcement officers and local communities.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, said it’s “clear” that “there’s going to be an investigation.”

“I’m sure there will be several,” he said. “I’m sorry it happened, but I’m not going to jump to conclusion about the facts. I’m going to withhold judgment until I know what the facts are.”

Noem announced the FBI will conduct the investigation, but Democrats on Capitol Hill are asking whether the Trump administration will handle it impartially.

“There’s a sense of outrage, and particularly that’s fueled when you see the president and the others in the administration basically deny — like, ‘don’t believe your lying eyes about what you saw in these eyewitness videos,’” said Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat.

Smith said the refusal of Noem and the FBI to allow the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to participate in the investigation of the incident “deeply concerning.”

“This is deeply concerning, because yesterday they said it would be a joint investigation led by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is the state investigative unit, and the FBI and now they’re backtracking from that,” she said.

“They’re blocking the BCA from participating in the investigation, which is unacceptable. Clearly people are not going to accept a [Department of Justice]-led investigation when the folks in the administration have made it clear that they’ve already [decided] what happened here,” Smith said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/MinneapolisICE_Bolton_AP-MinnPublicRadio_BenHovland.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-10 02:56:27.972643

“They’re trying to break us,” said Democratic state Rep. Emma Greenman, whose district is roughly a mile from where the shooting occurred.
For some in Minnesota, what made Good’s shooting especially tragic was that they saw something like it coming.
That was, Pritzker believed, exactly what the Trump administration wanted so it could declare martial law.
A state Democratic lawmaker, however, said the Republican attacks all feel “very personal.” “Donald Trump has vendettas — he goes after people.","Two days before Christmas, with federal agents ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stepped to a microphone and issued a warning.

“I am increasingly concerned because of the chaos that is being caused by these ICE agents,” Frey said. “Somebody is going to get seriously injured or killed.”

Two weeks later, with some 2,000 federal agents — more than three times the number of police officers employed by the Minneapolis Police Department — deployed to the state, that very thing happened. A federal immigration officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, on Wednesday, unleashing a national furor, pitting federal and local officials against each other and drawing thousands of people to the streets in protest.

Wednesday’s deadly confrontation was the culmination of weeks of intensified scrutiny, verbal attacks and even conspiracy theories directed at Minnesota and Gov. Tim Walz by President Donald Trump, his administration and his allies.

Exactly why the president has been so fixated on Minnesota isn’t totally clear, though local officials and strategists working in state and national politics have pointed NBC News to Trump’s long-running — and unsuccessful — attempts to win the state and his personal disdain for Walz. (Trump, however, has repeatedly falsely claimed that he did win the state.) Many said it’s a case of Trump going after deep-blue cities in part due to their immigration policies.

A central focus of the administration’s attacks on Minnesota has also been the Justice Department’s yearslong fraud investigation that has involved some members of Minnesota’s Somali community.

In 2022, during President Joe Biden’s administration, federal prosecutors announced initial indictments in what they called a $250 million scheme to defraud a federal child nutrition program. They described Aimee Bock, who is white, as the mastermind of the operation. A jury convicted her in March. So far, prosecutors have charged 92 people and dozens have been convicted.

But conservative influencers have latched onto the scandal to push unsubstantiated claims, and Trump has used it to make disparaging remarks about people of Somali descent.

For Minnesotans, the result of all this attention has largely been disgust, fury and exhaustion.

“They’re trying to break us,” said Democratic state Rep. Emma Greenman, whose district is roughly a mile from where the shooting occurred. She said she believes the administration targeted the state because it is “a successful story of multiracial democracy and immigration — and it inherently represents a threat to authoritarian power.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Trump “loves Minnesota and the people.”

“It’s a state where he received historic Republican support, and he has long called out Walz for his incompetence and terrible leadership.”

“I wish they would just leave us the f--- alone,” Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told NBC News on Wednesday.

Asked why Trump was so fixated on the state, Smith replied, “I wish I knew.”

'He's never gotten Walz'

Trump has called Walz “corrupt,” “whacked out” and “grossly incompetent.” On Saturday, the president shared a video on social media that promoted a conspiracy theory about a Democratic lawmaker in the state who, along with her husband, was assassinated in June. The video falsely implied that Walz had something to do with the killing.

Trump has also repeatedly made derogatory comments in recent weeks about Somali immigrants in Minnesota, calling them “scammers” and “lowlifes.” While the fraud investigation into the use of federal social services funds in Minnesota has received bipartisan support in the past, Somali Americans who run child care facilities, which have been the subject of fresh allegations in the scandal, in the state say they’ve been harassed and threatened since a conservative influencer’s lengthy video on the issue went viral.

Many Democrats in the state have acknowledged that its party leaders have mishandled the situation politically as well. A state audit report released in 2024 found that failures by the state’s Education Department led to the misuse of the Covid-era program.

On Monday, Walz made the surprise announcement that he would no longer be running for re-election amid the scrutiny and pressure.

A former senior White House official who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Trump has long been mystified by why then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in 2024.

“He’s never gotten Walz. Never gotten it,” the official said, saying Trump and his team believed someone like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would have been a stronger choice.

For some in Minnesota, what made Good’s shooting especially tragic was that they saw something like it coming. Bringing in federal agents, against the wishes of the state’s political leaders — and many of its residents — was a bomb waiting to go off, Frey and Walz said Wednesday.

“What we’re seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It’s governing by reality TV, and today that recklessness cost someone their life,” Walz said in a news conference. “Now we hear more political rhetoric. Enough. Enough is enough.”

Frey called the incident “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable” and told Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “get the f--- out” of Minneapolis.

On Fox News on Wednesday night, Vice President JD Vance declared that Walz should resign. He also made an admission.

“Look, I’ve beaten up on Tim Walz enough. I don’t want to do it anymore on your program,” Vance said. “I almost feel bad for the guy, except for the fact that he should have seen this,” he said, referring to the fraud allegations.

On Thursday, however, Vance joined Leavitt at the press briefing, where he again went after Walz.

“Tim Walz is a joke,” he said. “His entire administration has been a joke, the idea that he’s some sort of freedom fighter. He’s not. He’s a guy who has enabled fraud, and maybe, in fact, has participated in fraud.” There is no evidence that Walz participated in alleged fraud.

Leavitt also said the administration wouldn’t be taking its eye off Minnesota.

“The Department of Homeland Security will continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state under the failed and corrupt leadership of Democrat Gov. Tim Walz,” she announced.

Tensions, years in the making

Trump’s focus on Minnesota can be traced to 2016, when he first toppled the so-called blue wall and won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — and saw Minnesota as potentially within reach. Republicans have not won Minnesota in a presidential election since 1972.

In the view of one Democratic strategist who has worked in Minnesota, “the Trump folks thought if they squeezed Minnesota, they could turn it red.” Preya Samsundar, a Minnesota-based Republican strategist, noted Trump’s long-held goal of turning the state red and described the president’s attention and effort as a “poke in the eye” to Walz.

“I think for a lot of folks, Minnesota is still one of those states that can be attainable with the right effort,” said Samsundar, a former Midwest regional communications director for the Republican National Committee. “I think now a part of the White House’s focus is because Tim Walz was a VP candidate from a state that Trump has wanted to flip for some while.”

Until abandoning his campaign for a third term, Walz had been positioning himself as one of the Democratic Party’s future leaders, “making him a convenient person to go after,” Samsundar added.

Indeed, Trump’s criticism of Walz intensified after Harris chose him as her running mate. Trump frequently assailed Walz as a “dangerously liberal extremist.” Walz, for his part, emerged as the Democratic ticket’s chief attack dog against Trump, further attracting his ire.

After Trump won, he and his allies lumped Minnesota in with other Democratic states that, he said, weren’t aggressive enough on immigration.

Minnesota is home to the nation’s largest Somali population, and most of them are U.S. citizens. Since 1993, thousands of people have fled war and instability in the East African country.

As Trump has ramped up ICE actions across the U.S., the community, mostly based in the Twin Cities, has been the target of the agency’s efforts in Minnesota. And Walz hasn’t held his tongue regarding ICE, slamming it last year as Trump’s “modern-day Gestapo.”

On Wednesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a longtime Walz ally, called the governor to remind him to keep in mind what he was dealing with: a Trump administration that lies, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.

Pritzker also reupped a playbook he had shared in the past with Walz and other Democratic governors, which was to repeatedly remind his state’s residents that it was their right to protest the government but not to “take the bait” and descend into violence. That was, Pritzker believed, exactly what the Trump administration wanted so it could declare martial law.

Later Wednesday, Walz conveyed that to his residents, imploring them not to “take the bait.”

“They want a show,” Walz said at his news conference. “We can’t give it to them.”

Unfolding fraud allegations

Meanwhile, a broad fraud scandal has been unfolding in the state involving the alleged misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal welfare funds. The allegations pertain largely to the Somali community. Trump has repeatedly said the Somali community has “destroyed Minnesota“ and “our country,” and his Justice Department is sending additional federal prosecutors to the state to assist the U.S. attorney’s office there with the ongoing investigations into the matter.

Republicans in the state and at the national level have blamed Walz for not taking the allegations seriously.

“The fraud is a powerful issue because it’s a real-life example of what the majority of Republicans and independents already feel is true — that their tax dollars are wasted by politicians and people taking advantage of the system,” said Matt Wolking, a longtime GOP strategist who was on Trump’s 2020 campaign.

A state Democratic lawmaker, however, said the Republican attacks all feel “very personal.”

“Donald Trump has vendettas — he goes after people. Clearly that’s a piece of this,” the person said.

“The city is emotionally fatigued,” added Roy Temple, a national Democratic operative with decades of experience in Minnesota politics, who said that, even six years later, the city is “still healing” from the George Floyd murder and fallout.

“People’s nerves are pretty shot,” Temple said, adding that the ICE raids and the fatal shooting are “triggering.”

Complicating part of the picture, however, is the scope and potential severity of the allegations of fraud.

Other Democrats in the state agreed with the sentiment that Trump was unfairly attacking many elements of Walz’s record and dumping on the Somali community — while also acknowledging the possibility that Walz hasn’t handled the situation well.

“This has been in the air in Minnesota for some time; it’s one of those things that we knew at some point this issue would really kind of percolate to the top. And we’re seeing that happen now, where a spotlight is put on this — for multiple reasons,” a Minneapolis-based Democratic operative said. The operative added that Walz’s “biggest problem” with the fraud allegations was that “he just didn’t really have any good answers for any of this.”

At a separate hearing in Congress this week on the Minnesota fraud issue, Democrats fumed about the hypocrisy of Trump administration officials who, while complaining about fraud and ICE protests in Democratic areas, pardoned fraudsters aligned with the president as well as those convicted of violence against federal officers on Jan. 6, 2021.

Republicans in the state largely defended Trump’s message — though not necessarily his tone — expressing solidarity with efforts to unroot fraud and tackle immigration enforcement.

“The national attention that the president has brought to Minnesota means that people are listening now,” state GOP Chair Alex Plechash said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-tim-walz-vl-1220p-8bc968.jpg",N,,2026-01-10 02:56:36.920691

On Saturday, January 3, 2026, the Trump Administration conducted a major military operation in Venezuela, without Congressional authorization or notification, to depose and arrest Nicolás Maduro, leading to further instability in the nation. TPS is designed to protect immigrants from nations destabilized by war, violence, or natural disasters from deportation back to unsafe conditions.

“Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS…are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger—conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro,” the Members wrote. “Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.”

“While Maduro was captured and brought to the United States to face justice, his criminal accomplices remain in power,” wrote the Members. “We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado.”

The lawmakers’ full letter to Secretary Rubio and Secretary Noem is available HERE and below:

Dear Secretary Rubio and Secretary Noem:

We write to urge you to immediately restore Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans following the Trump Administration’s military action in Venezuela. Conditions in the country are deeply unstable and dangerous, and the still-intact Venezuelan regime, emboldened by support from the President of the United States, has doubled down on repression and brutality since taking power.

The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved. This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now. This termination of lawful status has caused unimaginable fear and anxiety for law-abiding Venezuelan families, who passed criminal background checks, earned work permits, and paid fees and taxes.

Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS are set to lose their employment authorization, which will have devastating economic consequences for essential sectors in Florida and across the country. Many are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger—conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro.

This administration has not just abandoned Venezuelans in the diaspora, they have abandoned the Venezuelans that remain in Venezuela, who yearn for freedom and a democratic transition. While Maduro was captured and brought to the United States to face justice, his criminal accomplices remain in power, including de facto interim president Delcy Rodriguez, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello (who was indicted alongside Maduro in 2019). We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado.

The worst fears of the Venezuelan community were confirmed as President Trump stated that Delcy Rodriguez will be empowered to “make Venezuela great again” and underscored that his objective was extracting oil resources from the country rather than ending the suffering of Venezuelans and promoting a peaceful, democratic transition of power.

In the days since the U.S. military operation commenced, which included missile and drone strikes in densely populated areas of Caracas that damaged residential buildings and injured innocent bystanders, the Venezuelan regime has enacted a new law criminalizing any expression of support for Maduro’s exit from the country. Dozens of people have been arrested and jailed, including journalists, for sending text messages or issuing social media posts related to the news. Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.

In light of these developments, we urge you to immediately rescind the revocation of TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries and extend these critical protections for law-abiding Venezuelans who are genuinely fearful of being sent back to the same murderous regime under new management.

An immigration judge issued a decision in Demirtas’ favor a week earlier, but she made the ruling contingent on a federal court process.

His arrest at a routine immigration check-in and his 48-day detention reflected some of the Trump administration’s hardline enforcement tactics since the Republican took office a year ago pledging to deport 1 million people per year.

“I did grow a lot through this process, but we lost a lot emotionally and mentally,” said Mae Bovenzi, Demirtas’ wife. “I hope both of our mental health goes back to normal. I feel like we’ve been so misinformed, and I’ve seen the constitutional rights that are being stripped away right in front of my eyes.”

The couple, who married in May, missed their first holiday season together because of the ordeal, but they plan to “celebrate in their own way now,” his wife said. She added she was grateful for all the support her family received.

“My body didn’t want to go to sleep last night because I’m afraid I’ll dream I’m back there in jail,” Demirtas said about his first night home.

Demirtas was arrested Nov. 20 when he complied with an order to appear at a routine ICE check-in in San Diego at the downtown federal Edward Schwartz courthouse.

He was among hundreds who were arrested in California last year while appearing at immigration check-ins or court hearings.

His background would have made his detention improbable during the Biden administration. He is married to a U.S. citizen and has a pending green card application. He does not have any criminal history, a Department of Homeland Security attorney confirmed during a bond hearing last week. He’s from a country with a human rights record that the State Department has criticized, and he arrived in the United States after fleeing religious persecution. He said in court filings he was tortured in Turkey because of his religious beliefs.

Despite that background, and an immigration judge ruling he could be released on bond on Dec. 30, Demirtas remained detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center until the district judge granted his habeas petition and he was released Tuesday night.

Attorneys are increasingly turning to federal courts to secure their clients’ release because of disruptions to the immigration court system. The Trump administration has fired more than 100 immigration judges nationwide, according to the National Association of Immigration Judges.

In California, more than a quarter of federal immigration judges have been fired, retired or quit since Trump’s inauguration in January 2025. In San Francisco, at least 12 immigration judges have been fired or left without clear explanations, exacerbating a 100,000-case backlog in the region it covers.

A spokesperson for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the courts, said her office declines to comment on personnel matters.

‘Unforgiving system’

In July 2025, the Trump administration issued a directive that required mandatory detention for almost all noncitizens who entered the United States without authorization.

“Based on how unforgiving the immigration system is right now, great people are just giving up,” said Matthew Holt, Demirtas’ immigration attorney. “It’s sad to see it after the generational sacrifices they’ve made.”

Holt and other attorneys have said the new system of detaining more people, and not letting them out on bond or parole is like a “war of attrition,” a military strategy where one side wears the other down by exhausting their resources and morale.

In September, some 7,079 immigration court cases nationwide ended with a voluntary departure, which allows a person to leave the country within a certain time frame and usually carries less penalties than a deportation order. That’s the highest number ever recorded in a single month, according to data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which holds information on cases going back to 1997. For cases in California, that total was 408.

“I personally have experienced people with meritorious claims, or what could be meritorious claims, before the hearing, before their testimony, say, ‘I want an order of removal. I want to leave. I can’t take it anymore,’ ” said Jeremiah Johnson, a former immigration judge in San Francisco, who was fired Nov. 21 by email without explanation.

Federal judges rule against detention

A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment. Previously, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stressed that Demirtas had entered the country illegally.

“To be clear, having a pending application with USCIS or the possibility of being eligible for a green card does not grant anyone legal status,” McLaughlin said about the case.

A Department of Homeland Security budget document from 2024 says it costs on average $217 per day for ICE to detain someone in San Diego, meaning U.S. taxpayers paid about $10,416 for Demirtas to be detained before the agency finally agreed to release him.

Before President Donald Trump’s second term, the federal lawsuits known as habeas corpus were not regularly used in immigration cases. Habeas corpus is the constitutional right that ensures that people have a chance to challenge their imprisonment in front of a judge.

In 2025, hundreds of habeas cases were filed in the Southern District of California, and thousands were filed for detained immigrants across the country. So far in 2026, about a dozen such cases have already been filed in the Southern District of California, according to habeasdockets.org, a site that tracks such filings.

Federal judges have been systematically rejecting Trump’s policy of mandatory detention. In one recent filing in the Southern District of New York, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan noted noncitizens have won their habeas petitions in 350 of 362 cases in federal district courts. He wrote that “160 different judges sitting in about 50 different courts spread across the United States” handed down the rulings.

New postings for ‘deportation judges’

Immigration courts operate underneath the executive branch, not the independent judicial branch that oversees federal courts. The courts are housed under the Justice Department, which gives the Trump administration more authority over immigration judges. Unlike in criminal courts, attorneys are not appointed for those who cannot afford legal representation.

The Department of Justice recently began advertising open positions for “deportation judges,” particularly for employees located in San Francisco, Santa Ana, Sacramento and Los Angeles, where applicants are invited to “combat fraud and ensure those seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in our immigration system are not successful.”

A Department of Justice spokesperson said the effort was aimed at “restoring integrity to our immigration system.”

“After four years of the Biden Administration forcing immigration courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety,” she wrote in an emailed statement.

The Trump administration has also temporarily assigned military lawyers to act as judges in immigration cases, which some experts say could violate posse comitatus, the 19th century law that defines what the military can do on U.S. soil.

Video captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross gives a raw, up-close perspective of the pivotal moments surrounding his fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis.

A Department of Homeland Security official confirmed the video, obtained by CNN, was recorded on the agent’s cellphone camera; the video was originally obtained by the conservative Minnesota media outlet Alpha News.

Vice President JD Vance shared it, saying it shows the officer was endangered.

“Watch this, as hard as it is. Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn’t hit by a car, wasn’t being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense,” Vance posted on X.

The video begins with Ross in front of the vehicle driven by Good, who had stopped her burgundy SUV perpendicular to the street, obstructing the flow of traffic. Ross does not say anything as he walks across the front of the car toward the driver’s side of the car.

As he rounds the car, Good can be seen with her window down looking directly at the officer.

In the video, Good then talks to Ross.

“That’s fine dude. I’m not mad at you,” she says. Ross does not respond. In the car window a reflection can be seen of Ross, holding his phone up, as he continues to walk. You can also hear the victim’s wife, Becca Good, say “show your face” to Ross.

The video shows Ross walking around to the back of the car. Becca Good, the passenger in the car, who had gotten out of the vehicle prior to the confrontation, tells Ross that, “We don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. This will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.”

She holds a cellphone up to Ross’s face as she addresses Ross.

“You wanna come at us? You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,” she says to Ross. She then tries to get back in the car, but the door is locked.

You then hear another officer tell Good, the driver, to “get out of the fucking car.”

Good is then seen reversing the car and glancing forward as she turns the steering wheel to the right, away from where the officer is standing. The car moves forward, and Ross cries out “whoa” and then three gunshots are heard in rapid succession.

The video does not show if the SUV made contact with Ross, as the camera angle jerks up to the sky. An earlier video shot by a bystander shows that the SUV may have made contact with Ross as it lurches forward, and he moves to the side.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the newly released video backs up what the agency has said – that the ICE agent acted in self-defense.

“This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along – that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement. The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defense. The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,” McLaughlin said in a statement on Friday.

The shooting itself is not visible, but three gunshots are heard as the phone in his hand jostles further and then is facing the house behind Ross.

The camera then captures the SUV as it barrels forward. Someone can be heard uttering “fucking bitch.”

The impact of the SUV crashing into a parked car can be heard as well as the camera pans down to the street.

Mark Pocan says Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs more oversight and less funding in response to the killing of a woman in Minneapolis this week.
On Wednesday, an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in her vehicle, sparking protests in the city and across the nation.
On WPR’s “Wisconsin Today,” Pocan criticized ICE’s lack of oversight from the Trump administration or Republican-controlled Congress.
They think they’re above the law,” Pocan said.
“We want to keep the values of America intact and those values are not what we’re seeing executed — and I use that word specifically — with ICE,” Pocan said.","Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan says Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs more oversight and less funding in response to the killing of a woman in Minneapolis this week.

On Wednesday, an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in her vehicle, sparking protests in the city and across the nation. The Trump administration claims the officer acted in self-defense. Minnesota leaders like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are accusing President Donald Trump and federal officials of lying about the shooting.

On WPR’s “Wisconsin Today,” Pocan criticized ICE’s lack of oversight from the Trump administration or Republican-controlled Congress.

“ICE is a rogue agency, right? They think they’re above the law,” Pocan said. “They’re told they have impunity, that they can do anything. And we’re seeing those actions unfortunately unfold.”

Pocan said video footage of the shooting clearly shows Good’s vehicle turning away from agents, not toward them, and that officer Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent identified as the shooter, continued firing even after the car was driving away from him.

“We want to keep the values of America intact and those values are not what we’re seeing executed — and I use that word specifically — with ICE,” Pocan said. “This is something that needs greater control. Clearly, Republicans in Congress are not doing that. Perhaps come November, we’ll be able to make some changes.”

Pocan mentioned that ICE’s funding could face additional scrutiny should Democratic lawmakers take control of the House in this year’s midterm elections. Last summer, Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which nearly tripled ICE’s annual budget from $9.9 billion to $28 billion.

Seeking clarity on what’s next in Venezuela

Pocan also told “Wisconsin Today” that the Trump administration’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from Caracas this month was illegal, according to both American and international law.

Pocan highlighted that Article I of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war and said Trump operated without the approval of legislators. Pocan said lawmakers received a briefing from officials this week but that he found it uninformative.

“I don’t think they know what the next steps are,” Pocan said. “How much money are we going to spend? Will there be boots on the ground? How long are we going to be there? All of that should worry people greatly.”

Earlier this week, Trump said he expects U.S. involvement in Venezuela could last years in order to build up the nation’s oil infrastructure.

On Thursday, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson told WPR the operation marks a reinstatement of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century policy that claims the entire western hemisphere under American influence.

Pocan said that shift would be bad news for constituents he hears from who are concerned about the affordability of health care and groceries.

“Anything that suddenly puts us in the imperialism business, starting to occupy countries, that’s costly and that doesn’t make sense,” he said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ap_j_scott_applewhite_-_pocan-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 21:56:40.216319

I'll be honest, it didn't take long for the fresh, excited energy I was trying to bring into 2026 to be quashed. (But maybe that's on me — I forgot to put ""attack a foreign country and seize its leader with only the murkiest of communications about what might come next"" on my ""out"" list this year.)

But this week, I want to talk about two other stories that, when juxtaposed, paint a striking picture of how some people are grappling with life under the second Trump administration.

First, a kind of ridiculous one: the petitions to deport Nicki Minaj.

Have you all heard about this? More than 120,000 people have signed petitions calling for the rapper cum right wing political activist to be deported to her home country of Trinidad. Minaj was brought to the U.S. by her parents as a young child, and has spoken in the past about not being a U.S. citizen. And in recent months, she's angered large portions of her fan base by praising Donald Trump and the broader MAGA movement, after being outspokenly against the first Trump administration's family separation policies. (There's a whole lot of other stuff people don't like about Minaj, which you can read about here.) One of the petitions asserts that deporting her ""would serve as a reminder that public figures need to be accountable for their words and the broader impact they have on diverse communities.""

I read about all that a day before an ICE officer shot and killed a woman, Renee Nicole Good, in Minneapolis.

There are, predictably, diverging accounts of what led to the shooting. The federal government says that it was an act of self-defense against Good, who they allege was attempting to drive her car into ICE agents. State and local officials are, quite literally, calling bull****. The mayor of Minneapolis described the event as ""an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed."" He then, uh, politely requested that ICE ""get the f*** out of Minneapolis."" There is likely to be weeks of fallout as the federal and local governments clash over the continued presence of ICE in Minnesota, and the repercussions of Wednesday's violence.

So what do these stories have to do with each other? To me, they illustrate the contradictions that come up when people try to cherry pick applications of the law. The signers of the Nicki Minaj deportation petitions seem to be deeply offended by her embrace of the Trump administration. (""If [Minaj] believes in supporting the agenda that all illegal immigrants should be deported no matter what they bring to this beautiful country then what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Good riddance homophobic Nicki,"" one petitioner commented.) But in calling for her deportation, they are tacitly accepting a key bit of MAGA logic — that a person's political ideology can and should be grounds for their removal.

If you accept that, then you may also have to accept that deporting people is something that requires a force of agents — agents whose job is to remove people from the country.

The mobilization comes in response to the escalation of ICE violence in our communities, the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old wife and mother of three, and the months-long pattern of unchecked violence and abuse in marginalized communities across America. Across the country, communities will gather in nonviolent, lawful, and community-led actions to honor the life lost, demand accountability, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

Good and the Portland victims are part of a broader and deeply alarming pattern of unchecked violence and abuse by federal immigration enforcement agencies. In September, ICE reportedly shot and killed Silverio Villegas González, a father and cook from Mexico living in Chicago. In 2025 alone, more than 30 people have reportedly died in ICE detention.

ICE OUT FOR GOOD WEEKEND OF ACTION GOALS

Coalition members are mobilizing to:

Honor and humanize the lives taken by ICE

Demand accountability, transparency, and an immediate investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Good

Expose the broader pattern of ICE violence, including deaths in detention

Call for ICE to leave our communities

Build public pressure on elected officials and federal agencies

Create space for grief, solidarity, and collective action

Strengthen local connections and neighborhood response systems

Leaders from the partner organizations issued the following statements:

INDIVISIBLE

“Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today. This weekend, people across the country are coming together to grieve, honor those we’ve lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long. ICE’s violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent.”

— Leah Greenberg, Co-Executive Director of Indivisible

POPULAR DEMOCRACY

“Every person ICE has killed had a family, a community, and a life that mattered. Pouring billions of public dollars into a rogue enforcement agency that terrorizes our communities while denying people health care, housing, food security, and education is morally indefensible and profoundly reckless. This cruelty flows directly from the agenda of fear and punishment pushed by extremists like ​​Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, embraced and strengthened by the President himself. We demand accountability for the killing of Renee Nicole Good and for the countless lives lost at the hands of ICE. The lesson is clear: this violence will not stop until ICE is abolished.”

— DaMareo Cooper, Executive Director, Popular Democracy

ACLU

“The shootings in Minneapolis and Portland were not the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, but they need to be the end. These tragedies are simply proof of one fact: the Trump administration and its federal agents are out of control, endangering our neighborhoods, and trampling on our rights and freedom. This weekend Americans all across the country are demanding that they stop.”

— Deirdre Schifeling, Chief Political and Advocacy Officer, ACLU

50501

“This weekend’s actions are prompted most immediately by the tragic death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, and her murder at the hands of ICE is unspeakable. We will uplift her this weekend, and we will uplift all those in our communities whom ICE has targeted and brutalized, from Silverio Gonzales to Marimar Martinez to all of those people in marginalized communities whose names must not be forgotten. This is our moment. We must conjure the souls of our brave ancestors and remember we stand on the shoulders of giants.”

–Sarah Parker, 50501 Spokesperson and Executive Director, Voices of Florida Fund

MOVEON CIVIC ACTION

“For a full year, Trump’s masked agents have been abducting people off the streets, raiding schools, libraries, and churches. As ICE’s unnecessary, reckless, and escalatory deployment goes unchecked, the killing of civilians will only continue. None of us want to live in a country where federal agents with guns are lurking and inciting violence at schools and in our communities. This is why MoveOn members will be uniting once again this weekend in peaceful, nonviolent, powerful protests in stark contrast to the unrepentant, ruthless violence of this administration.”

–Katie Bethell, MoveOn Civic Action Executive Director

PUBLIC CITIZEN, NOT ABOVE THE LAW COALITION

“Masked, power-hungry federal agents are treating the streets of America like the Wild West. The intimidation tactics, the deadly attacks against our communities and the brazen lawlessness by immigration enforcement must stop now. As ICE and border patrol agents commandeer neighborhoods, people in detention centers, in ICE custody or simply in their own personal vehicles fear for their lives. This militarization of immigration enforcement is endangering everyone. What’s more alarming is the Department of Homeland Security, the vice president and president of the United States are endorsing ICE and CBP’s violent behavior. The Trump Administration must stop ICE deployment now, we must deeply investigate this unjust killing, and the American people must file peacefully into the streets to resist this illegal, overreaching use of government power. We must stand together to effectively defend ourselves.”

– Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen and co-chair of the Not Above the Law Coalition which formed the Disappeared in America Campaign.

NDLON

“We immigrants know what authoritarian violence is. Many of us come from countries where we had to endure the kind of hatred and terror we saw in Minneapolis. Many of us fled brutal regimes to seek survival here.”

“We grieve for Renee Nicole Good and all the victims of this Administration’s shameful and senseless brutality — the growing list of the dead and injured. But we are not just sorrowful. We are defiant. We, the people, will stand together against all efforts to dehumanize us, polarize us, terrorize us and kill us.”

“They want to provoke us into responding to violence with violence, to meet hate with hate. They are desperate to justify their cruelty with ever more brutality.”

“But we immigrants know how to confront authoritarianism. We will resist the government’s attacks by building community, by documenting atrocities, by protesting nonviolently, by showing kindness and solidarity at all times. We will meet them in the streets, in the courts, at the day labor corners. We will meet them everywhere. And we will win.”

“We are not afraid or discouraged. And we will not be defeated. The more we stand together as a community of determination and love, the harder it will be for them to divide and destroy us.”

-Pablo Alvarado, Co-Executive Director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network

THE WORKER’S CIRCLE

“The tragic killing of Renee Good — a U.S. citizen exercising her fundamental rights — by a federal ICE agent is not just a catastrophic loss for her family and community; it is a stark warning to all of us about where unchecked power leads. This administration’s expanding use of force against our neighbors erodes the very rights and safety that define who we are as a nation. As a Jewish organization, we know what unchecked power has done in the past. We must not let that take root here, today. Now, more than ever, we must demand transparency, accountability, and policies that protect human life, human dignity and civil liberties for everyone. Allowing federal forces to act without independent oversight undermines justice and threatens the safety of us all.”

– Ann Toback, CEO, The Workers Circle

UNITED WE DREAM

“Using your first amendment rights to speak out and show up for your neighbors during the growing anti-immigrant violence in our cities should be a protected constitutional right, not a death sentence. This brutal killing is a horrifying reminder of the threat armed forces pose to our collective safety, especially at a time when local, state and federal officials have consistently called on the federal government to invest in the resources working families truly need —health care, housing, access to food— instead of indiscriminate terror in our communities. Billions poured into immigration raids for the sake of ripping apart communities in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis does nothing but lead to irreparable damage, violence and death. In 2025 alone, 32 people died in immigration detention. We demand an immediate end to this cruelty and for elected leaders at every level to speak out in defense of immigrant communities and our shared safety.”

– United We Dream

VOTO LATINO

“Under Donald Trump’s leadership and Kristi Noem’s direction of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE has become more aggressive, more reckless, and more deadly — with 2025 marking its deadliest year in two decades. The killing of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, is not an isolated failure but the predictable outcome of a political agenda that rewards force and dehumanization.”

“Trump and Noem have normalized the erosion of constitutional rights, framing brutality as enforcement and accountability as weakness. Their rhetoric and policies have sent a clear message down the chain of command: push limits, ignore safeguards, and expect protection from consequences. This is not about partisan politics — it is about defending human life and the rule of law. We stand with Renee Nicole Good’s family and with communities nationwide to demand accountability and to stop the unchecked enforcement born of Trump and Noem’s leadership before more lives are lost.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 21:57:06.560998

Federal officials have not publicly named the agent, but said he was injured in another case in June, when he was pulled along by a vehicle that sped off during an investigation.

In court records from a case with details matching that incident, an agent named Jonathan Ross suffered a ""substantial wound"" on his arm while trying to detain a Guatemalan migrant.

Ross needed more than 50 stitches, and had abrasions on his knee, elbow and face, according to the court papers.

Ross has worked with ICE in Minnesota since 2017, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.

The Indiana National Guard also confirmed that Ross was deployed to Iraq for one year in late 2004 with Headquarters Company, 138th Signal Battalion. He was with the National Guard until 2008.

During his deployment, Ross received the Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.

Federal officials have said the ICE agent who killed Good acted in self-defence, an account rejected by state officials based on videos.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News the officer had received dozens of stitches and ""abrasions all over his body"" on 17 June, while trying to arrest a ""child sex offender"".

At a White House press briefing on Thursday, Vice-President JD Vance said the officer ""nearly had his life ended"" when he was ""dragged by a car six months ago"".

US media, citing unnamed sources, also reported that the officer in the June case is the one who shot Good.

As an ICE agent, he is a member of a specialised response team, which, according to the agency, works with high-risk warrants and deportations of dangerous criminals.

The June incident also took place in Minnesota, where, according to federal court records seen by the BBC, Ross and several other agents were trying to apprehend a Guatemalan man, Roberto Carlos Muñoz.

When Ross told the driver to lower his window and open his door, Muñoz refused.

Ross reached into Muñoz's vehicle with his right hand and attempted to unlock the driver's door. Muñoz drove up on the kerb and accelerated away. Ross's right arm was caught in the vehicle and he was dragged along with it.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/711a/live/56e36650-ed52-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.png,N,,2026-01-09 23:56:24.708169

The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that Good legally petitioned to change her name from Renee Nicole Macklin to Renee Nicole Macklin Good to share names with her current partner.
“What took place in a Minneapolis neighborhood is deeply disturbing, and the loss of Renee Good is tragic,” Polis said in a released statement.

About a thousand people gathered at the Colorado State Capitol and marched around downtown Denver on Friday to protest the recent killing of a woman by ICE in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The 37-year-old victim, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, was from Colorado Springs and attended Corando High School.

“There has to be something that we can do and fight up against. Because if we can't, then it goes against everything that our founding fathers stood for,” Rachel Sloan said. “I don't understand how we can think that this is okay, for our whole government to just be hiding behind these lies that they're spreading. She's a human being.”

Among the speakers at the protest was immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was recently released after nine months at the GEO detention center in Aurora last month. She led the crowd in chanting “abolish ICE.”

Vizguerra was allowed to post a $5,000 bond and will remain free while her deportation case continues.

“I felt it was really important to bring awareness here and also to show that we stand in solidarity with the folks in Minneapolis, but also with the folks around the country currently protesting,” Mckenzee Hales, an organizer of the protest, said.

Good was shot and killed in her Honda SUV by ICE agents. She moved with her partner to Minneapolis from the Kansas City area months ago.

The Coloradan was married twice. She shared a six-year-old with her second husband, Air Force veteran and comedian Timothy Macklin, Jr., who passed away in 2023. In speaking with the Associated Press, he first husband asked to remain anonymous for the safety of their children, who are ages 15 and 12. Her current partner, who remains anonymous and was on-scene when the shooting occurred, said that Good was her wife. The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that Good legally petitioned to change her name from Renee Nicole Macklin to Renee Nicole Macklin Good to share names with her current partner.

Good’s Colorado connection has sparked reactions and protests throughout the state. Governor Jared Polis called for a full investigation into Good’s death.

“What took place in a Minneapolis neighborhood is deeply disturbing, and the loss of Renee Good is tragic,” Polis said in a released statement. “My thoughts are with Renee’s family, especially her young child, friends, and loved ones, including those in Colorado. There must be a full investigation into this incident and accountability. The American people deserve answers about what happened today.”

When asked if Good’s connection to Colorado made the killing hit closer to home? “The fact that she's a person hit home to me,” Sloan said.

Protests of about the same size have broken out across the state, and more are scheduled for the weekend.

According to KKTV, 30 protesters gathered at the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office, Wednesday night. On the same night, protesters in Fort Collins gathered in front of the Hilton Inn Fort Collins to show solidarity with Minneapolis.

Leadership in the Civil Rights Division, overseen by Harmeet Dhillon, informed staff in the division's criminal section that there would not be an investigation, two sources said. Normally, after a high-profile incident involving a fatal shooting by an officer, attorneys from the criminal section fly out to the scene. Multiple career prosecutors offered to do so in this case, but they were told not to do so, one of the sources added.

While investigations into the excessive use of force can be pursued solely by a U.S. Attorney's office without direct involvement from the Civil Rights Division, it is customary for the division's federal prosecutors to take the lead on high-profile investigations like the one in Minnesota.

The decision also raises questions about how far the FBI's investigation into the shooting will go.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

On Thursday, the Justice Department announced that the FBI was leading the investigation into the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

Video footage shows the officer, identified in court records from a prior incident as Jonathan Ross, fired three rounds at the car as Good started to drive away.

The video also appeared to depict the officers did not take immediate steps to ensure that Good received emergency medical care after the shooting took place. A separate video from the scene showed officers stopping a man who claimed to be a doctor from moving toward Good.

The killing has sparked protests nationwide, including in New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Detroit.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has argued that Ross was acting in self-defense, and claimed that Good was trying to use her car as a weapon in an act of ""domestic terrorism.""

That description sparked immediate backlash from state and city officials, with the mayor of Minneapolis labeling the self-defense claims as ""bulls***.""

On Friday, Trump administration officials shared another cellphone video of the incident that sources say was recorded by the ICE officer. The White House argues this video shows Ross was hit by Good's car.

The Justice Department has stopped short of claiming Ross was acting in self-defense.

But in a statement to CBS News this week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that the use of deadly force by law enforcement officials can sometimes be justified.

""Federal agents risk their lives each day to safeguard our communities. They must make decisions, under dynamic and chaotic circumstances, in less time than it took to read this sentence,"" Blanche said.

""The law does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm. Rather, they may use deadly force when they face an immediate threat of significant physical harm,"" he added.

The criminal section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division specializes in investigating and prosecuting constitutional violations by law enforcement officers.

Some of the most common investigations involve excessive use of force, but can also include other things such as sexual misconduct, false arrests or deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.

One of the most famous civil rights prosecutions by the section in recent years took place in Minneapolis, after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in May 2020.

Chauvin pleaded guilty to willfully depriving, while acting under color of law, Floyd's constitutional rights, as well as the rights of a 14-year-old boy.

Since President Trump took office last year, the Civil Rights Division has scaled back its work on excessive force prosecutions, according to legal experts.

Last year, it sought to downplay the conviction of a former Louisville police officer who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights and asked a federal judge to sentence him to serve just one day in prison.

The judge ultimately sentenced him to serve 33 months.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/09/c5b6a701-aa1e-4e86-9e30-bca0c7985009/thumbnail/1200x630/035146d191bbb9a48a195ce7a97123d0/gettyimages-2255300615-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 21:56:47.499146

Widely distributed videos from Wednesday show an ICE agent draw his gun and shoot 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good in her SUV.

President Donald Trump and members of his administration said the ICE agent was acting in self defense. Minnesota leaders like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are accusing Trump and federal officials of lying about the shooting.

But the incident has sparked thousands of people to protest across the U.S., including in Wisconsin.

In Madison, hundreds of people stood on the steps outside the state Capitol just after sunset for a rally led by the immigrant-rights group Voces de la Frontera.

Protestors sang songs as they waved signs and held candles. Among them was Jonathan Beers of Madison.

“(I’m) tired of being told which neighbors to be afraid of,” Beers said.

Another Madison resident, Deborah Elsas, wore a black baseball cap over her shoulder-length white hair. It read “Abolish ICE.” She called this a “very scary time.”

What happened to Good was “cold-blooded murder,” said Janine Shefte, a Menominee Falls resident, who travels to Madison to visit her son and attend protests.

Shefte said ICE needs to stay out of Wisconsin.

“Keep your nose in your federal stuff,” Shefte said. “You leave immigrants alone. I am Indigenous, so everybody’s a colonizer. I don’t understand how they hate people who belong here.”

Friday’s demonstrations, including events in Madison, Milwaukee, La Crosse and Appleton, were not the first this week. Protesters Wednesday night gathered in Green Bay and Milwaukee outside of a local ICE headquarters. A candlelight vigil was held Thursday night in downtown Oshkosh.

Milwaukee marcher: ‘I think it is a turning point’

In Milwaukee, hundreds marched throughout downtown for more than an hour on Friday night. Protesters chanted “Justice for Renee Good” and some held signs that said “ICE out of our communities” and “Stop ICE Now.”

Katharine Reid of Wauwatosa said she was “devastated” when she heard the news of the shooting.

“(I) haven’t been the same since, and no one that I know is unaffected,” Reid said.

Reid said it was encouraging to see how many other people showed up to the demonstration to speak out against the shooting.

“I think it is a turning point, and it is galvanizing people to recognize that they have to take more action,” Reid said.

Cudahy resident Teri Knight also came to the protest with her friend.

“I guess I don’t understand how people can’t be out here,” Knight said while she was walking down Wisconsin Ave. “It’s the only way to make any change, aside from calling people.”

Ben Dombrowski, an organizer with the No Kings Milwaukee Area Coalition, spoke to hundreds of people who gathered at Cathedral Square Park before a short moment of silence was held for Good. He called for the Milwaukee community to “hold the line.”

“So if ICE considers putting armed men in our streets, they will quickly find that these streets are our streets,” Dombrowski said. “Milwaukee belongs to the people.”

La Crosse veteran: ‘(I) never dreamt that we would see this in this country’

In downtown La Crosse, about 50 people gathered to demonstrate at noon Friday. Those protestors held signs along a busy intersection outside of City Hall. Some members of the group said they have been gathering every Friday for months to protest against the Trump administration.

Ted Yankee from West Salem said his reaction to Good’s death was “horror.”

“(I) never dreamt that we would see this in this country,” he said.

Yankee, a Coast Guard veteran, carried an upside down American flag, saying he hoped to communicate that the country “is in distress.” He said he does not understand the push to remove immigrants from the country.

“Immigrants are what make up this country, and we need immigrants,” Yankee said. “So much of what they provide is good for the country; it’s not bad.”

La Crosse-area resident Margaret Larson said she has also been frustrated by the Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants, refugees and migrants.

But she said Good’s death felt different from the last 11 months.

“After this happened, I started thinking, ‘It’s open season on all of us,’” said Larson, who carried a sign reading, “We are Renee.”

Larson said she hopes this is “a tipping point” that stirs more people to speak out against the administration.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260109_NOICE01-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 21:57:16.386439

On December 24, 2025, an ICE officer shot Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins in his vehicle in Glen Burnie, Maryland, causing him to crash.
Local and federal authorities should support one another’s efforts to thoroughly and impartially investigate Good’s killing, Human Rights Watch said.","(Washington, DC, January 9, 2026) – The killing of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer on January 7, 2026, was unjustifiable, Human Rights Watch said today. Three videos of the incident shared on social media, verified by Human Rights Watch and media outlets, clearly contradict federal officials’ claims that the woman “weaponized her vehicle” or attempted to kill officers before an agent opened fire.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers confronted the 37-year-old US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, on a residential street in south Minneapolis, which a witness said Good was blocking with her car. As Good attempted to drive away from the officers, one shot her three times at close range. A statement by Good’s wife in a local media outlet indicated the two had been alerting neighbors of ICE’s presence. “We had whistles,” the statement said. “They had guns.”

“Over the past year, ICE and other federal agents have been abusing immigrant communities across the United States with impunity,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. “This horrific incident is the latest sign that their abusive tactics put lives at risk, including people not subject to immigration enforcement.”

Human Rights Watch analyzed three videos of the shooting and one of the immediate aftermath and reviewed four witness accounts on local media outlets.

In a video shared on social media by a Minnesota Reformer reporter and later published by NBC News, Good is in the driver’s seat of a burgundy Honda Pilot, stationary in the middle of the road, as unmarked vehicles attempt to pass. Good appears to signal at them to go around. One vehicle does, and she signals for a second vehicle to pass, but it stops perpendicular to Good’s car. Two officers get out and walk toward Good, shouting: “Get out of the car.”

One of them tries to open the driver’s seat door by grabbing the handle and then reaching inside the window. A third officer approaches from the passenger side. Good briefly reverses in an apparent attempt to get away from the officers. The third officer walks to the driver’s side as Good begins to turn and drive in the opposite direction of the officers. Pulling out his gun, the third officer fires three shots in short succession at eye level, first through the windshield, then through the driver’s seat window. Good’s car speeds up and crashes into a parked car a short distance away.

A second video of the incident, filmed by the shooting officer, shows Good turning her steering wheel and accelerating away from the officers. Good and her vehicle are then out of frame as the officer fires his gun. A third video of the incident is consistent with this analysis, showing Good’s vehicle pulling away from the officers as gunshots are heard.

Video analysis shows that when the shots were fired, the officer could not have reasonably feared death or serious physical injury.

In another video filmed afterward, a bystander standing across the street of Good’s car asks: “Can I go check a pulse? I’m a physician.” One officer refuses. Good can be seen, still inside the vehicle, bloodied and motionless, while several officers stand around the vehicle without making an apparent effort to provide immediate medical support.

The Minneapolis city government reported that police officers who responded to the incident found Good with “life-threatening gunshot wounds” and Minneapolis firefighters provided medical attention until paramedics arrived. Two witnesses told media that the ICE vehicles parked in the street impeded the ambulance, forcing paramedics to reach Good on foot from the end of the block. The city government reported that Good later died in the hospital.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) quickly issued a statement claiming that Good tried to kill ICE officers with her vehicle in “an act of domestic terrorism.” This account is entirely inconsistent with any reasonable analysis of the video footage, Human Rights Watch said.

Good’s killing comes amid increased deployment of federal immigration officers to Minneapolis.

Thousands of people gathered at a vigil on the night of January 7 to honor Good’s memory and protest ICE’s presence in Minneapolis. The shooting has sparked demonstrations in other cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle.

Good’s killing fits a broader pattern of incidents involving the use of firearms under questionable circumstances during immigration enforcement operations, Human Rights Watch said. On December 24, 2025, an ICE officer shot Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins in his vehicle in Glen Burnie, Maryland, causing him to crash. DHS claimed that Sousa-Martins had “weaponized his vehicle,” ramming into ICE vehicles and driving it “directly at ICE officers.” While footage of the shooting has not circulated, a local police statement calls DHS’s account into question, asserting that a second man injured in the crash was not a passenger in Sousa-Martins’ car, as DHS said, but was instead injured while detained in an ICE vehicle.

In October, in Chicago, a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agent shot Marimar Martinez five times. The next day, Martinez was criminally charged and accused of striking a CBP vehicle with her car, but the case was dismissed. In September, an ICE officer shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez near Chicago, claiming he “drove his car at law enforcement officers.” But CCTV footage does not show his car driving at or hitting law enforcement officers.

Justice Department policy explicitly prohibits law enforcement officers from discharging firearms “solely to disable moving vehicles.” Even when a “vehicle is operated in a manner that threatens to cause death or serious physical injury,” an officer may not discharge a firearm if they can reasonably avoid the harm, including by “moving out of the path of the vehicle.” Under international human rights standards, law enforcement officers can only intentionally use lethal force “when strictly unavoidable to protect life.” These standards also establish that law enforcement should ensure that injured people receive medical aid as soon as possible.

Human Rights Watch has documented other incidents of government agents’ excessive use of force against immigrants and people protesting increased raids and detentions since the Trump administration launched its violent immigration enforcement campaign last year. These abuses are compounded when law enforcement obscure their identity with face coverings, which has become a widespread practice among federal immigration enforcement agents and creates a barrier to accountability.

The Trump administration has dismantled key oversight mechanisms for DHS, including the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), which could investigate an unlawful shooting by ICE but has had its capacity decimated through drastic staffing cuts.

On January 7, the Minneapolis police chief said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), a criminal investigation agency within the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, would jointly investigate the shooting. However, the following day, BCA reported that it was closing its investigation after the FBI said it would no longer allow BCA access to evidence, and would instead lead the investigation alone.

Local and federal authorities should support one another’s efforts to thoroughly and impartially investigate Good’s killing, Human Rights Watch said. In the absence of strong internal DHS oversight mechanisms, the congressional DHS committees should hold oversight hearings.

“Good’s death is a horrifying example of the dangers posed by law enforcement agencies that have been empowered to act recklessly and sends a threatening and potentially chilling message to immigrants, protesters, and bystanders alike,” Sawyer said. “The authorities should investigate the killing publicly and thoroughly and ensure that justice is done.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2026/01/202601CCA_US_Minneapolis_ICEshooting.jpg?h=ac778ff2&itok=gCa2i5wM,N,,2026-01-09 21:57:00.470352

But the Trump administration has restructured key federal agencies in ways that leave fewer avenues for investigations that could determine whether the officer’s response was overly aggressive, legal experts said.

At the same time, there is no sign immigration raids are slowing, or that the tactics used by Homeland Security officers will change; federal officials said their efforts in Minneapolis would continue, even as tensions rise.

“We’ve been warning for weeks that the Trump administration’s dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety, that someone was going to get hurt. Just yesterday, I said exactly that,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference after the shooting this week. “What we’re seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict.”

The Department of Homeland Security has substantially cut back staff and sought to shutter three agencies, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, watchdogs that are tasked in part with investigating instances where there was a misuse of or excessive force by officers and agents. DHS officials have said the divisions were “roadblocks” to immigration enforcement operations.

A whistleblower report sent to Congress last year alleged that as a result, hundreds of complaints were left and that staffing had been cut so much that the agencies could not properly do their mandated work. Homeland Security officials have said the agencies are now just better streamlined.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which is typically involved in prosecutions of law enforcement officers accused of using excessive force, has lost hundreds of lawyers over the course of President Donald Trump’s second term in office. It dismissed lawsuits against a number of local police departments and ended investigations into patterns and practices of unconstitutional behavior, including in Minneapolis. Department officials have said the division is focusing on important administration priorities.

But questions are growing over DHS tactics as federal immigration raids have targeted communities in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Portland, Oregon. Demonstrations have shut down streets, and protests outside of detention centers have led to dozens of arrests.

Immigration officers are wearing masks that obscure their identities and have been accused of using chokeholds and pepper spray and pointing their guns at bystanders who are recording their actions. In one case, DHS officers intentionally rammed a car during a chase through a Chicago neighborhood. DHS has said the move was used to apprehend dangerous suspects, and has repeatedly defended the tactics of its officers.

There have been at least 10 shootings by immigration officers amid Homeland Security operations, including in Portland on Thursday when U.S. Border Patrol agents shot and wounded two people. At least three people have died and at least six others have been injured.

All but two involved a vehicle stop in which officers accused the driver of attempting to ram them with a car. Some drivers have faced criminal charges.

Scott Shuchart, who was ICE’s assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy during the Biden administration, said the increase in vehicle encounters represents a move away from more targeted and less risky tactics, “at great cost to collateral, property or people.”

The Trump administration has defended the DHS officers, arguing they are doing necessary and difficult work in dangerous circumstances. Homeland Security has said its immigration enforcement officers are facing increased threats and are suffering injuries during raids and operations nationwide.

But some of those narratives are being challenged by eyewitnesses, and in at least two cases, criminal charges have been dropped. In Chicago late last year, charges were dropped against a woman who had been accused of using her car to assault and impede law enforcement.

Last summer, charges were also dropped against a man in California accused of assaulting an officer with his truck during a traffic stop. His attorney, Greg Jackson, said he believes the lack of prosecutions, plus charges being filed and dropped against others accused of vehicle attacks, indicates “something is wrong” with DHS’ side of the story.

“The fact that the [Department of Justice] repeatedly is failing to get indictments in these cases shows that the initial claims by DHS are without merit,” he said.

Trump said Renee Nicole Good “viciously ran over” the officer before he shot in Minneapolis this week. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem argued Good had “weaponized” her car and that the officer had been struck and required a trip to the hospital.

Videos from the shooting show that Good did not knock down the officer, whose legs were to the side of the SUV as it moved by him while he fired. He walked away from the scene unassisted.

Cellphone footage from the ICE officer obtained by NBC News shows him before the shooting walking around Good’s Honda Pilot as she smiles at him. “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” she says. A dog is perched in the backseat.

At the same time, Ross is approached by Good’s wife, who is also filming, and asks the masked officer to show his face. She says: “You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, Big Boy.”

Two additional officers approach the SUV. One officer says to Good, “Get out of the car. Get out of the f-----g car.”

Good instead turns her steering wheel so the wheels are away from the officer and begins to drive. Shots are fired. Then a male voice says, “f-----g bitch.” A moment later, the car crashes.

A senior DHS official told NBC News that ICE is trained in best practices, including to never approach a vehicle from the front, to not shoot at a moving vehicle since firing at a vehicle would not make it stop traveling in the direction of an officer, and to only use force if there is an immediate risk of serious injury or death.

But law enforcement officers are also taught to use their own discretion during what are often chaotic moments. An investigator looking into the use of force would take all the circumstances into account, including whether the officer was under threat and whether they wrongly escalated the situation.

Geoffrey Alpert, a University of South Carolina professor who studies law enforcement tactics, said there should be at least two parallel investigations when an officer is involved in a shooting.

“One is ‘Did he commit a crime?’ and then ‘Did he violate his policies?’"" Alpert said. ""Now, ‘Did he violate his policies?’ probably has to be done by ICE because they’re the ones who are familiar with the policies and the training.”

DHS has not said whether the use of force was under investigation. The FBI had said the Minneapolis shooting was being probed and it was working closely with law enforcement partners; it’s routine for local and federal officials to work together to gather evidence in such cases. But on Thursday, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said that federal officials had reversed course and said the probe would be led solely by the FBI.

“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” the Bureau of Apprehension said.

The FBI didn’t immediately comment on the change. Noem said they hadn’t been cut out, “they don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.""

Among the key factors that are considered when evaluating whether an officer wrongly used force is whether the suspect posed a threat to the safety of a police officer or others. Multiple policing experts interviewed by NBC News said it appeared the ICE officer was in the path of the car when he fired the first shot and could therefore reasonably argue that his life was in danger.

Homeland Security’s policy says deadly force should not be used solely to prevent a person from fleeing in a moving vehicle. An officer can use deadly force toward a moving vehicle when there is a “reasonable belief that the subject poses a significant threat of death or serious physical harm” and “force is necessary to prevent escape,” according to the policy.

Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent and DHS criminal investigator, said the officer faced the threat of significant bodily harm or even death if he was struck by the vehicle.

But he also suggested that the officer used poor tactics by putting himself in front of the car, although that ultimately doesn’t matter in deciding whether it was justified.

“You can make the argument that he shouldn’t have been there,” Cangelosi said. “But he was.”

But the Trump administration has already declared publicly the shooting appeared justified. The officer involved in the shooting had been dragged roughly 100 yards by a car during an earlier enforcement operation in June, DHS said.

“All of us are on the same page in the fact that this law enforcement officer followed his training and that he defended and acted in defense of his life and those around him,” Noem told reporters the day after the shooting.

In Portland late Thursday, Border Patrol agents shot and wounded two during a car stop. Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the target was a passenger in the vehicle, described as a Venezuelan “illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring” who was involved in a recent shooting in Portland.

But the Oregon Attorney General’s Office took the unusual step of opening its own investigation to determine whether the agents used excessive force, and said it would press local charges if a crime is uncovered, a rare but not impossible move.

“It is true that federal agents have some amount of leeway — or what we in the legal world would call immunity from criminal prosecution — but there is a limit to that immunity,” said Karianne Jones, a Minneapolis-based lawyer who worked on the Biden and Harris campaigns.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-minneapolis-ice-raid-vl-447p-57d60a.jpg",N,,2026-01-09 20:57:13.387846

The statement was her first public comment about the death of Renee Good, 37, who was killed Wednesday after three Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers surrounded her Honda Pilot SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from the couple's home. Video taken by bystanders show an officer approaching the SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle.

The vehicle begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

Trump administration officials have painted Renee Good as a domestic terrorist who tried to run over an officer with her vehicle. State and local officials in Minneapolis, as well as protesters, have rejected that characterization.

Becca Good has not responded to calls and messages from The Associated Press. Her statement provided no further detail about the day of the shooting and instead focused on memorializing her wife.

The couple had only recently moved to Minneapolis and were raising Renee Good's 6-year-old son from a previous marriage.

Becca said Renee was a Christian who ""knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.""

She thanked the people all across America and the world who had reached out in support of their family.

""Renee sparkled. She literally sparkled,"" Becca Good wrote. ""I mean, she didn't wear glitter but I swear she had sparkles coming out of her pores. All the time. You might think it was just my love talking but her family said the same thing. Renee was made of sunshine.""

Far from the worst-of-the-worst criminals President Donald Trump said his immigration crackdown would target, Good was a U.S. citizen born in Colorado who apparently was never charged with anything beyond a single traffic ticket.

Becca Good said the couple, who had previously lived in Kansas City, Missouri, had settled in Minneapolis after an ""extended road trip."" She said people they encountered in the Twin Cities had provided a strong sense that ""they were looking out for each other.""

Two of the other cases that were granted – Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission – will be argued together. The court released a brief list of orders announcing those grants; it is expected to issue a longer list of orders from its Jan. 9 conference at 9:30 a.m. EST on Monday, Jan. 12.

At issue in the Cisco Systems case are the Alien Tort Statute, which allows noncitizens to bring lawsuits in federal court for serious violations of international human-rights laws, and the Torture Victim Protection Act, which allows victims of torture and extrajudicial killing to sue their overseas assailants in U.S. courts.

In the case, practitioners of the Falun Gong religion in China sued Cisco Systems, a U.S. company, and two of its executives for aiding and abetting violations of the ATS and the TVPA. The plaintiffs contend that Cisco and its executives developed and sold to the Chinese government a surveillance and internal-security system, which the Chinese government then used to find and interrogate Falun Gong practitioners.

A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allowed the lawsuit to move forward, prompting Cisco to come to the Supreme Court seeking review. It argued (among other things) that neither law allows private plaintiffs to bring claims for aiding and abetting violations. In a brief filed in December at the Supreme Court’s invitation, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to weigh in on those questions.

While government officials have claimed that she was shot in self-defense while attempting to run over the agent, video footage clearly demonstrates that this is simply not true. Her tragic killing was unnecessary and unjustified.

Although this horrific incident took place in Minnesota, it represents a problem that touches communities throughout the nation. The current Administration has continued to expand the size and authority of ICE. WSNA has gone on record opposing the assault on immigrant rights, in which ICE has played a leading role. The 2025 WSNA General Assembly adopted a motion declaring our “support for the rights and fair treatment of immigrants to the United States,” and calling for an end to ICE raids in health care settings, places of worship, and all public spaces. WSNA has also provided advice to nurses about what to do if ICE agents come to their workplace.

Aggressive policies purportedly aimed at undocumented immigrants have affected a wide range of immigrants regardless of legal status. The Administration has even threatened to denaturalize and deport naturalized citizens. But with the killing of Renee Good, it is clearer than ever that anyone can be at risk for protesting ICE presence in our communities.

WSNA has joined with community organizations in decrying dangerous conditions in ICE detention facilities, including neglect of health care needs that has led to injury and even death. We have opposed ICE presence in hospitals, whether through raids or in accompanying detainees. Such presence not only has a chilling effect on immigrants seeking healthcare services; it poses dangers to patients, staff, and visitors. It was only last October when an ICE contractor left a loaded gun in a bathroom at St. Joseph Tacoma.

We also note that, after Renee Good was shot, agents not only failed to render first aid, but they also actively prevented a physician on the scene from attending to her. This is unconscionable. Health professionals must be allowed to provide care for injured people—to act under the protection of Good Samaritan laws.

Nurses care daily for victims of violence. Our hearts go out to Renee Good’s family, friends, and neighbors, who must deal now with the trauma of witnessing her brutal killing.

Why it matters: The killing and a subsequent Border Patrol shooting in Portland have sparked outrage and anger at the Trump administration, which has defended its agents.

Driving the news: There have been at least seven officer-involved shootings since President Trump ramped up Homeland Security operations in early 2025.

On Wednesday, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis as she drove past immigration agents. The Trump administration claimed the shooting was an act of self-defense as Good drove away, but Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has rejected that claim.

On Thursday, two people were shot by Border Patrol agents in Portland during what officials said was ""a targeted vehicle stop."" Both were hospitalized.

State of play: Protests, vigils and other ""ICE Out For Good"" events are being held by groups including Indivisible, 50501, the Disappeared in America Campaign, Voto Latino and the American Civil Liberties Union. The mobilization is meant to humanize ICE victims and demand accountability.

""Good and the Portland victims are part of a broader and deeply alarming pattern of unchecked violence and abuse by federal immigration enforcement agencies,"" organizers said in a statement.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Axios that protesters should remember ""interfering with federal law enforcement officers is a crime.""

""Those committing crimes will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

By the numbers: 580 events were scheduled across the country as of Friday evening.

More than 1,000 are ultimately anticipated, organizers said.

Mayor Frey responded to Wednesday's shooting emphatically, telling ICE to ""get the f---"" out of his city. In a Thursday New York Times op-ed, he said the killing was ""sadly predictable"" because of the Trump administration's harsh immigration actions.

Flashback: Anti-ICE demonstrations spread across the U.S. in June in response to federal immigration sweeps in Los Angeles.

In September in Chicago, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-González during a traffic stop. The agency said he was resisting arrest.

DHS Expands Minneapolis Enforcement as Mayor Demands ICE Withdrawal Following Fatal Shooting

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deployed approximately 2,000 officers and agents to Minneapolis in what DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called “the largest immigration operation ever,” combining immigration enforcement with a Justice Department fraud investigation targeting Minnesota programs. The Trump administration also announced on January 8 that it is creating a new division within the Department of Justice for national fraud enforcement to lead investigations into what it characterizes as “Minnesota’s fraud epidemic”. On January 7, an ICE Special Response Team officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good, a U.S. citizen and legal observer, on January 8 in south Minneapolis after she had dropped her child at school, triggering widespread protests.

The fatal shooting has intensified tensions between federal and state authorities, with Governor Tim Walz authorizing the Minnesota National Guard to stand ready and declaring a “Day of Unity” in Good’s honor. Secretary Noem characterized Good’s actions as “an act of domestic terrorism,” while President Trump claimed she “ran over” an officer, though videos posted to social media do not corroborate those accounts. Federal agents also deployed pepper spray at Roosevelt High School grounds during an immigration enforcement operation and used chemical irritants against protesters outside the Whipple Federal Building, where hundreds gathered to demand ICE withdrawal from Minnesota.

Federal

Venezuelans in the U.S. Face Uncertainty Following Maduro’s Arrest

Venezuelan immigrants in the United States face uncertainty after the arrest of former President Nicolás Maduro on drug trafficking charges, as the Trump administration maintains that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans ended last year. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem suggested Venezuelans could apply for refugee status but the agency later clarified that applicants generally must be outside the United States to qualify, directing those without lawful status to departure and reentry options instead of offering new protections. Asylum applications from Venezuelans also remain stalled under current policy suspending processing for a total of 39 countries, after 20 additional countries were added in December.

At the same time, the Justice Department is using Maduro’s arrest to defend the administration’s reliance on the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport certain Venezuelan nationals, including people accused of ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. On December 22, 2025, a federal judge ordered the administration to offer some form of relief to men previously deported under the AEA, and further litigation will determine whether the government can continue using the law as a basis for Venezuelan deportations. In court filings, government lawyers told the judge that Maduro’s arrest created “substantial changes on the ground in Venezuela” requiring additional time to evaluate potential remedies for men previously deported under the AEA.

DHS Moves to Finalize Weighted H‑1B Cap Selection Rule

On December 22, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted a final rule replacing the random H-1B visa lottery with a weighted selection system to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under the final rule, which takes effect on February 27 and will apply to the fiscal year 2027 registration season beginning in March 2026, applicants at the highest wage level will receive four entries in the lottery pool while those at the lowest level receive one entry. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) stated the change aims to “better protect the wages, working conditions, and job opportunities for American workers” by addressing what the agency described as employer abuse of the previous system to hire foreign workers at lower wages.

The weighted system assigns entries based on the Department of Labor’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, which provides four wage levels corresponding to experience and job complexity within each occupation and geographic region. The rule does not affect existing cap exemptions for higher education institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and government research organizations, which can continue filing H-1B petitions outside the lottery system year-round.

ICE More Than Doubles Workforce in 2025, Plans $100 Million Recruitment Push

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) more than doubled its workforce in 2025, growing from 10,000 officers and agents when President Trump took office to over 22,000 by the end of the year. The agency achieved the increase in just four months after Congress allocated $8 billion for ICE through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sorting through more than 220,000 applications and offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 and expanded student loan repayments. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shortened training from six months to approximately six weeks to accelerate deployment, while the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center curtailed operations for non-ICE personnel to prioritize the agency’s recruits.

ICE is also planning a $100 million “wartime recruitment” media campaign in 2026 to continue expanding its deportation force, according to internal documents. The strategy uses geofencing technology to deliver recruitment ads to mobile devices of people near military bases, gun shows, NASCAR races, UFC fights, and college campuses, while targeting audiences interested in firearms, tactical gear, patriotic podcasts, and fitness content. Current recruitment materials frame immigration as an existential threat, with ICE’s hiring website stating “America has been invaded by criminals and predators” and calling for Americans to join what it describes as a “sacred duty ” to defend the nation.

Supreme Court Decision Forces Trump to Back Away from National Guard Deployments in Three Cities

The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s request to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago on December 23, 2025, ruling that the government failed to identify proper legal authority to use military forces to execute laws in Illinois. In a three-page unsigned order, the justices found that the statutory term “regular forces” likely refers to the U.S. military rather than civilian law enforcement, meaning the president must demonstrate inability to execute laws with regular military forces before federalizing the National Guard. The decision upheld lower court rulings that found insufficient evidence that protest activity in Illinois significantly impeded federal officers’ ability to execute immigration laws, or that demonstrations constituted a danger of rebellion against government authority.

Following the Supreme Court’s ruling, the administration withdrew its plans to deploy National Guard troops not only in Chicago but also in Los Angeles and Portland, where a federal judge had separately issued a permanent injunction blocking such deployments. The administration had relied on a federal law allowing the president to federalize the National Guard when unable to execute U.S. laws with regular forces or when facing invasion, rebellion, or danger of rebellion, deploying 300 Guard members to Chicago in early October to assist with immigration enforcement operations.

Federal Judge Blocks TPS Termination for Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua

A federal district court ruled on December 31, 2025 that the Trump administration unlawfully terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua, finding that Secretary Kristi Noem made a “pre-ordained decision” to end the programs before conducting the required review of country conditions. In a 52-page summary judgment, the court concluded that Noem “influenced the conditions review process to facilitate TPS terminations” rather than basing her decision on an objective assessment as required by the TPS statute and the Administrative Procedure Act. The TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were established in the late 1990s following Hurricane Mitch, while Nepal’s designation was created in 2015 after a deadly earthquake.

The ruling restores work authorization and deportation protections for the affected TPS holders, many of whom have lived in the United States for more than two decades. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, arguing that TPS “was never designed to be permanent” and that conditions in the three countries have improved sufficiently to end the designations. Separately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., is currently weighing whether to block TPS termination for approximately 350,000 Haitians, with a decision expected by February 2, one day before Haiti’s TPS designation expires. The court expressed skepticism during a January 6 hearing about whether DHS adequately evaluated conditions in Haiti, where gangs control much of the capital following the 2021 assassination of the country’s last democratically elected president.

Judge Permits ICE to Access Limited Medicaid Data for Immigration Enforcement

A federal court ruled on December 29, 2025 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may share limited Medicaid enrollment information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation purposes, partially lifting a preliminary injunction that had blocked data transfers since August. The ruling permits HHS to provide six categories of basic information about individuals unlawfully present in the United States, including citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID, but prohibits sharing personal health records or medical information. The court found that federal statutes clearly authorize interagency cooperation for law enforcement purposes, including immigration enforcement, and that sharing basic biographical and location data complies with privacy laws.

The decision is a setback for California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other Democratic attorneys general who sued the Trump administration in July, arguing that data sharing would deter immigrants from seeking medical care and violate health privacy protections. Undocumented immigrants are generally ineligible for federal Medicaid, but California and several other states—including Illinois, Colorado, New York, Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota—allow some individuals to receive state-funded benefits through their Medicaid programs regardless of immigration status. The ruling has created urgency for undocumented Californians to enroll in Medi-Cal before January 2027, when the state will freeze eligibility for unauthorized immigrants, though community health workers report that fears over data sharing and the proposed public charge rule are causing some to forgo enrollment despite their need for prenatal care, prescription medications, and other services.

In Portland, DHS said the agents were attempting to stop an unauthorized immigrant from Venezuela affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang.
The Portland FBI issued an initial post Thursday on X characterizing the incident as an officer-involved shooting.
“This is highly problematic and not a good look and not something our government should be remotely engaged in,” the administration official said of the Minneapolis shooting.
You have a woman who was trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement officer.","“Do I think it’s domestic terrorism? Yeah, I do,” said a person close to the White House, who, like others in the story, was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the sensitive situation and ongoing investigation. “But it might not have been wise to say that at the outset, how [Noem] said it.”

Within 48 hours, another shooting, this time in Portland, Oregon, by a Customs and Border Protection officer, further inflamed outrage as protesters, Democrats and top administration officials accused each other of fascism and terrorism.

The shootings — and the eye witness videos circulating on the internet — come amid heightened tensions between Americans and the thousands of federal agents deployed in U.S. cities. Vice President JD Vance on Thursday lamented the threats and attacks ICE agents are under. On Friday, he shared a new video that he implied vindicated the officer in Minnesota by showing his “life was endangered and he fired in self defense.”

Still, the administration’s aggressive tactics, aimed at ramping up arrests and deportations, have brought widespread condemnation and a growing number of confrontations between protesters and immigration officials, who are deployed for crowd control and other tasks the agencies historically don’t perform.

It has left ICE as the latest and most prominent example of an ongoing national Rorschach test in which Republicans and Democrats watch the same video and claim to see wildly different truths, and some inside the agency worry that the administration’s rhetoric will only widen political fractures.

“I don’t know how we recover from this,” said an administration official.

In Portland, DHS said the agents were attempting to stop an unauthorized immigrant from Venezuela affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang. Portland police said officers responded to the scene and treated a man and a woman with gunshot wounds, both of whom remain hospitalized.

The Portland FBI issued an initial post Thursday on X characterizing the incident as an officer-involved shooting. It was later deleted. When POLITICO requested the statement from Portland FBI Thursday evening, it characterized it as an “assault on federal officers.”

The incident in Portland appeared to be a targeted operation, but Democrats tied it to the shooting in Minneapolis as another example of the Trump administration rushing to close a case prior to an investigation. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Friday that the administration “can’t be trusted,” citing a separate case in Chicago from last year.

“This pattern of ‘shoot first, then lie, lie, deny’ has to stop,” she said. “The videos don’t lie.”

The administration official was more sympathetic to the Portland agents because it was a targeted operation, but the official added that it will be difficult for the average American to separate the two closely-timed incidents.

“This is highly problematic and not a good look and not something our government should be remotely engaged in,” the administration official said of the Minneapolis shooting.

When asked about concerns that the administration’s approach could undermine public confidence in its investigation, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin also pointed POLITICO to the new footage shared by Vance and other administration officials. She added: “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer, that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such.”

Minnesota officials have accused federal law enforcement of stymying state investigators into the deadly ICE-related shooting, which came as more than 2,000 agents descended on Minnesota this week in the Trump administration’s largest immigration operation to date. As for Oregon, state officials have opened a separate investigation.

Officers were deployed to the North Star State from across the country, as part of the administration’s efforts to crackdown on the welfare-fraud scandal in the state.

Just hours after the shooting in Minneapolis, DHS declared on X that the woman’s actions were an act of “domestic terrorism.” Noem gave live remarks soon after echoing this conclusion. White House officials argued the same, all before an investigation had really begun.

“Whatever outcome this investigation produces, I don’t see how anyone’s gonna believe it when the secretary already is firmly — and doubled down on — a conclusion without knowing all the facts,” said John Sandweg, who led ICE from 2013 to 2014 under the Obama administration.

Border czar Tom Homan’s response was initially more measured, telling CBS News that he wouldn’t comment on an ongoing investigation. He released a statement later on Wednesday, saying the “brave women and men of ICE are heroes. Like all Americans, our officers have a right to self defense. Full stop.”

“Homan had a very mature response, and a thoughtful, professional way of dealing with it,” said the person close to the White House. “I think you can read a lot into that.”

The White House on Thursday added a press briefing to the schedule, with Vance at the podium for more than 30 minutes fielding questions from reporters. Vance said, without offering evidence, that the woman shot and killed in Minnesota was influenced by a leftist network. Reporters pushed him on whether there was a risk in defining the victim in the early stages of the investigation. He said the Department of Justice, in addition to the investigation DHS is conducting, will continue to look into the incident.

“But the simple fact is what you see is what you get in this case. You have a woman who was trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement officer. Nobody debates that. I can believe that her death is a tragedy, while also recognizing that it’s a tragedy of her own making and a tragedy of a far-left who has martialed an entire movement of lunatic fringe against our law enforcement officers.”

Trump on Friday was asked during his meeting with oil executives about what he’s learned about the “left wing network” Vance referred to. The president said he had not seen the vice president’s remarks, but he referenced a woman screaming “shame” in one of the videos circulating online and called her a “professional troublemaker.”

“You have agitators, and we will always be protecting ICE and we will always be protecting our Border Patrol and our law enforcement,” the president told reporters.

Court filings show that the officer who shot Good, Jonathan Ross, had been injured in June when he was dragged by a different vehicle in Minnesota. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday that the officer had “abrasions all over his body” from the operation targeting an unauthorized immigrant convicted of felony sexual assault on a minor and suggested that it helps explains why Ross was likely on hyper-alert when Good began driving.

But some former and current officials who have worked in immigration enforcement — while they note many facts remain unknown — were alarmed by the footage and the agent’s decision to fire his weapon. And Sandweg, the former ICE leader, fears that the administration’s response will only create more challenges for law enforcement officers who are already being placed in “tough” situations they aren’t trained for.

“You’re not doing the agency or the agents any justice when you rush out and reflexively defend them. You just create risks of more of this,” he said. “No one at ICE goes to work saying ‘I want to shoot someone,’ absolutely not. But the aggression is being rewarded, and I think sometimes you’re better off to just stop and think a little bit.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd9%2F1d%2F4169dec6467bbd46b938cdfbde7d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2255109761,N,,2026-01-09 18:57:34.387229

Speaking on a Jan. 7 FOX NEWS broadcast, Vice President JD Vance said ICE would be going ""door to door"" in the coming months as agents carry out President Donald Trump's plans for the largest mass deportation in history. Federal officials say they've now got about 22,000 agents and investigators, up from 10,000 a year ago.

Without providing specific details, White House officials say 2.5 million people living illegally in the United States have already been deported or left under pressure, and promise far more will be leaving one way or another. Vance's comments were broadcast hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis shot and killed a woman inside her car during a chaotic confrontation.

White House officials have accused Democrats of encouraging illegal immigration to reshape the country's voting patterns.

Vance said the more aggressive enforcement that began in 2025 will ramp up this year. ""All of the big investments that we've made in border security, what we've done is actually gotten 2.5 million illegal aliens out without any of the really big marquee things we've been working on,"" Vance said.

""I think we're going to see those deportation numbers ramp up as we get more and more people online working for ICE, going door to door, making sure if you're an illegal alien you've got to get out of this country and if you want to come back, apply through the proper channels,"" he said.

Administration plans many more actions

Among the new, more aggressive moves underway:

In November, federal officials announced they were planning to hire thousands of private ""skip tracers"" to conduct both online and in-person verification of the home and work addresses of up to 1.5 million people living in the United States. The contractors would be given batches of 50,000 names at a time, and are expected to provide photos of homes and workplaces, according to federal contracting data. They would also be required to gather utility bills, court records and employment verification information without telling anyone why they're collecting it.

Immigration officials are exploring whether they can buy and convert large warehouses into detention and processing ""megacenters."" Buying the warehouses of the type often used by Amazon and other online retailers could allow federal officials to exempt themselves from many local zoning restrictions and oversight rules governing private or state-run prisons and jails. ICE detention teams have been hampered in Democrat-run cities and states where local jails don't assist with immigration detention, and adding the new capacity could allow much larger operations in those communities.

A Virginia-based company is building a 5,000-bed temporary immigration detention center on Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, near the southern border under a $232 million contract, according to the Department of Defense. Federal officials have said they want to add at least 60,000 detention beds to the approximately 41,000 beds they had this time last year.

Last summer's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" signed by President Donald Trump on July 4 provides $170 billion in immigration and border-related funding, all of which must be spent within about four years. Included in that funding is pay and benefits for 10,000 new ICE agents and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents. (It's not clear whether those jobs are in addition to the 12,000 already added.)

Opinions differ by party

When Trump took office, after winning the popular vote, estimates put the number of people living here illegally at anywhere between 10 million and 16.8 million.

Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that Trump has largely followed in his second term, specifically called for deploying ICE deportation agents ""anywhere"" in the country to enforce immigration laws - not just along the nation's borders.

""The patriotic men and women of (ICE) are doing God's work to protect this country,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media Jan. 5.

But many Americans think the enforcement has already gone too far.

An October Pew Research Center survey found that 53% of Americans say the Trump administration is doing ""too much"" when it comes to deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally, up from 44% in March. Opinions were starkly divided by party, with 86% of Democrats or those who lean Democratic saying the administration is going too far, compared with just 20% of Republicans and Republican leaners.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other critics of Trump's enforcement efforts liken ICE tactics to those used by Hitler's Gestapo, and say immigration agents are routinely trampling the rights and norms Americans are accustomed to as they sweep through frightened communities.

While Trump promised to go after immigrants without legal status who are ""the worst of the worst,"" according to an analysis of ICE statistics by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, nearly 75% of the approximately 60,000 people in immigration detention as of November had no criminal convictions.

In a Jan. 8 statement, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the lead Democrat on the Republican-controlled House Homeland Security Committee, called for Noem to testify before Congress on both the Minneapolis shooting and overall immigration tactics.

""The Trump administration’s out-of-control and unconstitutional invasion of our communities must be stopped before another American is injured or killed at the hands of their own government,"" the Mississippi Democrat said. ""Republicans who continue to sit idly by as the Trump administration violates our communities and hurts Americans are as culpable as President Trump himself for the harm he is causing our great country.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PTX1/87657211007-john-ice-4309.JPG?crop=3499,1968,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-09 18:57:37.607348

Donna Ganger, her mother, told the Minnesota Star Tribune the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Before Renee Good was fatally shot behind the wheel of her vehicle by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, the 37-year-old mother of three dropped off her youngest child at an elementary school in Minneapolis, the newest city she called home.

While Trump administration officials continued Thursday to paint Good as a domestic terrorist who attempted to ram federal agents with her Honda Pilot, members of her family, friends and neighbors mourned a woman they remembered as gentle, kind and openhearted.

Good, her 6-year-old son and her wife only recently relocated to Minneapolis from Kansas City, Missouri. The family settled on a quiet residential street of older homes and multifamily buildings, some front porches festooned with pride flags still twinkling with holiday lights. A day after her death, neighbors had grown weary of talking to reporters. A handwritten sign posted to one front door read “NO MEDIA INQUIRES” and “JUSTICE FOR RENEE.”

Far from the worst-of-the-worst criminals President Donald Trump said his immigration crackdown would target, Good was a U.S. citizen born in Colorado who apparently was never charged with anything beyond a single traffic ticket.

In social media accounts, she described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom.” She said she was currently “experiencing Minneapolis,” displaying a pride emoji on her Instagram account. A profile picture posted to Pinterest shows her smiling and holding a young child against her cheek, along with posts about tattoos, hairstyles and home decorating.

Her ex-husband, who asked not to be named out of concern for the safety of their children, said Good was no activist and he never knew her to participate in a protest of any kind. He said she was headed home before the encounter with a group of ICE agents on a snowy street.

State and local officials and protesters have rejected the Trump administration’s characterization of the shooting, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying video recordings show the self-defense argument is “garbage.”

Video taken by bystanders posted to social media shows an officer approaching her car, demanding she open the door and grabbing the handle. When she begins to pull forward, a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range.

The entire incident was over in less than 10 seconds.

In another video taken immediately after the shooting, a distraught woman is seen sitting near the vehicle, wailing, “That’s my wife, I don’t know what to do!”

Calls and messages to Good’s wife received no response.

On Thursday a few dozen people gathered on the one-way street where Good was killed, blocking the road with steel drums filled with burning wood for warmth to ward of a pelting freezing rain. Passersby stopped to pay their respects at a makeshift memorial with bouquets of flowers and a hand-fashioned cross.

Good’s ex-husband said she was a devoted Christian who took part in youth mission trips to Northern Ireland when she was younger. She loved to sing, participating in a chorus in high school and studying vocal performance in college.

She studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia and won a prize in 2020 for one of her works, according to a post on the school’s English department Facebook page. She also hosted a podcast with her second husband, who died in 2023.

Kent Wascom, who taught Good in the creative writing program at Old Dominion, recalled her juggling the birth of her child with work and school in 2019. He described her as “incredibly caring of her peers.”

“What stood out to me in her prose was that, unlike a lot of young fiction writers, her focus was outward rather than inward,” Wascom said. “A creative writing workshop can be a gnarly place with a lot of egos and competition, but her presence was something that helped make that classroom a really supportive place.”

Good had a daughter and a son from her first marriage, who are now 15 and 12. Her 6-year-old son was from her second marriage.

Her ex-husband said she was primarily a stay-at-home mom in recent years but previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union.

Donna Ganger, her mother, told the Minnesota Star Tribune the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning. She did not respond to calls or messages from the AP.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” Ganger told the newspaper. “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

The video of the deadly shooting of Good, a 37-year-old mother, in a Minneapolis neighborhood by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, was scrutinized by thousands of journalists and millions of Americans and made headlines around the globe.

But in the United States, the shooting was seen through a political lens, provoking an emotional response in Congress that has led to a sharp increase in partisan enmity and even a few confrontations.

Republicans, including those in Minnesota’s congressional delegation, praised the work of ICE and some, including those representing the state, blamed the shooting on “hateful” and “dangerous” speech by Democratic politicians who condemn the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Democrats, meanwhile, echoed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s demand that ICE leave the Twin Cities.

“President Trump, Secretary Noem, hear me loud and clear: ICE must leave Minnesota – NOW,” Rep. Angie Craig, D-2nd District, said in a statement.

The sharp divide has resulted in some clashes.

On Wednesday, the day Good was killed, Craig approached Rep. Tom Emmer, R-6th District, on the House floor. According to a source close to the congresswoman, Craig accused Emmer of “political stunts” in defending ICE operations and discuss Emmer’s reaction to Good’s shooting.

During a Wednesday hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Emmer said Minnesota Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz; Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar; Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-5th District; and Craig had done nothing about the fraud.

After ICE shooting, partisan responses

And after Good’s shooting, Emmer was quick to put out a statement that said: “Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals.”

“May God bless and protect them in their efforts,” Emmer said. “Shame on the elected officials who endanger these agents by spewing lies and hateful rhetoric.”

There was lots of shouting and finger pointing during Craig’s confrontation with Emmer, attracting the attention of a couple of members of the House Sergeant of Arms office, which is tasked with keeping decorum on the House floor. That’s when Rep. Betty McCollum, D-4th District, stepped in to break things up.

Meanwhile, House Homeland Security Committee Democrats are demanding that the panel’s Republican majority call Noem – who was in Minneapolis the evening of the shooting – to testify about the shooting. Noem said it was the result of “domestic terrorism” and that the shooter, now identified as ICE agent Jonathan Ross, was in fear for his life.

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the committee, sent the chairman of the panel, Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., a letter on Thursday demanding a hearing.

Related: Yes, state and local prosecutors can charge federal law enforcement agents with crimes. But it isn’t easy

“Contrary to Secretary Noem’s press statements, there has been no evidence shared that would justify Ms. Good’s killing,” Thompson’s letter said. “The perpetrator must be held accountable, and Secretary Noem must answer for this shooting as well as other recent acts of violence by her officers and agents.”

Garbarino responded that “the FBI is actively investigating Wednesday’s shooting, and the results of that investigation will be reviewed by this committee,” and did not agree to a hearing that would grill Noem about Good’s shooting.

Meanwhile, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., said Thursday that she plans to file articles of impeachment against Noem. While it’s doubtful there will be such an inquiry in the GOP-controlled House, things could change if Democrats win back control of the House in November.

More ICE shootings

According to the New York Times, Good’s shooting was at least the ninth immigration-enforcement related shooting since September. And all shooting victims were targeted while in their vehicles.

Then two shootings happened Thursday in Portland, Oregon, when a Border Patrol agent shot a man and woman – also in a car. Echoing what she said about the Good shooting, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agent “fired defensive shots” after the driver of the car tried to run the agents over.

Another incident that roiled congressional Democrats – and DFLers in the state – was the apparent reversal of Homeland Security to coordinate with the state on an investigation of the shooting. The department said the FBI would go it alone.

On X Thursday, Frey said Noem “doesn’t want an impartial investigation because she knows her narrative about domestic terrorism is bullshit.”

And during a press conference on Thursday, Walz also blasted the decision to cut Minnesota law enforcement from the investigation.

“I want to make this as clear as possible to everyone. Minnesota must be a part of this,” Walz said. “I think it’s clear to everyone … that it feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation. It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is weighing a run for governor after Walz announced Monday that he will not seek re-election, also weighed in.

“The FBI must work with the professionals at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation of the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer yesterday,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “This has to be about justice, not politics.”

Senate votes to limit Trump’s war powers

With the help of five Republicans, the Senate on Thursday advanced a bill that would curb President Donald Trump’s warfighting authority.

The 52-47 vote was the first time Congress has tried to restrain Trump’s use of military power. Two similar resolutions – considered by the U.S. House before U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife and before Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela – were defeated.

Most Republicans support Trump’s plans on Venezuela, which includes transferring the vast reserves of that nation’s oil to U.S. oil companies. But there are concerns about escalating threats to use force against other nations, including Denmark, which has control of Greenland.

Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith voted with all Democrats for the resolution. So did Republican Sens. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Trump reacted angrily to the defections, attacking the five Republican lawmakers by name in a post on Truth Social and saying they should never be elected to office again.

A reader reacted to President Donald Trump’s reposting of a video on Truth Social of someone falsely insinuating that Gov. Tim Walz was involved in the assassination of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband and to other controversies sparked by the Trump administration.

“Trump blaming Walz for the Hortman assassination shows how vicious he is,” the reader wrote. “That media stories are not mentioning this as part of the reason Walz dropped out is disappointing. Trump’s lies about Somalis being responsible for most crime that are echoed by Emmer are disturbing. What next? Deporting US citizens? Concentration camps? These attacks on Minnesota and Trump’s other perceived enemies like [Sen.] Mark Kelly should not go unchallenged.”

Investigations in Minneapolis and Portland are ongoing, and in both instances, the FBI is in charge of investigating the shootings by federal agents.","State and local prosecutors in Minnesota are moving to collect and preserve evidence about an ICE agent's killing of Renee Good, working independently of the FBI. It's the latest sign of friction between the Trump administration and local officials over federal agents' use of lethal force in two separate shootings this week.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said the initiative, announced Friday, is a response to federal authorities' decision to exclude state investigators from the FBI's investigation into the fatal shooting of Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Moriarty said she wants the government to reconsider that decision.

""Our efforts in advocating for a joint investigation is not an attack on the FBI,"" Moriarty said during a news conference. ""We have had a strong working relationship with the local FBI field office throughout my administration.""

With the FBI acting as the sole lead agency for the inquiry, she added, state and local authorities would be blocked from viewing the bureau's findings. They would also not have access to critical evidence, such as Good's car, any shell casings, and witness interviews.

Moriarty said her office is working with the state attorney general's office to gather evidence and ensure a transparent investigation. They issued a call for Minneapolis residents to submit evidence online.

Officials in Oregon are also calling for a transparent inquiry into a second high-profile shooting this week involving federal agents, after Customs and Border Patrol agents shot and injured two people in Portland on Thursday. As in the Minneapolis case, federal officials say the agents fired in self-defense, in line with their training.

""We know what the federal government says happened here,"" Portland Mayor Wilson said of Thursday's shooting. ""There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past. That is why we are calling on ICE to halt all operations in Portland until a full and independent investigation can take place.""

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek echoed Wilson's call for answers, saying on X that a full and thorough investigation, not more detentions, should be the government's main priority.

Along with the rift between local and federal officials, reactions to the shootings, from public protests to online arguments, reflect a deep divide in how they're seen — as tragic abuses of power or law enforcement officers acting in self-defense.

Portland: Border Patrol shoot and wound 2 people

Shortly after 2:15 p.m. local time, a man and a woman were shot by federal agents in the Hazelwood neighborhood, according to the Portland Police Bureau. FBI Portland told member station OPB that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were involved.

Less than 10 minutes later, Portland officers responded to a call several miles away from a man who had been shot and was requesting help, Portland Chief of Police Bob Day said in a news conference.

""We found a male and a female with apparent gunshot wounds,"" Day said. ""Officers applied a tourniquet and summoned emergency medical personnel.""

The pair were taken to a local hospital and officers determined that they were wounded in the shooting involving federal agents, Day said. Details about their conditions have not emerged.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the shooting occurred while Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop. After agents identified themselves, McLaughlin alleged, the driver ""weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents.""

""Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,"" she said in a statement, adding that the driver fled the scene in the car.

McLaughlin said the driver and passenger were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua but did not offer evidence of their gang association.

On Friday, Homeland Security identified the driver of the vehicle as Luis David Nico Moncada, and the passenger as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, both from Venezuela.

Just hours after issuing a message of solidarity to Minneapolis, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson convened a news conference about a shooting by federal officers in his own city. Wilson said he spoke to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Thursday about what he called the ""recklessness"" of federal actions under President Trump.

Like Frey, Wilson called for a halt to the ""surge"" of federal agents targeting cities such as Minneapolis and Portland.

""We know what the federal government says happened here,"" Wilson said of Thursday's shooting. ""There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past. That is why we are calling on ICE to hold all operations in Portland until a full and independent investigation can take place.""

Minneapolis: ICE agent in shooting is identified

Good died after being shot in her Honda Pilot SUV on Wednesday morning, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.

ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters. A witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders about either getting out of the vehicle or driving away.

(Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)

Video footage from the scene shows Good's SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. As officers approach, the SUV moves forward — and an ICE agent who was near the front of the vehicle, later identified as Ross, opens fire at close range. The SUV then crashes into a nearby telephone pole.

NPR identified the ICE agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Good as Jonathan Ross by cross-referencing court records with details about the officer released by Noem at a Wednesday news conference. Noem — without naming the officer — spoke about a previous confrontation he had with a motorist.

""The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and [dragged] him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time, as well,"" she said.

The description of the incident matches a court case against a Mexican national, Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala, who was found guilty in December of assaulting a federal officer in Bloomington, Minn. DHS confirmed to NPR that the court case is the one Noem referenced. Ross' name is mentioned in court documents for the case. According to the legal records, federal officers initiated a traffic stop of Munoz-Guatemala, who had been convicted of sexual abuse, in an attempt to arrest him. Munoz-Guatemala sped away after Ross had reached inside the vehicle, trapping the agent's arm and causing him to sustain injuries to his arm and hand.

Noem said that Wednesday's shooting occurred after protesters in Minneapolis harassed and impeded ICE agents and that the officer acted to protect himself and fellow officers. She alleged that Good's actions amounted to ""an act of domestic terrorism.""

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR's Morning Edition that he disagrees with Noem's characterization of Good as a domestic terrorist.

""She was a compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors,"" Ellison said. ""That's what she was doing at the moment of her death. And she was a poet. She was a mom. She was a daughter. And I am deeply saddened by what happened to her and her family.""

Good's wife, Becca Good, said in a statement to MPR that when the shooting took place, the couple was attempting to support their neighbors.

""Renee leaves behind three extraordinary children; the youngest is just six years old and already lost his father,"" Becca Good said. ""I am now left to raise our son and to continue teaching him, as Renee believed, that there are people building a better world for him.""

Competing narratives quickly emerge

Minneapolis Mayor Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, ""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. ""

""This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,"" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.

Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.

""It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,"" she said, as NPR reported. ""Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.""

When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released ""and is spending time with his family now.""

She also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.

""We've got thousands of officers there,"" she said, ""and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.""

What's next?

Investigations in Minneapolis and Portland are ongoing, and in both instances, the FBI is in charge of investigating the shootings by federal agents.

In Portland, Day, the police chief, said that local police have been helping to secure scenes related to Thursday's shooting, but that's the extent of their involvement. ""This is a federal investigation. It's being led by the FBI,"" he said.

In Minnesota, O'Hara initially said on Wednesday that the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.

But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it ""has reluctantly withdrawn"" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.

A day later, prosecutors in Minnesota unveiled their plan to pursue their own investigation of the case.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x4608+0+429/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2F8a%2F166c20c748d598bf512392a6dad9%2Fgettyimages-2254812845.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:58:01.139859

Lt. Mark Chance of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 68 of the 993 inmates now housed at the Polk County Jail are detainees of DHS or ICE.

According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail.","Polk County is facing more lawsuits brought by individuals detained in the county jail by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Polk, Woodbury, Muscatine and other Iowa counties have been sued by numerous jail inmates in recent months, each alleging they’ve been unlawfully detained in county jails by ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

An exact count of all the lawsuits against Iowa jails is difficult to calculate given the fact that Iowa’s county jails typically don’t disclose the names of inmates who are being held at the direction of ICE. In addition, public access to the federal court records related to those detentions is tightly restricted.

However, the available records show Polk County, ICE and DHS are named as defendants in at least three additional cases recently filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.

Lt. Mark Chance of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 68 of the 993 inmates now housed at the Polk County Jail are detainees of DHS or ICE.

Nationally and in Iowa, many of the lawsuits surrounding ICE detainees involve the Trump administration’s six-month-old effort to expand its “mandatory detention” policy. Under that policy, ICE is holding people in jail indefinitely as their immigration cases proceed, while arguing those individuals are not entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release on bond.

Politico recently reported that more than 300 federal judges, including appointees of every president since Ronald Reagan, have rejected the administration’s “mandatory detention” theory in more than 1,600 cases.

The courts’ near-universal rejection of the administration’s position has not prevented the U.S. Department of Justice from continuing to use that rationale to jail people indefinitely. In fact, the DOJ recently appealed one judge’s ruling against ICE after it resulted in a woman’s release from the Muscatine County Jail.

Polk County man detained during traffic stop

One of the newly filed cases involves Ulises Ramirez Cruz, who sued Polk County and ICE over his detention and the refusal of the immigration courts to provide him with a hearing at which he could argue for his release on bond.

Court records indicate Ramirez Cruz has lived in Iowa for five years. He alleges that ICE agents — identified in court records only as T. Staudinger, Scroggins, Palmer and Hanson — waited outside his house on Nov. 7, 2025, and then pulled him over after he left the house, got into his car and drove away.

U.S. Attorney David Waterman argued in court that Ramirez Cruz is not entitled to a bond hearing and is subject to mandatory detention. In a recent ruling against the government, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher noted he has rejected the DOJ’s arguments in at least three other cases that have come before him, and that judges around the country have “overwhelmingly” issued similar decisions.

Locher’s order directs the immigration court to provide Ramirez Cruz with an opportunity to argue for his release on bond while the underlying immigration case proceeds.

‘Punitive detention’ alleged in Polk County case

The second recent case involves a Polk County Jail inmate, Luis Pedroso, a citizen of Cuba who has been in the United States for four and a half years. Pedroso has applied for status as a legal permanent resident of the United States, but as part of the approval process, he must prove he’s not ineligible on public-health grounds, which would involve a physical examination to rule out drug abuse and communicable diseases.

Under federal regulations, that examination must be provided by a physician selected by or approved by immigration authorities. Attorneys for Pedroso argue that the jail, Polk County Health Department and ICE are all unwilling or unable to provide Pedroso with a physician so the examination can be conducted. ICE is also unwilling to transfer Pedroso to a different jail so the examination can take place, they allege.

Pedroso’s attorneys claim ICE and the county have, in effect, denied Pedroso his status as a legal permanent resident and violated his right to due process.

“Keeping Pedroso in detention for the purpose of adjudicating his claim in immigration court transforms his detention into a punitive detention intending to punish him for the fact that he is eligible for legal permanent residency,” the lawsuit alleges.

The defendants in the case have yet to file a response.

U.S. resident for 35 years, in jail for four months

A third lawsuit involving the Polk County Jail revolves around Amir Rahimi of Centerville, a native of Iran who has lived in the United States for 35 years.

In his lawsuit against the county, ICE and DHS, Rahimi alleges he has been married to a native-born U.S. citizen for 33 years, with whom he has three children. The couple’s eldest son is in the U.S. Air Force and is currently deployed overseas, the lawsuit claims.

Rahimi alleges he was detained by federal agents when he stopped at an ICE office for a routine, scheduled appointment on July 22, 2025. At the time, he claims, ICE gave no reason for his detention except to tell him they were currently “seeking a third country for your removal” — suggesting the agency’s plan is to deport him not to Iran, but to some other country.

“After four months of detention, the legal justification for his detention still remains unclear and he has been provided with no explanation of the change in his circumstances that resulted in the deprivation of his liberty,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing Rahimi’s continued detention, citing alleged violations of Rahimi’s due process rights and the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.

Feds appeal ruling in Muscatine County case

In addition to the newly filed lawsuits, a fourth lawsuit involving the Muscatine County Jail continues to move forward despite a judge’s ruling in the case in early November.

That case centers on Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.

Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.

On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail. An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing.

Reyes sued in U.S. District Court, and on Nov. 3, 2025, Judge Locher ruled in her favor, noting that the majority of courts around the nation have rejected the administration’s interpretation of the law as requiring mandatory detention.

Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.

In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher wrote that “ICE itself obviously did not believe she was subject to mandatory detention” when they released her on how own recognizance in September 2023 and again in February 2025.

Court records indicate Reyes was granted bond after a hearing on Nov. 7, 2025, and was released from custody three days later on a $6,000 bond.

Despite Locher’s ruling and Reyes’ subsequent release, the U.S. Department of Justice is now appealing Locher’s ruling.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/prisoner-behind-bars-handcuffs-jail-prison-getty-e1673729426865-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:58:28.703684

""Officers have determined the two people were injured in the shooting involving federal agents,"" police said.","A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in a vehicle on Thursday afternoon in Portland, Oregon, after the driver allegedly tried to run over agents, a senior federal official said.

The shooting occurred a day after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good as she was driving toward him on a street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being ordered to exit her SUV by other ICE agents.

McLaughlin and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have accused Good, 37, of engaging in ""domestic terrorism,"" and claimed that she intentionally tried to run over ICE agents after blocking a residential street with her vehicle.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democratic officials have said those claims are false, pointing to videos of the shooting.

The shooting in Portland occurred at 2:19 p.m. PT, as Border Patrol agents were ""conducting a targeted vehicle stop,"" Homeland Security Department Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.

""The passenger of the vehicle and target is a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and involved in a recent shooting in Portland,"" McLaughlin said.

""The vehicle driver is believed to be a member of the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua,"" she said.

""When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents,"" McLaughlin said.

""Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots,"" she said. ""The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.""

Portland Police said the unidentified man and the woman who were shot were taken to a hospital, and that their conditions were unknown. The FBI is leading the investigation of the shooting.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, whose city has become a focus point for immigration enforcement actions by the Trump administration, in a statement, said, ""Just one day after the horrific violence in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents, our community here in Portland is now grappling with another deeply troubling incident.""

""We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,"" Wilson said.

""Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences,"" he said.

""As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.""

Portland Police Chief Bob Day, in a statement, said, ""We are still in the early stages of this incident.""

""We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,"" Day said.

Portland Police, in a statement, said they responded to a report of a shooting on Southeast Main Street, in the city's Hazelwood neighborhood.

""Officers confirmed that federal agents had been involved in a shooting,"" the statement said. ""Portland Police were not involved in the incident.""

""At 2:24 p.m., officers received information that a man who had been shot was calling and requesting help in the area of Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside,"" police said.

""Officers responded and found a male and female with apparent gunshot wounds,"" the statement said.

""Officers applied a tourniquet and summoned emergency medical personnel. The patients were transported to the hospital. Their conditions are unknown.""

""Officers have determined the two people were injured in the shooting involving federal agents,"" police said.

The FBI's Portland office, in an emailed statement to CNBC, said it was ""investigating an assault on a federal officers that happened at approximately 2:15pm near the 10000 block of Main St. in Portland involving two Customs and Border Patrol agents.""

""The two assailants fled the scene immediately following the shooting and are currently being treated for their injuries,"" the office said.

Congress has so far passed only three of the 12 annual spending bills that fund federal agencies for the current fiscal year. Failure to pass the remainder before a Jan. 30th deadline risks another shutdown just weeks after the record-setting, 43-day shutdown that occurred late last year.

Leaders from both parties endorsed the latest measure, signaling that passage is likely in the Senate as well, belatedly getting Congress halfway home in completing their work on this year's spending bills. The White House also has endorsed the measure, calling it a ""fiscally responsible bill.""

The package covers such agencies as the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Departments of Commerce and Justice. It passed by an overwhelming vote of 397-28, an unusual display of unity when it comes to government spending.

Both parties claim victories

The price tag of the bills, which Republicans put at roughly $175 billion, comes in below current levels, generating savings for taxpayers, GOP lawmakers said. Democrats countered that they were able to negotiate spending levels far above what the Trump administration had requested and removed scores of policy riders that they say would have weakened gun safety regulations, expanded oil and gas leasing on federal lands and took aim at LGBTQ and racial equity policies.

Importantly, Democrats said, the measure also includes legally binding spending requirements that restrain the White House's ability to withhold or delay funds for programs Trump opposes. Trump's first year in office was met with scores of lawsuits from states, cities and nonprofits who accused the administration of undertaking unlawful power grabs.

""This legislation is a forceful rejection of draconian cuts to public services proposed by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.

The Senate would also have to pass the measure before President Donald Trump could sign it into law. But the bill has bipartisan backing in that chamber, too.

""Republicans are strongest when we stay focused, Democrats are more effective when they negotiate in good faith, and the country is better off when Republicans and Democrats work together,"" Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in urging colleagues to vote for the bill.

Funding work is well behind schedule

In recent years, Congress has generally lumped all the spending bills into one or two measures, often voted on before lawmakers left Washington for the holidays. Lawmakers say such a process makes it easier to include provisions that couldn't pass muster on their own.

Johnson has called for returning to a time when Congress takes up the 12 spending bills separately, though he's finding it easier said than done. The fiscal year began Oct. 1 and Congress is still debating full-year funding for most federal agencies.

Democrats listed various priorities they were able to maintain or increase funding for, despite the administration's opposition. For example, a program to make homes more energy efficient for low-income Americans got a $3 million boost, instead of being eliminated as proposed by Trump. The EPA, a frequent Trump target, gets $8.8 billion. That's more than double what Trump sought.

Republicans had voiced concerns about some earmarks in the bill, now called community funding projects. To ease those concerns, a nearly $1.5 million earmark obtained by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was removed from the bill. It would have funded a Somali-led organization's efforts to provide job training and peer support services for those struggling with addiction.

Republicans have been intensely focused on allegations of fraud by day care centers run by Somali residents. Those allegations are still being investigated. Omar has urged people not to blame an entire community for the actions of a relative few.

The unusual move raised concerns of bias in the federal government’s investigation into one of its own agents.

“This is not a time to hide from the facts,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a news conference. “This is a time to embrace them, making sure that we’re pushing for transparency every step of the way.”

Trump administration officials had swiftly claimed the incident, which took place in a residential Minneapolis neighbourhood on Wednesday, was an act of “domestic terrorism”, and that the involved agent was acting in self-defence as the victim tried to run him over.

But video evidence has cast doubt over the federal government’s narrative.

Frey said it was deeply “concerning” that the Trump administration had already “come to a conclusion” about the facts of the case, long before any investigation had been completed.

Without the involvement of independent local investigators, he added, any findings by the FBI will be seen as tainted and would only further foment unrest and distrust.

“This is not some radical, way out there group,” Frey said of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which had initially been invited by the FBI to take part in the probe, before being abruptly cut out.

“This is a group that is formed by experts who understand how to investigate, many of them have been police officers themselves.”

The mayor added that people in Minneapolis are demanding “justice and the truth.”

Claims without evidence

Protests have continued across Minneapolis and other cities in the US following the killing.

Several videos of the incident on Wednesday show Good parked in the middle of the road in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV as ICE agents walked towards her vehicle.

One officer approached the driver side window, telling Good to exit the SUV, although another agent is seen waving at her, in what some say may have been a conflicting order.

Good’s vehicle is then seen reversing and then driving forward slowly. That’s when an agent standing near the front left bumper of the SUV opens fire. The vehicle continued forward down the road before crashing into a utility pole and another car.

A video of the aftermath appeared to show law enforcement agents refusing to allow an individual who identifies himself as a physician to give medical aid to Good, who was pronounced dead soon after.

Good – a 37-year-old mother of three – was dropping off her youngest child at school.

Just moments after the killing, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed in a statement that Good was a “violent rioter” who “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to “run over” law enforcement.

Hours later, Trump called Good without evidence a “professional agitator” who “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer”, blaming the incident on the “Radical left”.

The US president claimed it was “hard to believe” the involved agent was alive, despite video showing him walking around the scene after opening fire.

Joining a lengthy White House news conference on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance also presented an incendiary account of the incident, calling it “classic terrorism” and suggesting Good had been “brainwashed” by the “radical left”.

He also falsely claimed that the officer who opened fire “is protected by absolute immunity” from state prosecution because he was a federal law enforcement agent “doing his job”.

Renewed scrutiny over ICE

The shooting has brought renewed scrutiny to Trump’s mass deportation drive, which has seen his administration flood communities across the country with federal agents as it has sought to quickly grow the ballooning ranks of ICE.

Prior to the killing, The Trace news website had documented 16 incidents in which federal agents enforcing the immigration crackdown shot someone since Trump took office in January 2025. Good was among four people killed in those shootings, it said.

On Thursday, two Customs and Border Patrol agents, who fall under DHS like ICE agents, opened fire and wounded a man and a woman during a traffic stop in Portland, Oregon.

A bill signed into law by Trump in 2025 allocates $75bn for ICE’s personnel, enforcement and detention budget over the next four years – funds that far surpass the military budgets of most countries in the world.

Speaking at Friday’s news conference, Minneapolis city council member Jason Chavez said it was imperative to have an independent investigation into Good’s killing for local residents to be able to “have a sense of trust in this process”.

Good’s killing came as the administration surged ICE agents to Minneapolis in its latest targeting of Somali Americans, leaving many living in fear, he added.

In a joint statement, the licensing department and Washington State Patrol said Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action” in the face of the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement tactics.

“But he will do so with reason and care,” the agencies said. “Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law-enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety.”

Concerns over federal access to this state data date back to at least 2018. But the worries have ramped up in the past year as President Donald Trump has pushed for drastic increases in immigration enforcement and deportations. The Trump administration has focused on accessing various troves of state data to apparently fuel its immigration operations.

Over the summer, KING 5 revealed continued data sharing through the Department of Licensing’s driver and plate database, known as DAPS. The investigation found hundreds of searches of Washington records after Trump retook office, prompting outcries from immigration advocates.

After this, state officials announced they’d stop ICE from accessing Washington’s driver license data through this avenue.

Malou Chávez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s “clear that there are cracks in systems here in Washington state that need fixing to truly protect our communities.”

“Washington, as a welcoming state, cannot and should not aid the federal government in its goal of mass detention, mass deportation by providing access to information, allowing our data to be used for civil immigration enforcement when we have laws specifically prohibiting this from happening,” she told reporters.

How it works

The form of data sharing revealed Thursday forces federal agencies to use a different route than the one that drew scrutiny last year.

It’s facilitated by a nonprofit that police agencies use to share driver’s license data across states. This allows them to easily search through a platform known as Nlets for information on drivers from out of state that officers pull over.

A Washington State Patrol platform called ACCESS allows users into the state’s data held by Nlets. The Department of Licensing data shared through this platform includes drivers’ license numbers and photos, home addresses and vehicles’ registered owners, according to the UW researchers.

“These folks are real Washingtonians who have been affected,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. “They are people with lives and families and communities and rights, and they have been harmed by the fact that the DOL allows these agencies to access its data for civil and not criminal immigration enforcement.”

Call for action

In November, Democrats in Congress alerted many states that they were unknowingly sharing information with ICE.

In letters to the states’ governors, they noted Washington, along with Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, had blocked ICE access to their driver’s license data. They wrote that Washington made the move after “engaging with Congressional Democrats.”

Washington state officials said “thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied” since shutting off access to Nlets data on Nov. 19.

But this still leaves the door open for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE subagency, to continue searching Washington’s data, the UW researchers believe.

Customs and Border Protection conducted the data searches in eight of the nine arrests the center documented. Almost all of the arrests were for civil immigration enforcement, not criminal matters. Though when searching the data, the federal agencies don’t need to note if it’s for a criminal or civil investigation.

“The state is granting them that access on the good faith assumption that they’re only going to use it for criminal investigations, and the data that we’ve presented here shows that that is not the case,” Godoy said. “They are using it in ways that are contrary to state law.”

The researchers called on the state to block all federal immigration authorities from accessing Washington’s Nlets data.

“We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety,” reads the statement from the Department of Licensing and state patrol.

In an executive order in September, Ferguson ordered state agencies to “continue to review their data collection, sharing, and retention policies to ensure they are treating the protection of residents’ personal and private information as a matter of public interest and safety.”

The letters to governors, led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said that in the year preceding Oct. 1, federal immigration authorities searched driver’s license databases roughly 900,000 times across the country.

The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data. Godoy said the nine cases documented so far “likely represent the tip of the iceberg.”

Elizabeth Bope, a retired Pflugerville ISD teacher, said the claims from federal and state lawmakers that Good was attempting to strike the ICE agent with her vehicle inspired her to attend the protest.

Such claims were posted online by Vice President J.D. Vance and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Attorney General Ken Paxton reposted a statement from DHS on X, formerly known as Twitter, that said the ICE agent “relied on his training and saved his own life.”

""It's beyond really any words that they killed this woman for no reason, but also that they're lying about it,"" Bope said. ""I'm not even a radical left person, I'm just a regular old Democrat.""

Other key Texas leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have not commented on the shooting.

Chris Philp, a senior Conservative figure, said Begum had “no place” in Britain because of her support for violent extremists.","MANCHESTER, England (CN) — The European Court of Human Rights is questioning the U.K. government over its 2019 decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship, raising fresh scrutiny of a case that has long divided courts, politicians and the public.

The court confirmed it is examining whether Britain violated Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans slavery and human trafficking, when then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds.

Judges asked whether the government should have assessed whether Begum was a victim of trafficking before acting, and whether depriving her of citizenship amounted to a “penalty” under European anti-trafficking law.

The Labour government has defended the move taken by the previous Conservative administration.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government will always protect the U.K. and its citizens. That is why Shamima Begum — who posed a national security threat — had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the U.K.”

However, Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which represents Begum, said the court’s intervention marked a turning point.

The court’s communication, the firm said, presents an “unprecedented opportunity” for the U.K. and Begum to “grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous U.K. administrations.”

A challenge under Europe’s anti-trafficking law

Eric Fripp, a barrister specializing in public, immigration and asylum law at 36 Public & Human Rights, said the case raises issues not previously addressed by the European court in citizenship deprivation disputes.

He said Begum’s complaint argues British courts “erred in their approach to issues arising under Article 4” of the convention.

Britain’s own immigration tribunal, he noted, had previously found “there to be a credible suspicion” that Begum was trafficked in 2015 for the purpose of exploitation as an underage bride by ISIS.

Begum’s lawyers argue the U.K. failed to protect her before she left the country, undermined its duty to investigate trafficking by revoking her citizenship, and in 2019 did not properly assess whether she was a trafficking victim before deciding deprivation was justified.

Fripp noted that British courts have already dismissed claims that Begum was left stateless under international law, even if Bangladesh, which the U.K. says she could claim citizenship in, may neither accept her nor be safe.

He added that past challenges to citizenship removal linked to terrorism have mostly relied on Article 8 protections for private and family life, an area in which the European court has generally granted governments broad discretion.

“The Article 4 ECHR point raised by Ms. Begum is one not arising in those cases,” Fripp said, though he added that her trafficking-based claim “appears likely to face substantial challenges.”

A teenage journey to ISIS territory

Begum left London in February 2015, at age 15, with two other schoolgirls to travel to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria.

She later married an ISIS fighter and had three children, all of whom died in infancy. After three years living under ISIS rule, she was found in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019, after the terrorist group suffered major military defeats and lost territory.

That same month, Javid revoked her British citizenship under the British Nationality Act, saying it was “conducive to the public good” because she posed a national security threat. The decision left her unable to return to the U.K.

In an interview with the BBC in 2021, Begum said, “I will regret it for the rest of my life. Whether you can see it on my face or not, it kills me inside. I lose sleep over it.”

British courts repeatedly upheld the government’s decision. In 2024, the U.K. Supreme Court rejected Begum’s final appeal, ruling she could not return to Britain to argue her case in person.

She remains in a detention camp in northern Syria.

Begum filed her application to the European court in December 2024 after exhausting all legal avenues in the U.K.

Patti Tamara Lenard, a University of Ottawa ethics professor, said the move to Strasbourg appears to be Begum’s final option.

“It is hard not to read the choice to approach the ECHR with Shamima Begum’s case as a last-ditch effort to save Begum from living out the rest of her life as a stateless person in a detention camp in northern Syria,” Lenard said.

She said the court’s questions focus on whether Begum should have been treated as a trafficking victim and whether British authorities failed to protect her as a child.

“The U.K. government is very unlikely to change its mind,” Lenard said, calling the outcome a “multi-layered tragedy” driven by the state’s refusal to take responsibility for decisions made when Begum was a minor.

For Lenard, the core issue is this: “The U.K. government denationalized Begum so as to avoid taking responsibility for its own complicity in choices she made as a child, and in so doing abandoned her to fend for herself.”

Why the ECHR divides Britain

The ECHR, based in Strasbourg, enforces the European Convention on Human Rights, a postwar treaty partly shaped by British lawyers. Though separate from the European Union, its rulings are binding on the 46 Council of Europe members, including the U.K.

In recent years, the courts have become a political target in Britain, with the Conservative Party and Reform UK arguing that they undermine national sovereignty, particularly on immigration and asylum.

The previous Conservative government sought to curb the court’s influence through domestic legislation. The Labour government elected last year has ruled out leaving the convention but says reforms are needed to clarify its scope, particularly in national security cases.

Opposition parties on the right seized on the court’s latest intervention.

Chris Philp, a senior Conservative figure, said Begum had “no place” in Britain because of her support for violent extremists.

Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK, posted on X: “ECHR can jog on… none of their business … just another reason why we must leave this foreign court.”

The backstory:

The protest followed the death of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. It also came on the same day as a separate incident in Portland, Oregon, where two people were hospitalized after a shooting involving federal immigration officers.

RELATED: FBI: US border agents allegedly involved in Portland shooting, 2 people injured

What they're saying:

""We’re out here today to stand in solidarity with the folks in Minneapolis and also to remember Renee Good’s name,"" said Yunqing Zheng, who is a member of the Tampa Immigrant Rights Committee.

READ: ICE officer who fatally shot woman in Minneapolis identified

Plenty of protesters held signs, dressed in colorful costumes and waved upside-down American flags. For over an hour, the group chanted for changes to immigration enforcement policies.

""We are saying ICE out of everywhere, ICE out of our communities,"" Zheng said. ""Specifically, we also want to demand an end to 287(g) in our city.""

The other side:

The 287(g) program is a federal immigration initiative that allows local law enforcement agencies, including the Tampa Police Department, to partner with ICE. In Florida, the program has been expanded as part of a push by Governor Ron DeSantis to increase cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

In October, DeSantis said, ""We're helping deliver people here illegally to the feds and ICE and DHS, and that's continuing.""

Big picture view:

Among the group of protesters was Brandon Wagner, who raised concerns about how immigration enforcement is carried out locally.

""They feel they can do anything that they want to in our community to take away immigrants,"" he said.

Despite heightened emotions among dozens of demonstrators nationwide, the protest in Tampa remained peaceful.

""Protesting is the only way to actually affect regime change,"" Wagner concluded. ""That is something we must do. Be out in public and spread the word to others who may not know what’s going on.""

TPS provides a shield against deportation for people from counties in the middle of a humanitarian crises or armed conflict.
Since regaining office a year ago, Trump has terminated or announced intent to terminate TPS for more than 1 million individuals, according to the American Immigration Council.
The Democrats addressed their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now.","All eight Democratic U.S. representatives from Florida have signed a letter urging the Trump administration to immediately restore temporary protected status (TPS) to Venezuelans in the U.S. following the administration’s military attack on Venezuela last weekend.

TPS provides a shield against deportation for people from counties in the middle of a humanitarian crises or armed conflict. Since regaining office a year ago, Trump has terminated or announced intent to terminate TPS for more than 1 million individuals, according to the American Immigration Council.

The Democrats addressed their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

In the case of Venezuela, Noem announced in January 2025 that the administration was ending the 18-month extension of TPS for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans that former President Joe Biden had implemented just 10 days days before he left the White House. The Biden White House had said that the extension was warranted “based on the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the inhumane Maduro regime.”

The letter sent on Friday to Rubio and Noem was signed by 70 congressional Democrats.

“Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS … are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger — conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro,” the letter says. “Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.”

“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the letter adds. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now. This termination of lawful status has caused unimaginable fear and anxiety for law-abiding Venezuelan families, who passed criminal background checks, earned work permits, and paid fees and taxes.”

The Democrats go on to say in the letter that the Trump administration has “abandoned the Venezuelans that remain in Venezuela who yearn for freedom and a democratic transition,” noting how Maduro’s “criminal accomplices remain in power,” specifically mentioning interim president Delcy Rodriguez, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello (who was indicted on narco-terrorism charges alongside Maduro by the U.S. Justice Department in 2020).

“We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado,” the Democrats write.

This news follows reporting from The Associated Press that federal immigration officers originally deployed to Louisiana will be sent to assist in the Minneapolis operation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was initially expected to send around 2,000 immigration agents to the state.

The operation, which DHS said would be its “largest ever,” comes amid the administration’s probe into welfare fraud in the North Star State — with 85 of the defendants being of Somali descent. Federal prosecutors estimate that billions of dollars were potentially lost in this scheme.

The presence of immigration officers in Minnesota has raised tensions to a boiling point after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good, in her vehicle on Wednesday.

DHS defended the officer’s actions as self-defense, with department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claiming Macklin Good was attempting to run the officer over with her car in an “act of domestic terrorism.”

“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin posted on the social platform X after the shooting.

President Trump, Vice President Vance, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other White House officials have backed up that explanation in recent days.

However, multiple state officials have disputed this account of events, pointing to footage of the incident shared online.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) called DHS’ account “bullsh–.”

“This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,” Frey said at a Wednesday press conference. He doubled down on the remarks on Thursday, including his request that ICE officials ‘get the f— out‘ of the city.

Protests are continuing to be held in Minnesota and across the country after the shooting. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered at the site of the fatal interaction in Minneapolis to commemorate the life of Macklin Good.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), who announced earlier this week that he would not seek reelection, also authorized the state’s National Guard to be “staged and ready” as demonstrations spring up.

Attorney General Pam Bondi warned Thursday that protesters should not “test our resolve” and avoid “obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement.”

MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Today, an Alabama appeals court ruled that the state can require freestanding birth centers to be licensed and regulated as hospitals, potentially subjecting them to overly restrictive licensing rules that would make it effectively impossible for them to provide midwifery care in the state. The court’s ruling overturns a May 2025 trial court decision in favor of the birth centers, but it will not take effect while the birth centers seek further court review. In the meantime, birth centers in the state will be able to continue providing care.

Freestanding birth centers are independent facilities that provide safe, evidence-backed midwifery care to low-risk patients in a homelike setting. Since an Alabama state trial court blocked the Alabama Department of Public Health’s attempt to restrict access to birth center-provided care in September 2023, birth centers like Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham and Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville have been safely operating and providing essential care for pregnant Alabamians.

As today’s court decision recognized, birth centers play an important role in expanding access to pregnancy-related care, “particularly [for] low-income and marginalized populations who, historically, have suffered inequitable disparities” in accessing care. Amid the state’s maternal and infant health crisis, which disproportionately impacts Black women and families, Alabamians with low incomes, and rural communities, it is more important than ever to preserve access to these options for birth center care, which evidence shows is safe and improves patient outcomes, including by reducing preterm births and unnecessary cesarean sections.

“We are disappointed in the Court of Civil Appeals’ decision, but this isn’t the end,” said Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. “We will continue to fight for pregnant Alabamians to be able to access high-quality midwifery care in birth centers without burdensome and unnecessary interference from the state. The essential care birth centers provide to Alabama families has never been more necessary than it is right now, with Alabama facing a serious maternal and infant health crisis that is disproportionately affecting Black Alabamians, those with low incomes, and rural communities. The care birth centers like Oasis Family Birth Center and Alabama Birth Center provide is a critical part of addressing this crisis and ensuring that all pregnant folks have access to high-quality, patient-centered health care.”

“The opinion from the Court of Civil Appeals is disappointing, but we remain committed to ensuring that birth centers can continue providing essential healthcare in Alabama,” said JaTaune Bosby-Gilchrist, the ACLU of Alabama’s executive director. “Birth centers are needed here. Midwives and doulas are needed here. And we are committed to continuing this fight on behalf of our clients and all Alabamians.”

The lawsuit, Oasis Family Birthing Center et. al. v. Alabama Department of Public Health, was originally filed in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court in Montgomery in August 2023. The plaintiffs – Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham, Heather Skanes, M.D., Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville, Yashica Robinson, M.D., the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, Jo Crawford, CPM, and Tracie Stone, CPM – are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Alabama, Covington & Burling LLP, and Bobby Segall of Copeland Franco.

Oasis Family Birthing Center et. al. v. Alabama Department of Public Health

A group of midwives and doctors filed a lawsuit in state court challenging actions by the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH), which imposed a de facto ban on freestanding birth centers throughout Alabama. Birth centers provide midwifery care to low-risk pregnant patients, a model of care that is proven to be safe and beneficial to patients. Despite that, ADPH took actions that forced one center to abruptly shut down in 2023 despite a perfect safety record, and then passed onerous regulations that would require birth centers to meet hospital-like standards, preventing birth centers from operating in the state. After hearing oral argument in late September 2023, the Circuit Court of Montgomery County granted our request for a Preliminary Injunction on September 30, 2023, preventing ADPH from refusing to timely license freestanding birth centers that comply with nationally-recognized safety standards for birth centers while litigation continues. In May 2025, the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court permanently blocking the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) from regulating freestanding birth centers like hospitals and imposing onerous licensing rules that would have made it effectively impossible for these centers to provide evidence-based midwifery care in the state. The ruling ensures that plaintiffs Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham and Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville, which have been safely operating for the past year, may continue providing midwifery care to pregnant Alabamians.

Two days after the federal officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good on a residential street, immigration agents remained in Minneapolis, public schools were closed and the Minnesota National Guard was activated in what Gov. Tim Walz’s office described as a precautionary move.

State and local officials have pressed for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to be allowed to investigate the shooting of Ms. Good alongside the F.B.I., as was initially announced in the hours after the shooting on Wednesday. But after the Trump administration and Minnesota’s Democratic leaders sparred over the circumstances of the killing, state officials said on Thursday that state investigators had been denied access to evidence and were withdrawing from the case.

“Our ask is to embrace the truth,” Mayor Jacob Frey said on Friday, adding that he was worried that the federal government had already concluded that the shooting was justified. “Our ask is to include the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in this process, because we in Minneapolis want a fair investigation.”

On Friday, the Hennepin County attorney, Mary Moriarty, and the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, announced that they would collect evidence submitted by civilians that would be publicly posted online and could be used in an independent investigation.

“I have been on the phone and in meetings with law enforcement, justice leaders and elected officials, discussing ways to ensure a thorough and transparent investigation can occur and be shared with our office,” Ms. Moriarty said in a statement.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said on Thursday that state investigators were not cut out and that “they don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.” State prosecutors would face significant legal and practical obstacles if they sought to file criminal charges against the ICE officer who opened fire.

The tension in Minneapolis comes months into a campaign by the Trump administration to increase immigration enforcement in Democratic-led states and cities. In Portland, Ore., another place singled out for criticism, Border Patrol agents shot two people during what they called a “targeted vehicle stop.”

The shooting of Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen, came after weeks of mounting disagreements and heated rhetoric between the White House and the Democrats who run the state.

Over the objections of local leaders, some 2,000 federal officers were said this week to be deploying to Minnesota to arrest illegal immigrants and investigate fraud in state social service programs. On Wednesday morning, just days into the stepped-up campaign, agents confronted Ms. Good as she partially blocked a snowy residential street.

When agents approached her S.U.V. on foot and demanded that she get out, Ms. Good disobeyed and began to drive away. A video analysis showed that Ms. Good’s vehicle appeared to be turning away from the officer who opened fire.

Becca Good, Renee Nicole Good’s wife, said a statement to MPR News that on Wednesday, she and Renee Good “stopped to support our neighbors.”

“We had whistles,” she wrote. “They had guns.”

“I am now left to raise our son and to continue teaching him, as Renee believed, that there are people building a better world for him. That the people who did this had fear and anger in their hearts, and we need to show them a better way,” she said.

The White House has described the shooting as a lawful act of self-defense, while Minnesota leaders have labeled the federal account as “bullshit” or “propaganda” and have demanded that ICE leave the state.

“What we are seeing right now, it’s authoritarianism,” said Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a Democrat who is running for U.S. Senate.

“In the face of violent attacks, ICE law enforcement arrested pedophiles, rapists and drug traffickers in Minneapolis,” Tricia McLaughlin, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement.

Attorney General Pam Bondi warned Minnesota demonstrators not to obstruct or attack federal law enforcement, saying, “Do not test our resolve.”

Officials in Minnesota said residents were angry, nervous and eager for ICE to leave. As protesters have gathered by the thousands this week, both Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey have urged them to remain peaceful, saying that they believed the Trump administration was looking for a pretext to send in federal troops. Early on Friday morning, city crews removed barriers blocking streets near the site of the shooting.

Mr. Walz activated the Minnesota National Guard on Thursday but did not immediately send them into the streets. He said the soldiers would be prepared to assist local law enforcement officers if needed. He said there was “every reason to believe that peace will hold.”

State Representative Esther Agbaje, a Minneapolis Democrat, said that she hoped “that the federal government kind of pulls back from Minnesota.”

“People are scared,” Ms. Agbaje said. “People are not going to school. People are not going to work. People are not going to the grocery store. I don’t think that that’s how people should be living.”

After bipartisan negotiations, the legislation passed this week increases spending above 2025 levels, a complete repudiation of President Trump’s budget request, which would have decimated housing programs and severely weakened many other critical initiatives that help address the cost-of-living crisis. It also reasserts Congress’ power of the purse with instilling transparency and accountability requirements.

“Keeping our government funded and functioning is a fundamental responsibility of Congress,” said Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher. “For the past year, however, President Trump and Congressional Republicans have fought at every turn to eliminate funding for government programs that people across Texas’ Seventh Congressional District rely on. I am pleased that, after months of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, we have come to a bipartisan agreement to reinstate funding for government programs that the administration gutted—a rebuke of DOGE and Republican efforts to eliminate critical funding.

“Specifically, I am proud that my efforts to provide federal funding for natural disaster research and preparedness, to provide immigration court counsel, and to support emissions-reducing technology in the energy sector succeeded,” continued Congresswoman Fletcher. “I will continue to do everything I can to fight back against the Trump administration’s and Congressional Republicans’ dangerous and harmful efforts and protect our community.”

Last year, Congresswoman Fletcher led an effort to reject President Trump’s attempt to gut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and instead fund it at a level of at least $656 million. Following her advocacy, H.R. 6938 provides $588 million, 74 percent higher than President Trump’s budget request.

Also last year, Congresswoman Fletcher spearheaded an effort to protect funding for the Legal Orientation Program (LOP), which the Trump administration attempted to terminate earlier this year and is currently being litigated in court. The LOP is a critical program that contracts with nonprofit legal service organizations to assist detained individuals to make timely and informed decisions on immigration court procedures, educating people on their rights and improving the judicial efficiency of the immigration courts. Following Congresswoman Fletcher’s advocacy, H.R. 6938 provides $27.5 million of her $28 million request for the Legal Orientation Program (LOP).

And, last year, Congresswoman Fletcher led an effort to protect funding to support emissions-reducing technology in the energy sector. Following Congresswoman Fletcher’s advocacy, H.R. 6938 provides $30 million for the Department of Energy’s Methane Mitigation Program, which is an improvement from President Trump’s budget request, which would have eliminated funding for this program.

Additionally, for FY 2026, H.R. 6938:

Funds the Legal Services Corporation at $540 million, after President Trump and House Republicans attempted to eliminate the agency in its entirety;

Funds the Minority Business Development Agency at $50 million, after President Trump and House Republicans attempted to eliminate the agency in its entirety;

Funds the National Endowment for the Arts at $207 million, after President Trump and House Republicans attempted to eliminate the agency in its entirety;

Tensions reached a fever pitch almost immediately after an ICE officer shot and killed a woman in her vehicle at the site of agency enforcement activity in Minneapolis, which was captured on video by several bystanders. President Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, Homeland Security Department Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials quickly denounced Renee Nicole Good, the deceased woman, for protesting against ICE and allegedly obstructing its law enforcement operations.

Trump administration officials have gestured toward the need to let an investigation play out, but not before exonerating the officer with their rhetoric and castigating Good as bringing her death upon herself. Noem, like the president, accused the late mother of three of being a “domestic terrorist” before saying DHS would follow “the same policies and procedures” it would in any use-of-force incident. The investigation will show the ICE officer did “everything right,” Noem said on Thursday.

Mat Silverman, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, was critical of Good for not following what appeared to be conflicting orders from ICE personnel telling her to move and exit her vehicle, but said all involved parties should “let the facts come out before we say anything.” While he appreciated the administration’s adamant defense of federal law enforcement personnel, he said its quick and inflammatory response could have deleterious effects.

“It’s going to hurt the citizens that think the officers are out there doing things that they shouldn’t be doing,” Silverman told Government Executive. “When you make statements like that, it's going to hurt the public trust.”

A former ICE official with more than three decades of federal law enforcement experience said his colleagues have largely expressed reservations about jumping to any conclusions. Non-law enforcement immigration officers, like those who adjudicate asylum, have expressed apprehension about the ICE officer’s action, the former official said. Some law enforcement personnel quickly spoke up to defend the officer, he said, though many have said everyone should “wait for more information.”

Even Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, said it would be “unprofessional” to attribute blame ahead of a full probe of the situation.

“It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation,” Homan told CBS News. “Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.”

Homan subsequently released a statement calling ICE personnel heroes who have the right to self defense.

In videos released from the incident, ICE officers are seen approaching Good’s vehicle that is stopped perpendicular to the street. As she accelerates and turns to the right away from them, one officer who had been in front of the vehicle fires one shot through the windshield and two more through the driver’s side window. The car then continues away from the officers before crashing and coming to a stop.

According to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, it and the FBI agreed on Wednesday to carry out a joint investigation into the incident. The FBI subsequently told BCA that the FBI would lead the investigation alone.

“The BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,” said BCA Superintendent Drew Evans, whose Force Investigations Unit was created in 2020 to probe law enforcement use of force incidents.

He added BCA could not meet its investigative standards without access to all the relevant evidence and interviews. While his office therefore had to step down, he was hopeful the state could still leave the door open to potential prosecution.

“We expect the FBI to conduct a thorough and complete investigation and that the full investigative file will be shared with the appropriate prosecutorial authorities at both the state and federal levels,” Evans said.

Ahead of that investigation, Noem stated the ICE officer acted appropriately.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation and took action to defend himself and defend his fellow law enforcement officers,” the secretary said.

ICE has more than doubled its workforce since Trump took office last year, resulting from the rapid onboarding of more than 12,000 officers and agents. DHS said many thousands of those new hires are already in the field.

The speed of deployment reflects DHS shortening the training for ICE agents from six months to around six weeks, allowing newly onboarded staff to quickly get into the field. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, which handles training for more than 75 federal law enforcement agencies, has also severely curtailed its operations for non-ICE personnel to enable the agency’s recruits to deploy more rapidly.

The officer involved in the shooting, however, has years of experience, administration officials said. He was previously involved in a vehicle-based incident, which resulted in him being dragged and in need of dozens of stitches. While the officer was able to quickly step to the side of the vehicle, the former ICE agent said it would be instinctive to still fire off several shots due to standard officer training.

The officer’s experience, according to FLEOA’s Silverman, a U.S. Marshal who has served in government since 2001, will be relevant to the FBI’s investigation.

As investigators probe how the individual assessed his danger, they take into account whether he was previously involved in a shooting or had ever been hit by a car. Silverman said he expected everyone involved had already sat for interviews and the officer who fatally shot Good would be ""on administrative leave for a long time"" in part to allow that person to clear his head and decompress. He noted the subjectivity that can go into the review of such an individual’s actions.

“Is it 100% he should have shot? I’m not going to say that,” Silverman said. “I don’t know what was going through his mind at that time. I don’t know what he’s been through in his life prior to that.”

Asked if the ICE employee was still in the field, Noem said the individual went to the hospital, was released and is now spending time with family.

Democratic lawmakers denounced the shooting and called for various levels of oversight. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top Democratic on the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that oversees DHS funding, said lawmakers cannot pass a spending bill for the department without placing new restrictions on ICE officers. The DHS appropriations bill is one of six lawmakers are still negotiating ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline.

Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Vance implored the American public to take out their frustrations with politicians and not with federal law enforcement personnel who carry out their policies.

“This past year, Americans in cities across the United States have felt the chaos and terror of Secretary Noem’s Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

“The officer who killed Renee Good used excessive force,” added Congresswoman McCollum. “Video evidence from multiple sources on the scene show that the officer and his ICE colleagues were not in immediate danger when he shot her as he stood by her car.

“The tragedy that occurred in Minneapolis was predictable and preventable.

“Instead of accepting responsibility, Secretary Noem deliberately and immediately began seeding a false narrative, sharing inaccurate information, and blaming the victim for her own death at the hands of a federal agent. Before Renee Good was even identified as the victim of this shooting, Secretary Noem appeared before the media and falsely characterized Ms. Good as a ‘domestic terrorist.’ This highly inappropriate comment, along with offensive comments from the President and Vice President, demonstrate the Trump Administration's inability to oversee an independent investigation alongside the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA).

“Following the horrific shooting on Wednesday, Secretary Noem should have ended ICE’s operations in Minnesota to allow local law enforcement officials to restore order and a full investigation of the incident by the FBI and BCA. Instead, she further inflamed the volatile situation by allowing her unprofessional ICE agents to raid Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis, during which students witnessed teachers being assaulted by ICE agents. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go.”

After an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis this week, firing his weapon as she attempted to drive away, protesters have amassed around the country, many wondering: Can that officer be taken to court?

The Trump administration, predictably, says the agent, Jonathan Ross, is immune from prosecution. “You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday. “That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.”

But what do independent attorneys say? After the shooting, I reached out to Robert Bennett, a veteran lawyer in Minneapolis who has worked on hundreds of federal court police misconduct cases during his 50-year career. “I’ve deposed thousands of police officers,” he says. “ICE agents do not have absolute immunity.”

Bennett says the state of Minnesota has the right to prosecute an ICE agent who commits misconduct. But, he adds, that might be difficult now that the FBI has essentially booted the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension off the case—blocking access, the BCA wrote, to “case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.”

In the conversation below, edited for length and clarity, Bennett discusses how the shooting in Minneapolis unfolded and the legal paths forward.

When you watched the videos of this shooting, what did you see?

You saw what could be easily identified as four ICE officers. And they’re all experiencing, to a greater or lesser extent, the same set of operative facts, the same factual stimuli. But only one officer, seeing the set of circumstances, picked up his weapon. None of the other officers did. That’s a bad fact [for Ross].

Also, the officer walked in front of the car, which counts against him in the reasonableness analysis. If you look at the recent Supreme Court case of Barnes v. Felix, that’s problematic for the ICE agent.

What happened in Barnes v. Felix?

It’s a shooting case where the officer walked around the car, [lunged

and jumped onto the door sill], and put himself in harm’s way. You can’t bootstrap your own bad situation [to] allow a use of force.

What did the court find?

They sent it back to the trial court to consider it. But there’s good language in there.

You said it’s bad news for the ICE agent, Ross, that his colleagues didn’t pull their weapons. Can you talk more about that?

Sure, we’ve had several other cases. There was a tactical semicircle, a bunch of officers aiming their guns at a couple fighting over a knife; one officer out of the eight or nine fired his weapon, none of the others perceived the need to.

And that’s important because it suggests the officer who fired wasn’t reasonable, right? Under federal law, an officer can only use deadly force if they had a reasonable fear that they could otherwise be killed or harmed.

It’s an objective reasonableness standard. So it’s not whether you were personally scared out of your wits and fired your gun. It’s: Would an objectively reasonable officer at the scene have fired his weapon, believing he was in danger of death or immediate bodily harm?

In Ross’ case, there was a previous incident—Ross had shot [with a Taser] through a window before at somebody in the car, and the guy hit the gas, and Ross had stuck his arm through the broken window, and he got cut [and dragged about 100 yards]. And so he was supposedly reacting to that. He’s not an objective officer at that point.

The Trump administration has suggested that Ross is immune from prosecution as a federal officer. Why do you say he’s not?

There’s plenty of case law that allows for the prosecution of federal law enforcement agencies, including ICE. And it’s clear under the law that a federal officer who shoots somebody in Minnesota and kills them is subject to a Minnesota investigation and Minnesota law.

Now, the feds just took that away this morning, and they’ve already decided who’s at fault. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was going to do an investigation to find out.

But I can tell you, the federal code provides that when there is a state criminal prosecution of a federal officer in Minnesota or any other state, the officer has the right to remove the case to federal court. So if Ross was charged in Hennepin County, he could remove the case to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, have a federal judge deal with his case. The code is explicitly predicting such a prosecution could take place. If there was immunity of an absolute nature, you wouldn’t need that section, right?

The administration seems to argue that Ross is protected under the Supremacy Clause, which essentially says that states can’t charge a federal officer if the officer was acting within the scope of his duties.

Do you think killing people is acting within the scope of their duties? What if they decided to kill the 435,000 people in the city of Minneapolis while they were here, would the Supremacy Clause give them a free pass? I don’t think so.

Also, if there was an actual independent investigation, and you apply the actual federal case law to this, and you concluded that Ross violated her rights by using excessive deadly force, he could be indicted federally. Now, nobody believes that would ever happen now: For a guy who talked a lot about rigged things, this [investigation] is rigged. Kash Patel took over the autopsy, so who knows, maybe they’ll say she died of a heart attack when she was backing up.

If the officer isn’t charged criminally, the other route is a lawsuit. What are the challenges there?",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260108-shootingvideo.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-09 18:58:10.186999

Campaigns against companies like these can play a crucial role in generating further momentum against ICE, Trump, and their worst corporate collaborators.

Local targets can be found in communities across the country, where hundreds of smaller business have ICE contracts.","Renee Nicole Good’s murder by an ICE agent in Minneapolis has left millions of Americans wondering how we can stop ICE from terrorizing our communities any further. There are many well-known ICE-fighting tactics that we can and should use, like protests, know-your-rights trainings, and neighborhood watches. But two recent victories show a promising, relatively underutilized path forward—one that deserves to be pursued further: We can target businesses that work with ICE.

ICE relies heavily on the private sector to help carry out its Gestapo-like crusade against immigrants and their allies. Without the logistical, financial, and political support of business, its capacity to terrorize our communities would crumble.

Over the past week, activists around the country successfully pushed Avelo Airlines to stop running deportation charter flights, and workers in Minneapolis pushed a local Hilton affiliate to stop renting rooms to ICE agents. But these wins are just a fraction of what could be achieved if the millions of people who are outraged by ICE’s thuggery organize to pressure all companies to stop working with ICE.

Anti-authoritarian scholars and organizers stress that the most important thing for pro-democracy movements to do is to peel away a regime’s “pillars of support.” Even the most despotic of regimes can’t rule without the backing or consent of powerful external institutions. Businesses are society’s most important non-state institutions, and most of the biggest ones in America are collaborating with Trump, making themselves a very steady pillar of support for his rule.

These mega-corporations have immense financial and political power. It may seem like there’s nothing to be done to bring them to heel. But the successes with Avelo Airlines and the Minneapolis Hilton—as well as earlier pressure campaigns like the #Tesla Takedown, the fight to force Disney to rehire Jimmy Kimmel, and the boycott of Target over its Trump-friendly anti-DEI moves—show the immense leverage that consumers and workers have when provided an opportunity. We are not powerless, and there are concrete actions anyone can take to start eroding Trump’s support from big business.

Consumer pressure campaigns can start with petition gathering and social media callouts, then escalate to coordinated one-day boycotts. Workers have even more leverage: Employees can circulate internal petitions calling on their CEOs to cut ties with ICE and organize collective actions like sick-outs.

Tactics can include rallies in front of targeted stores, leafleting customers about a company’s ICE contracts or collaboration, and nonviolent civil disobedience that makes clear that business as usual won’t stand. Other creative ideas include setting up anonymous tip lines for employees to whistleblow on non-public ICE collaborations, pressuring job sites like Monster.com and Indeed to stop featuring ICE job listings, asking local small businesses to post “Immigrants Welcome Here” placards, and writing online reviews calling out companies’ collaboration with ICE.

The key is providing people with concrete, outward-facing activities they can take right now, while building an escalating national campaign that can culminate in larger coordinated days of nonviolent disruption—for example, on May 1, 2026.

National online mass calls and trainings can give large numbers of people the tools they need to get started. National unions, immigrant rights groups, and organizations like Indivisible and the Democratic Socialists of America can leverage their volunteer activists and resources to help launch and support the campaign. And high-profile politicians like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Chris Murphy, and Zohran Mamdani can use their platforms to build momentum around this urgent fight.

The most strategic corporate targets fall into three categories: low-lift national targets, high-lift national targets, and local targets.

Low-lift national targets are mostly public-facing companies with relatively small ICE contracts that are set to expire soon, making them particularly vulnerable to consumer and employee pressure. Campaigns against companies like these can play a crucial role in generating further momentum against ICE, Trump, and their worst corporate collaborators.

Here are some examples:

Dell ($18.8 million contract with ICE for Microsoft software licenses, expiring March 2026)

UPS ($90,500 small-package delivery contract with ICE, expiring March 2026)

FedEx ($1 million delivery services contract with ICE, expiring March 2026)

Motorola Solutions ($15.6 million tactical communication infrastructure contract with ICE, expiring May 2026)

Comcast ($24,600 Internet services contract for ICE Seattle office, expiring May 2026. This could be a great fight for newly elected Mayor Katie Wilson to take on.)

AT&T ($83 million IT and network contract with ICE, with a potential end date of July 2032)

LexisNexis ($21 million data-brokerage contract with ICE. This company is particularly vulnerable to pressure from university students and professor unions, since much of its revenue comes from colleges.)

Home Depot and Lowe’s are using AI-powered license plate readers and feeding this data into law enforcement surveillance systems accessible to ICE. Their parking lots are also regular sites of ICE raids targeting day laborers.

Ad Policy

High-lift national targets have deeper relationships with ICE, and will be harder to pressure. But two in particular need to be tackled.

Amazon provides ICE with the digital backbone for its data and surveillance operations through Amazon Web Services. Amazon’s Whole Foods stores are a rich potential target for nonviolent disruption on big days of action.

Palantir provides ICE with core data platforms that integrate and analyze information from many databases so agents can search, link, and manage deportation operations.

It will take longer to force these behemoths—the two worst corporate collaborators with ICE—to cut their ties, but it’s essential to publicize their centrality to Trump’s deportation machine.

Local targets can be found in communities across the country, where hundreds of smaller business have ICE contracts. Local activists can research and target these businesses—from contractors providing services to ICE offices to suppliers selling equipment—creating distributed pressure campaigns in every region where ICE operates. Hotels that rent rooms to ICE agents are particularly vulnerable targets, as the Minneapolis example demonstrated, and hospitality unions can play a key role in these campaigns.

Breaking companies from ICE is a winnable struggle that can put serious pressure on the administration by raising the political cost of mass deportations and damaging ICE’s ability to function. No administration can survive long without the consent of corporate America.

Obviously, the stakes are highest for our undocumented friends and family members. But this fight impacts all of us. To stop Trump’s authoritarian oligarchy, we need millions of people—well beyond our normal circles of activists—to join the fight.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254733987.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 18:58:14.374426

While the Court does not announce decisions in advance, the reporting points to the recent scheduling of an opinion release session at 10 a.m. as a plausible window for a tariff ruling.

The justices will be deciding whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, China, and other trading partners. Both the U.S. Court of International Trade and the Federal Circuit have already held that IEEEPA does not permit tariffs.

Why This Decision Matters

If the Supreme Court invalidates the tariffs, the immediate question will be whether refunds are owed and who is positioned to obtain them.

Estimates of potential refunds circulating in news coverage are in the $150 billion to $200 billion range. At the same time, the government has signaled resistance to refunding duties outside of litigation, setting the stage for complex remedial and procedural battles.

Conversely, if the Court upholds the tariffs, the decision would reinforce the government’s ability to rely on emergency powers to impose broad trade measures, reshaping future trade and compliance risk.

Refund Lawsuits Already Pending

As we outlined in our December alert, timing is critical to the issue of entitlement to refunds. Many 2025 entries were scheduled to liquidate beginning mid-December. Once an entry liquidates, refund rights may be lost or become significantly more difficult to pursue.

Against that backdrop, importers have been filing protective lawsuits in the U.S. Court of International Trade, following the approach taken by Costco, to secure individualized judgments and to seek injunctions suspending liquidation while the Supreme Court case is pending. Multiple importer cases have been consolidated before a three-judge CIT panel to address common legal and injunction issues efficiently.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15673_4521.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:57:43.667745

According to a police report, officers saw a white van, but did not have a clear view of it. A vehicle then drove down to the officers and stated they were leaving. The driver said they were with ICE, but did not show identification, according to the report.

Officers checked the area where the van was located and found several unmarked Ford Explorer SUVs nearby. At that time, one vehicle drove toward officers and the driver said they were leaving after making arrests. That driver had their full ICE uniform on, according to the report.

(The ICE agent in question suffered no apparent injuries, and was seen walking around the scene after the shooting happened.)","President Donald Trump and other administration officials are pushing a false narrative regarding the horrific killing of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE agent on Wednesday morning.

The woman, identified as Renee Nicole Good, had parked her car in the middle of a residential street as demonstrators were taking part in a protest against the agency. Video of the incident shows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents approach her van, at which point she attempts to drive off. An ICE agent near the front-left side of her vehicle then pulls out a gun and opens fire as she drives away from him, shooting her in the face.

Good’s vehicle then crashes into another one further down the road. Additional video appears to show that ICE agents on the scene refused to allow onlookers to give Good medical attention, and denied a man who identified himself as a physician from treating her.

Hours after the shooting, Trump met with reporters from The New York Times for a scheduled interview. At one point, the interviewers asked Trump his thoughts about Good’s killing.

The president described the incident as a “vicious situation that took place.” He then blamed Good, not the ICE agent who shot her, for her death.

“She behaved horribly. And then she ran him over,” Trump said, peddling an account of events that is contradicted by video footage of the incident from multiple angles.

Trump doubled down on that falsehood: “She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over,” he insisted.

When the interviewers told Trump that video of the incident didn’t show what he claimed, he continued with the lie. “I’ll play the tape for you right now,” he said, signaling his aides to bring him a laptop.

As Trump and the reporters watched a slow-motion video of the shooting, the reporters told him the angle they watched didn’t appear to show that the agent was run over at all.

“Well, the way I look at it…it’s a terrible scene,” Trump said in response, refusing to acknowledge his errant descriptions of the incident from moments before.

Trump also referenced the shooting twice on Truth Social on Wednesday, both times blaming Good for her own killing.

In his first post published in the afternoon, Trump wrongly said Good had “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”

“It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump added. (The ICE agent in question suffered no apparent injuries, and was seen walking around the scene after the shooting happened.)

In his second post, which was published late on Wednesday evening (possibly after the Times interview had ended), Trump doubled down on his assertions. “When a vehicle is coming at you and is being used as a weapon, deadly force is justified,” Trump wrote, citing comments from Fox News contributor Nicole Parker.

Other members of the Trump administration echoed the president’s lies about the incident.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, for example, described Good’s actions as a “domestic act of terrorism,” wrongly claiming the Minneapolis resident tried “to kill law enforcement officers.”

Vice President JD Vance also pinned the blame on Good in a post on X.

“Every congressional democrat and every democrat who’s running for president should be asked a simple question: Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?” he wrote.

Multiple analyses and witness accounts contradict this account.

An examination of the killing by The New York Times noted that the ICE agent who shot Good “crosses toward the left of the vehicle and grabs his gun.”

“He opens fire on the motorist and continues shooting as she drives past,” the analysis states, adding:

The moment the agent fires, he is standing to the left of the SUV and the wheels are pointing to the right away from the agent. This appears to conflict with allegations that the SUV was ramming or about to ram the officer.

One witness, who went only by the name “Betsy,” told ABC News that Good was not intending anything harmful when she drove her van away.

“It appeared to me that she was endeavoring to kind of adjust her car so that it was facing more south,” Betsy said. “And then it was clear at one point that she started to accelerate, trying to move her vehicle out of the cluster of cars south on Portland Avenue.”

After the shooting of two National Guard members in November, allegedly carried out by an Afghan national, President Donald Trump issued a sweeping set of policy changes increasing scrutiny on and halting applications from immigrants from “high-risk countries of concern” under travel restrictions.

But in the weeks since, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has also canceled citizenship interviews for lawful permanent residents from countries not targeted by the Trump administration’s travel restrictions, according to Seattle-area immigration lawyers and service providers. Citizenship interviews and oath ceremonies in other states have also reportedly been canceled.

Seattle’s Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs operates a program supporting 10 community-based organizations to provide citizenship assistance like legal representation and classes. Since early December, all of them have seen citizenship interviews and oath ceremony appointments abruptly canceled for their clients, including over 80 naturalization interviews.

Before the holidays, nearly all interviews scheduled through Jan. 17 were also abruptly canceled, affecting people of all nationalities and beyond the expanded travel ban list, according to city staff.

At Asian Counseling and Referral Service in Seattle, which receives city funds, 55 people as of Tuesday had seen their scheduled citizenship interviews canceled in the wake of Trump’s latest immigration crackdown. Of those, 49 are immigrants from countries not on Trump’s travel ban list, including Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Ecuador, Mexico and Samoa.

The cancellations — with no immediate explanation from USCIS officials or details about rescheduling — is “unprecedented,” said Alexandra Olins, director of employment and citizenship services. The USCIS notices to applicants state the cancellations were “due to unforeseen circumstances.”

“This is cancellation across the board, total sand in the gears,” Olins said. “We just feel so powerless — like, what are we supposed to tell people?”

In response to questions about the canceled appointments, USCIS spokesperson Matthew J. Tragesser said the agency is implementing a “commonsense approach to balancing out workloads at offices across the country.”

“For years, the Biden administration prioritized rubber-stamping naturalization applications above all other adjudications,” Tragesser said in a statement. “Rigorous screening and vetting remains a top priority and USCIS will not take shortcuts in the adjudications process.”

Canceling appointments doesn’t make the U.S. safer or more efficient, OIRA director Hamdi Mohamed said in a statement.

“It just creates fear, confusion, and unnecessary backlogs,” she said.

Those backlogs are expensive, she added. They force cases to be reprocessed, waste government resources and delay people from “fully participating in the workforce and civic life,” she said.

Cancellations bring anxiety

On Dec. 2, USCIS detailed the Trump administration’s overhaul of the legal immigration process. Among the changes: the halting of all asylum decisions for people currently in the U.S.; the suspension of special immigrant visas issued to Afghans who assisted U.S. forces; the pause of immigration applications filed by nationals from 19 countries, mostly in the Middle East or Africa.

The citizenship interview is one of the last steps in the process for lawful permanent residents seeking to naturalize. To be eligible, an immigrant generally needs to have been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years. During the interview, applicants complete a civics test in-person and are asked questions about their background and application by a USCIS official.

By the time an applicant is interviewed, they’ve already had their fingerprints collected and passed a background check conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Olins said. That’s on top of all the other vetting during the process to secure a green card, she said. If a green card holder’s naturalization application is approved, they must then take an oath of allegiance to the U.S. in a formal ceremony.

The cancellations have left many green card holders panicking about their casein light of the Trump administration’s aggressive rhetoric and policies focused on immigrants living in the U.S., including those here legally.

In March, the Department of Homeland Security terminated a $35 million federal program that funded citizenship assistance. In August, USCIS announced new “anti-Americanism” screening for immigrants, without clearly defining what would constitute such sentiments, and new standards for “good moral character.”

In December, the Trump administration issued guidance to USCIS field offices asking they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month,” The New York Times reported. By comparison, just over 120 cases were filed in the last nine years.

Cindy Liou, Director of Legal Strategy for OneAmerica, described the cancellations as “yet another way that the Trump administration is attacking our immigrant communities and weakening our democracy.”

“These are people who have been here for years, built their lives here,” Liou said in a statement. “Any delay in the final steps in the already rigorous process to becoming a U.S. citizen throws individuals’ lives into chaos and deeply harms our communities.”

Many green card holders have spent years studying for the test and practicing their English in anticipation for the citizenship interview, taking classes between jobs and family care duties, Olins said. Some ACRS clients have told case managers they are considering withdrawing their application entirely, she said, fearing additional scrutiny under the Trump administration.

Refugee Women’s Alliance in Seattle, which offers citizenship classes in a number of languages, has also seen clients from countries without travel restrictions affected by cancellations, said Seattle immigration attorney Gizachew Manahle, who works with the nonprofit.

Green card holders whose applications have stalled have limited options for recourse, Manahle said.

They can file a lawsuit in federal district court to force the U.S. government to review their case and make a decision, Manahle said. But that would take a significant amount of time, he said, and would likely be an expensive legal battle.

“Most of our clients are not considering fighting with a mandamus action (the court order that would force the review) and are just waiting and hoping this will resume,” Manahle said.

Olins said she and other service providers have received little communication from the local field office for USCIS. Quarterly stakeholder meetings to discuss nitty-gritty policy manual updates have also been canceled.

The office of Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Seattle) has sent a formal inquiry to the Department of Homeland Security over the cancellations, a spokesperson said Wednesday.

She and other lawmakers sent a letter to the federal department last month to gain more information about the indefinite pause and vetting of immigrants from countries under travel restrictions.

In Washington, about 23,500 people became naturalized during federal fiscal year 2024. A federal study in 2023 estimated the state had about 190,000 green card holders eligible for naturalization.

She stressed the importance for advocates to connect immigrant parents who don’t have those networks with people who they can build trust with.
“These agreements are critically important for immigrant parents to ensure the best possible care for their children,” Setty said.
Mayra said she trusts Elizabeth — who has previously taken the children to Guatemala to visit their family members there — completely.
Mayra and Elizabeth have both spoken about preparing her children to be independent in case they’re separated from their mother.","For weeks after hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents were deployed to New Orleans as part of the Catahoula Crunch immigration crackdown, one Metairie woman and her husband — both of them undocumented immigrants from Honduras — lived in isolation, barely leaving the house.

Each time they leave, the woman said, they risk arrest, detention and deportation. She asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by immigration enforcement agents. (Verite News previously interviewed the woman in August.) Her husband, a construction worker, stopped going to work entirely for the first few weeks of December, after the beginning of the U.S. Border Patrol surge in New Orleans.

Despite the risk, he has since returned to work, she said, because they need the money.

“He needs to go out and work, we have rent to pay,” she said in a message on WhatsApp in December.

“My husband works alone when he is sure that there is not much movement on the streets,” another message, sent in January, said.

The couple worry about what would happen to their child — a 4-year old U.S. citizen — if they do get picked up. So they devised a backup plan — a notarized letter that names a close friend they trust as a temporary guardian for their son, also called “provisional custody by mandate.” The letter, which was drafted in March, authorizes the friend to take the child to and from school, to take him to his medical appointments and, if necessary, to travel with him out of the country.

“Having this Plan B gives me peace of mind, knowing that no matter what happens my child will be protected and cared for,” the mother told Verite News. “This decision was made with my child’s safety and stability in mind.”

As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, a growing number of immigrant parents — even some with legal status in the U.S. — across the New Orleans metro region are making such provisions to protect their children’s well-being, immigrant rights groups told Verite News.

There is no publicly available data to show how many temporary guardianship arrangements have been created in Louisiana since Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration or since the “Catahoula Crunch” operation began in December because these mandates are private legal documents, not court orders. But representatives from local organizations that support Latino and immigrant communities, including Puentes New Orleans and Familias Unidas en Accion said they have seen a sharp increase in families requesting help with making provisional custody arrangements.

Leticia Casildo, executive director of Familias Unidas, said before 2025, her organization encouraged undocumented parents to create guardianship arrangements for their children should they ever be detained, but back then, the group had few takers.

“Maybe we would have 10 people sign up in one year,” Casildo said.

Last year, however, Casildo said more than 200 families requested help to arrange for temporary guardianship. Since Catahoula Crunch launched, Casildo said, Familias Unidas has been arranging for volunteer notaries to visit peoples’ homes to assist with getting these legal documents signed because many are afraid to leave their residences.

Suma Setty, a senior analyst of policies affecting immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy, said her organization has received a “huge increase” in inquiries about temporary guardianship from local advocates and child care providers.

“The reason why these are becoming more popular is because parents are terrified” of what could happen if an arrangement is not in place, Setty told Verite News in a phone interview Thursday.

In April, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deported two mothers from Honduras, and their U.S. citizen children, after they were taken into custody at routine check-ins with operators of the agency’s immigrant surveillance program. A lawsuit filed in August on behalf of both families alleged that the mothers were not given the opportunity to arrange care for their U.S. citizen children, including one boy who was in treatment for stage 4 cancer.

In July, ICE issued a policy directive instructing officials to designate a “detained parent coordinator” and to “facilitate required participation in family court, child welfare, or guardianship proceedings, and communication with child welfare services” when parents or legal guardians of minors or incapacitated adult dependents are detained. ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.

The Center for Law and Social Policy interviewed undocumented immigrant parents in six states last year. Setty said the parents who already had agreements in place were people with large social networks that included adults with legal status in the U.S. who they trusted. She stressed the importance for advocates to connect immigrant parents who don’t have those networks with people who they can build trust with.

Although temporary guardianship agreements vary from state to state, Setty said they generally allow for another adult to make decisions about children’s education, medical care and sometimes finances, while they are separated from their parents.

“These agreements are critically important for immigrant parents to ensure the best possible care for their children,” Setty said.

Arthur Ago, director of strategic litigation and advocacy at the Southern Poverty Law Center, who focuses on education and youth policy, acknowledged that such arrangements are often the best way to guarantee a child’s security when a parent is taken into immigration custody, he wishes that parents were not being forced to make them. Sudden changes in a child’s family structure have long-lasting negative consequences, he said.

“You are going to end up with children that could potentially be socially isolated within that new guardian unit, let alone if they have to move school districts,” Ago said. “That isolation destroys any sense of security and hope for children. … And that is going to set them back years.”

Originally from Guatemala, Mayra, a New Orleans mother of three with work authorization in the U.S., said she worries about how the “persecution” of immigrants is affecting her three children. Her two daughters are glued to the social media accounts of local immigrants rights activists, watching to see where Border Patrol and ICE agents are showing up next. Whenever there are alerts that agents are in their community, her kids beg her not to go outside, she said. And when she goes to work as a cleaner, they inundate her with phone calls to make sure she’s safe and will return home.

“I think the fear that they feel is more than I feel,” Mayra, who asked Verite News to use her first name only because she fears being targeted by immigration enforcement, said in Spanish, speaking through an interpreter. “After all this [is over] I don’t think they’re gonna be the same.”

When the Border Patrol operation began in New Orleans Mayra sat her daughters — ages 10 and 13 — and her 18-year-old son down to tell them the plan she’d come up with if she were to be detained. The conversation was difficult, she said. When she told her son he’d have to sell her car to make sure they had enough money to get by without her, at least for a while, the children burst into tears.

But the first thing they’d have to do, she said, was call Elizabeth, a social worker they’d known since her youngest daughter was a baby. Elizabeth had agreed to take care of the kids if Mayra were to get picked up.

Mayra didn’t make a formal arrangement with Elizabeth. Since her eldest son is 18, he would be able to maintain legal guardianship of his younger siblings. And with his permission, Elizabeth, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, would do the actual work of taking care of them.

Mayra said she trusts Elizabeth — who has previously taken the children to Guatemala to visit their family members there — completely.

Mayra and Elizabeth have both spoken about preparing her children to be independent in case they’re separated from their mother.

“It’s out of necessity, they need to be able to survive without [her],” Elizabeth, who said she is honored that Mayra asked her to watch over her children, said. “[It’s] deeply sad for the orientation for your kids to have to shift in that way.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250818_CZB_Immigration_02-2000x1334-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:57:49.395060

And Venezuelans living in the United States continue to feel the whiplash.

Over the past five years, Venezuelans fleeing political persecution or economic chaos may have been invited to temporarily live in the U.S.; granted short-term permission to work and stay; been stripped of protections and work permits with barely any notice; and/or been subjected to swift and sudden moves to deport them. Many of them have experienced all four.

The Venezuelan refugee crisis has coincided with an American approach to asylum and border security that focuses on deterrence: stopping people from crossing into the U.S. and making asylum claims. Both Democratic and Republican presidents have put deterrence first, but the policies they’ve put in place — not to mention the rhetoric they use to justify those policies — have differed. As a result, Venezuelans living in the U.S. have been knocked back and forth between policy regimes, unable to plan the rest of their lives. And the rest of the world — including Venezuelans who might consider trying to come to the U.S. — has received an incoherent, and ultimately untrustworthy, mishmash of messages about the U.S.’ approach to immigration, democracy, and the rule of law.

Let’s look at some hypothetical examples.

Imagine a political dissident who fled the Maduro regime because he was worried about retribution for organizing student protests. In 2023, he arrived in Mexico and waited several months for an appointment to present himself for asylum at a port of entry in El Paso, by registering with the CBP One app. (We actually met just such a person during a trip the American Immigration Council took to El Paso/Ciudad Juarez in fall 2023.) When his appointment date finally came up, he was given a court date for January 2025 to present his asylum claim and permission to apply for a work permit that would allow him to survive in the U.S. in the meantime. He has spent several months pulling together an application demonstrating that he has been persecuted on the basis of his pro-democracy political opinions — a straightforward type of asylum claim that falls squarely within the “protected grounds” laid out in the 1980 Refugee Act and the international Refugee Convention.

But in early 2025, our hypothetical dissident got a letter telling him his work permit was summarily canceled — and right before his court date, the U.S. has filed a motion saying that the judge shouldn’t consider his asylum claim at all, and should instead send him to Honduras under a “third country” deportation agreement. (This is particularly ironic because while Nicolas Maduro is being accused of narcoterrorism for trafficking cocaine, the former president of Honduras has been pardoned by the United States on cocaine-trafficking charges.) What is this person supposed to believe about the U.S.’ commitment to democracy and the rule of law? What is he supposed to do?

Alternatively, imagine someone who was paroled into the United States in fall 2022, when the Biden administration launched a parole program to allow some Venezuelans into the U.S. on two-year work permits (a program later expanded to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans). In 2023, the Biden administration determined that Venezuela was too unstable to safely deport people back to, and so redesignated Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status.

This person, who had applied twice for forms of legal protection in the United States, spent 2025 having those protections stripped from her: the Trump administration moved to terminate both the parole program and the TPS designations. While both moves have been challenged in federal court, the Supreme Court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to move forward with implementation hile the courts decide whether the law allows them to do so.

Today, the United States claims that the country that was supposedly safe enough to deport her to last year was actually being run by a dangerous narcoterrorist. However, now that the president has been removed and the current government of the country is in flux, the U.S. claims it’s still entirely safe for her to return. What should she believe awaits her if she is deported back home?

If I were in either of these situations — and we’re not even talking about the hundreds of Venezuelan men who were tortured in El Salvador for months last year on the basis of flimsy evidence of gang affiliation, then sent back to a country run by a man who the U.S. now claims was a criminal himself — I would conclude that I’d been hoodwinked by the United States’ promise of the rule of law and an impartial immigration process. I’d conclude that there wasn’t any real immigration policy, simply a set of evolving feelings toward other governments, with the people living under those governments treated as pawns.

This might be true. But it’s certainly not the way the United States immigration system is supposed to work. This isn’t just a matter of starry-eyed commitment to liberal ideals: it’s impossible to run a functioning immigration system without consistency, because people need to know what to expect when they’re making decisions about where to move and when. Ironically, while governments of both parties have remained committed to “deterrence” as the top priority of border management over the last 20 years, their actions and rhetoric have made it impossible for them to achieve that aim — because deterrence requires being able to credibly predict, with certainty, what would happen to someone if they tried to come.

We don’t know who runs Venezuela right now, or will in the future. We don’t know who, if anyone, will come out of this on top. But we know it won’t be the Venezuelans who have spent the Maduro regime being buffeted by governments throughout the hemisphere for whom they’ve been an unwanted residue of geopolitical conflict.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-impact-maduro-venezuela.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:59:14.326714

Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Representatives Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25), Darren Soto (FL-9), and House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Gregory Meeks (NY-5) led 70 House Democrats in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem demanding they immediately restore Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans following the Trump Administration’s military action in Venezuela. The letter was signed by every Democratic Member of Congress from Florida. No Republicans signed the letter.

On Saturday, January 3, 2026, the Trump Administration conducted a major military operation in Venezuela, without Congressional authorization or notification, to depose and arrest Nicolás Maduro, leading to further instability in the nation. TPS is designed to protect immigrants from nations destabilized by war, violence, or natural disasters from deportation back to unsafe conditions.

“Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS…are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger—conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro,” the Members wrote. “Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.”

“While Maduro was captured and brought to the United States to face justice, his criminal accomplices remain in power,” wrote the Members. “We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado.”

The complete letter can be read here and below.

Dear Secretary Rubio and Secretary Noem:

We write to urge you to immediately restore Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans following the Trump Administration’s military action in Venezuela. Conditions in the country are deeply unstable and dangerous, and the still-intact Venezuelan regime, emboldened by support from the President of the United States, has doubled down on repression and brutality since taking power.

The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved. This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now. This termination of lawful status has caused unimaginable fear and anxiety for law-abiding Venezuelan families, who passed criminal background checks, earned work permits, and paid fees and taxes.

Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS are set to lose their employment authorization, which will have devastating economic consequences for essential sectors in Florida and across the country. Many are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger—conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro.

This administration has not just abandoned Venezuelans in the diaspora, they have abandoned the Venezuelans that remain in Venezuela, who yearn for freedom and a democratic transition. While Maduro was captured and brought to the United States to face justice, his criminal accomplices remain in power, including de facto interim president Delcy Rodriguez, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello (who was indicted alongside Maduro in 2019). We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado.

The worst fears of the Venezuelan community were confirmed as President Trump stated that Delcy Rodriguez will be empowered to “make Venezuela great again” and underscored that his objective was extracting oil resources from the country rather than ending the suffering of Venezuelans and promoting a peaceful, democratic transition of power.

In the days since the U.S. military operation commenced, which included missile and drone strikes in densely populated areas of Caracas that damaged residential buildings and injured innocent bystanders, the Venezuelan regime has enacted a new law criminalizing any expression of support for Maduro’s exit from the country. Dozens of people have been arrested and jailed, including journalists, for sending text messages or issuing social media posts related to the news. Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.

In light of these developments, we urge you to immediately rescind the revocation of TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries and extend these critical protections for law-abiding Venezuelans who are genuinely fearful of being sent back to the same murderous regime under new management.

Media Miss by the right: At least five people have been killed in immigration crackdowns

Wednesday’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer-involved shooting marks at least the fifth person killed during immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration.

Renee Good, 37, was killed while driving her SUV through an ICE scene. Administration officials and President Trump say the shooting was an act of self-defense.

Other recent cases include a person shot and killed in Chicago in September, two people who died after being struck by vehicles while fleeing from immigration officers during separate incidents in August and October, and a California farmworker who fatally fell from a greenhouse during an ICE raid in July.

Media Miss by the left: GOP Republican moves to honor Nick Shirley with Congressional Gold Medal

Rep. Eli Crane, R-Az., is pushing to award a YouTuber who deems himself an “independent journalist” the Congressional Gold Medal. It’s the highest honor Congress can bestow upon a civilian.

Nick Shirley, well known in MAGA circles, posted a video exposing alleged daycare fraud in Minnesota that went viral and sparked federal government probes into Minnesota’s social service programs. To date, many of the accusations raised in the video have either been debunked or left unsubstantiated.

What we know:

The protests follow the Wednesday, Jan. 7 death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Video of the encounter has fueled national outrage, though Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent’s actions, stating the agent fired in self-defense after Good allegedly attempted to ram them with a vehicle.

Speaking on the House floor Thursday, Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., called for an independent probe into the Department of Homeland Security.

""A woman is dead. A child has been left without a parent,"" Ansari said. ""What happened to Renee Good demands a full, independent and immediate investigation.""

Outside the Phoenix ICE headquarters on Central Avenue, crowds fluctuated throughout the afternoon. Protesters expressed anger over the death of Good, who was identified by demonstrators as a U.S. citizen.

""A U.S. citizen was killed yesterday in Minneapolis,"" one protester said. ""That’s why there should be more people out on the streets.""

Local perspective:

The unrest comes amid fears that similar enforcement operations could occur in the Valley. When asked if raids were planned for the Phoenix area, an ICE field office spokesperson told FOX 10 the agency ""does not discuss any alleged ongoing, upcoming or planned immigration enforcement operations"" due to operational security.

Vigil held in Mesa

Mourners gathered in Mesa on Thursday night for an emotional vigil following a string of fatal and violent encounters involving federal agents. The event focused largely on the death of Renee Nicole Good, who was killed Wednesday during an ICE enforcement action in Minneapolis.

The Mesa gathering was one of several vigils held nationwide as news broke of another shooting involving U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in Portland, Oregon.

""Let’s now hold one moment of silence for Renee Nicole Good,"" one attendee said. ""A mother, a daughter, an innocent American civilian.""

Participants lit candles and held signs as speakers expressed fear and anger over the escalating tension between federal law enforcement and the public. One mother at the vigil described the situation as ""abhorrent,"" adding that she was shaken by the thought of children losing a parent to ""something so senseless.""

While Homeland Security officials have maintained that the Minnesota shooting was an act of self-defense, many at the Mesa vigil rejected that claim.

""We need to be clear about the situation,"" a protester said. ""This was not self-defense; this was murder.""

The wave of communal loss has sparked a broader civic outcry, with demonstrators warning that the divide in the United States is becoming more pronounced.

""This affects all of us,"" one attendee said. ""And it will get worse if we allow it to continue.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox10phoenix.com/www.fox10phoenix.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/video-5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-09 14:12:39.259294

Long travel times and limited space for in-person meetings often result in attorneys and their clients using confidential legal mail to review evidence, prepare filings, and make informed decisions about their cases.

NEW YORK, NY – Today, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York (PLS), the Robert & Ethel Kennedy Human Rights Center, and Covington & Burling LLC announced a settlement in PLS v. DHS that ensures all privileged legal mail sent to immigrants detained in the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility (commonly known as Batavia) remains secure and confidential.

“This settlement rightly affirms the First Amendment’s guarantee that lawyers and their clients have a right to confidentially communicate, without fear the government is listening,” said Amy Belsher, Director of Immigrants’ Rights Litigation at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “People trapped immigration detention, and lawyers like us, rely on written communications to relay deeply personal information about immigration cases and can be the difference between whether someone returns home to their family or faces deportation. As the Trump administration keeps arresting immigrant New Yorkers en masse and forces more people into these deplorable detention facilities, it’s essential that people’s First Amendment rights are respected and upheld.”

With this settlement, Batavia’s previous mail policy will immediately cease, and ICE officers will no longer be permitted to open privileged legal mail. Now, officials must distribute people’s legal mail within 24 hours of receipt, use a specific, secure device to scan all incoming mail, and cannot copy, retain, or open anyone’s legal mail without the intended recipient present. To ensure compliance, the settlement also gives the court continued jurisdiction to address any violations.

“This victory in PLS v. DHS affirms a fundamental principle of justice: confidential legal mail is not a privilege; it is a right,” said Karen Murtagh, Executive Director of Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York. “For immigrants detained in remote immigration facilities, such as the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, secure legal mail is frequently the only reliable way for clients and their attorneys to communicate. Long travel times and limited space for in-person meetings often result in attorneys and their clients using confidential legal mail to review evidence, prepare filings, and make informed decisions about their cases. Any breach of legal mail confidentiality threatens the fairness of the legal process itself. Ensuring that privileged legal mail remains secure and confidential is essential to effective representation and to upholding the integrity of our justice system.”

The organizations originally filed this lawsuit in March 2025, after Batavia officials abruptly changed the facility’s mail policy to give ICE officers permission to open people’s privileged legal mail.

“Legal mail is a lifeline for detained people,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at the Robert & Ethel Kennedy Human Rights Center. “In facilities like Batavia that are notorious for abuse, confidential communication with attorneys is one of the only ways immigrants can get help for cruel and degrading treatment. Without a safe way to sound the alarm, detained people are left at the mercy of a broken and inhumane system.”

This litigation over Batavia’s mail policy follows a broader and longstanding pattern of abuse at the facility. For years, officials at Batavia have subjected people in detention to cruel, inhumane treatment, including the use of excessive force, rampant overcrowding, and prolonged solitary confinement. During the first Trump administration, the NYCLU sued Batavia and federal officials, successfully securing asylum seekers’ right to a parole process, reinstating fair legal hearings, and mandating protective measures for those at risk during the COVID pandemic.",https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/batavia2-e1762378698830-1024x512.jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 15:58:16.420227

The states — California, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois and New York — called the move an unconstitutional abuse of power. The Trump administration announced earlier this week it was withholding their social safety net funding.

The funding went toward three federal programs, two of which focus on lifting families with children out of poverty.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the lawsuit, said the Trump administration is overstepping its authority by freezing billions of dollars in funds that were already approved for the states by Congress.

The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York asks the courts to order the administration to halt the freeze and release the funds.

""Once again, the most vulnerable families in our communities are bearing the brunt of this administration's campaign of chaos and retribution,"" James said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week told the five states it was freezing their money for the Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes child care for children from low-income families; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance and job training; and the Social Services Block Grant.

HHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

About half of the $10 billion in funding targeted by the Trump administration supported California programs, said the state's attorney general, Rob Bonta.

In letters to the states, Alex J. Adams, assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, wrote that HHS had ""reason to believe"" the states were providing benefits to people who were in the U.S. illegally, offering no further details about the allegations. They requested reams of data, including the names and Social Security numbers of everyone that had received some of the benefits.

""The letters requested that California turn over essentially every document ever associated with the state's implementation of these federal programs and do so within 14 days, by Jan. 20, including personally identifiable information about program participants,"" Bonta said. ""That is deeply concerning and also deeply frustrating.""

The government intensified its focus on the child care subsidy program after a conservative YouTuber released a video claiming day care centers in Minneapolis had committed up to $100 million in fraud. The child care centers were run by members of the city's Somali community, which has been frequently maligned by Trump and targeted by immigration authorities.

“That’s why I like Columbus, Ohio — we’re all together.”","COLUMBUS, Ohio — Anti-ICE protests continued Thursday across central Ohio following the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis, prompting demonstrations from suburban Westerville to the Ohio Statehouse.

RELATED: Columbus protesters rally after fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis

In Westerville, more than 100 people lined South State Street outside city hall during a “rush hour rally,” organized by the Westerville Progressive Alliance, holding signs and drawing honks of support from passing drivers.

“We would like to see ICE out of our city, out of our state, out of our country. It’s really not OK,” said Kimi Dodds, who attended the rally.

Dodds said the demonstration was about speaking up against federal immigration enforcement practices.

“We have to stand up for what’s right in our heart,” she said. ""There's a feeling of unity, where people just want to have a strong bond for standing up for what they believe in and showing others, the passersby that are beeping and cheering, too.""

Among those attending was John Schmarr, 74, who said the protest echoed movements he participated in decades ago.

“My first protest was 1970 — that little thing called the Vietnam War,” Schmarr said. “That I’m out here today just shows that our government, our society keeps coming back and doing things they shouldn’t be doing.”

As evening fell, a second night of demonstrations unfolded outside the Ohio Statehouse, where a growing crowd gathered, chanting the shooting victim's name, Renee Nicole Good.

Earlier Thursday, Ohio native and Vice President JD Vance said from the White House that the agent acted lawfully.

“That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job,” Vance said. “The idea that Tim Walz and a bunch of radicals in Minneapolis are going to go after and make this guy’s life miserable because he was doing the job that he was asked to do is preposterous.”

Despite that response, several hundred people took their message to the streets, marching and chanting through downtown Columbus.

“O-H … ICE out! O-H … ICE out!” they shouted.

Columbus police officers, including members of the department’s Dialogue Team wearing blue vests, were visible Thursday monitoring the events.

Mayor Andrew Ginther, in a statement Thursday afternoon, said the police’s Dialogue Team would be deployed where needed to support peaceful demonstrations and public safety.

“Minneapolis is a city that has turned pain into purpose — and used it to change the country — before, and I pray for the families involved and for Minneapolis’ leaders and residents,” Ginther said in a statement. “Here in Columbus, we cannot let this injustice intensify our divisions. I ask our residents to express their hurt and frustrations peacefully.”

After the march through downtown, organizers shared they were also tracking reports of another ICE-involved shooting in Portland, evoking groans from those gathered.

“As we were mobilizing to fight back against ICE, DHS…” said Deja Gaston, an organizer, referencing ongoing developments. “Right now, we’re witnessing, again, another instance of brutality that is state sanctioned.""

Attendees said the violence feels personal.

“If that happened over there, it can happen here,” said Daysi, who attended the protest. “It’s just really scary.""

Another attendee, Brianna, said the impact on families weighed heavily on her.

“It’s just sad, seeing kids without their parents,"" she said. ""It’s just unimaginable.""

Even so, protesters said the turnout itself reflected unity across communities.

“No matter if you’re Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, we’re all together,” said attendee Christina McDaniel. “That’s why I like Columbus, Ohio — we’re all together.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WBNS/images/d256827e-ce7e-4628-8579-f64591f43e80/20260109T031847/d256827e-ce7e-4628-8579-f64591f43e80_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 14:12:44.709348

""What I observed is the woman is trying to turn right and not trying to hit an officer,"" he said. ""It is completely irresponsible to say this was a domestic terrorist.

Gen. Rob Bonta announced Thursday.

The lawsuit was filed jointly by the five states targeted by the freeze — California, New York, Minnesota, Illinois and Colorado — over the Trump administration’s allegations of widespread fraud within their welfare systems. California alone is facing a loss of about $5 billion in funding, including $1.4 billion for child-care programs.

The lawsuit alleges that the freeze is based on unfounded claims of fraud and infringes on Congress’ spending power as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“This is just the latest example of Trump’s willingness to throw vulnerable children, vulnerable families and seniors under the bus if he thinks it will advance his vendetta against California and Democratic-led states,” Bonta said at a Thursday evening news conference.

The $10-billion funding freeze follows the administration’s decision to freeze $185 million in child-care funds to Minnesota, where federal officials allege that as much as half of the roughly $18 billion paid to 14 state-run programs since 2018 may have been fraudulent. Amid the fallout, Gov. Tim Walz has ordered a third-party audit and announced that he will not seek a third term.

Bonta said that letters sent by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announcing the freeze Tuesday provided no evidence to back up claims of widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in California. The freeze applies to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the Social Services Block Grant program and the Child Care and Development Fund.

“This is funding that California parents count on to get the safe and reliable child care they need so that they can go to work and provide for their families,” he said. “It’s funding that helps families on the brink of homelessness keep roofs over their heads.”

Bonta also raised concerns regarding Health and Human Services’ request that California turn over all documents associated with the state’s implementation of the three programs. This requires the state to share personally identifiable information about program participants, a move Bonta called “deeply concerning and also deeply questionable.”

“The administration doesn’t have the authority to override the established, lawful process our states have already gone through to submit plans and receive approval for these funds,” Bonta said. “It doesn’t have the authority to override the U.S. Constitution and trample Congress’ power of the purse.”

Yesterday's deadly shooting in Minneapolis is raising questions about the use of force by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her vehicle while the agency was conducting an immigration enforcement operation in the city. She is not the first person killed by immigration agents over the past year of the Trump administration. NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán joins us now to tell us more. Hi there.

SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hey.

SUMMERS: Sergio, what have you learned about what happened in Minneapolis?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah, we know there's an ongoing federal investigation and we know a bit more about what happened yesterday, Juana. So Vice President JD Vance says immigration agents were conducting an enforcement operation going door to door to find undocumented immigrants, which is unusual. And there are still conflicting interpretations of what happened or who is to blame. But the FBI took over the investigation, pushing out the state agency in charge of investigating these types of incidents.

SUMMERS: And that detail seems significant here - of the FBI taking over. What makes this case stand out?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, multiple things, but I think the big one is that the person shot and killed in this case - Renee Good - was a U.S. citizen who was not the subject of any law enforcement investigation. There's also a lot of video evidence of this incident, yet there are important details that we don't know yet. For instance, videos show Good's car was perpendicular in the street. DHS says she was impeding agents. But a witness told NPR Good was there as a legal observer, although Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was not an observer nor a protester. But we do know that there were protesters in the street.

SUMMERS: And we have seen ICE agents in the past engage with protesters besides arresting immigrants. Has that been their role in the past?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: ICE agents are not trained to do crowd control. That is not their role. Here's John Sandweg, who served as ICE's acting director during the Obama administration.

JOHN SANDWEG: The way in which this administration is deploying the agents, the way in which - you know, and especially with tasking the agents with being, you know, the front line on the crowd control, you know, you're creating a toxic stew there.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: He says this shows how Trump's deployment of ICE puts both the public and the agents at risk.

SUMMERS: And as we mentioned, Renee Good is not the first person to be involved in a violent incident during the Trump administration, right?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Right. Look, Juana, it's no secret the Trump administration has pushed for an aggressive crackdown on immigration - legal and illegal. And you're right, we've seen shootings by ICE agents. In fact, The Trace - a nonprofit newsroom that focuses on gun violence - has identified at least 14 shootings in ICE raids since January of last year.

Now, NPR hasn't independently confirmed all of these shootings, but we've reported on some of them. Chicago has seen some of the most high-profile shootings. Last year, a Mexican immigrant was killed after attempting to drive away from immigration agents. Also last year in Chicago, agents fired at a woman while she was still in her car, injuring her. Here's Sandweg, the former acting ICE director, again.

SANDWEG: Remember, ICE has been in operation for almost 20 years now - a little over 20 years, I think, right? And during that time, they've made millions of arrests. And we really haven't seen anything in those 20 years like we've been seeing with this administration. And it's a direct by-product of this kind of - these shifting tactics that we saw, you know, really beginning in March, where the administration started, you know, promoting and these surges of agents and for these very flashy, high-profile operations in cities.

SUMMERS: Sergio, seems like the Trump administration's response to yesterday's fatal shooting in Minneapolis is just one piece of a bigger picture.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Right. The Trump administration hasn't shied away from promoting its operations in cities across the country. And they're fiercely defending the agent that was accused of shooting Renee Good and have vowed to continue their immigration crackdown as well.

SUMMERS: NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, thanks.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome.

The data was gathered by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR).

SEE ALSO | Seattle groups join national protest against ICE raids following Minneapolis shooting

The nine cases in the report were Washington drivers who were subjected to immigration enforcement while driving, following a search of their license plate number in the Washington Department of Licensing (DOL)’s database by federal agents. These agents used a national data-sharing platform called Nlets, made possible through the Washington State Patrol (WSP)’s ACCESS platform, according to UWCHR.

""In at least seven of these cases, UWCHR researchers were able to confirm that the arrests were acts of civil immigration enforcement,"" the UWCHR report said.

""While state authorities now claim to have curtailed access by one of ICE’s sub-agencies to DOL data via ACCESS, in eight of the nine confirmed cases discussed in this report, it was CBP, not ICE, who conducted the query. There is therefore no reason to believe that this process does not continue to date,"" the report continued.

DOL and WSP jointly submitted feedback in response to the draft report, shared with the Governor’s Office last Friday, according to the statement.

""ICE access to Nlets was shut off on November 19,"" the joint statement said.

The Governor’s Office directed WSP and DOL to shut off ICE’s access to DOL data through Nlets as early as Nov 7, 2025, the statement further claimed.

However, it took longer than anticipated for WSP’s data vendor to implement that change, and ICE’s access to Nlets was finally blocked on the morning of Nov. 19.

WSP confirmed that since shutting off ICE access to DOL data through Nlets, thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied.

TIMELINE OF IMMIGRATION ARRESTS, CASES IN THE REPORT

The first of the nine confirmed cases the report covers occurred on Aug. 22, 2025.

ICE records show that ICE ERO, ICE HSI, and USBP officers went to a residential address in Edmonds to look for a person they believed to be undocumented.

In the second case, the arrest occurred on Sept. 20, 2025. ICE records show that agents observed a truck and, according to the documents, “Seattle ERO conducted a registration query on a 2103 Ford F-150 with Washington license plate number XXXXXXX.""

In the fourth documented case, the arrest occurred on Oct 4, 2025. ICE records state that an arrest team located a vehicle, and agents conducted a registration query using the car’s license plate, obtaining the registered owner’s name.

The last arrest was reported on Nov. 16, 2025. A Washington resident was in Gresham, Oregon, for work, and had just left a Latino grocery store when ICE officers spotted him.

From Jan. 1, 2025, to Nov. 30, 2025, federal agencies used ACCESS/Nlets to query WA DOL data a total of 2,671,776 times, according to data provided by DOL to UWCHR.

The number represents the use of Washington resources to conduct civil immigration enforcement; the figure includes the verification of documents at U.S.-Canadian border crossings and many other lawful purposes, the report said.

The cases verified by UWCHR researchers likely form part of a much broader pattern of federal agents tapping into WA DOL data to target Washingtonians for arrest for civil immigration violations.

COMMUNITY CONCERNS

The sharing platform, called Nlets, is different than Flock camera systems.

""It's not Flock focused, but it's looking at the data sharing system Nlets and ongoing WA Dept of Licensing - ICE/CBP data sharing, allowing federal immigration enforcement to obtain WA driver data to assist them in immigration arrests,"" a UWCHR researcher said.

Due to increased community concerns about data collection, access, and privacy protections, several cities across western Washington decided to deactivate their FLOCK cameras late last year.

In October 2025, the City of Auburn announced that any agency found using Auburn's Flock data for immigration enforcement will have its access permanently revoked.

""The types of enforcement we have seen in recent months—warrantless arrests by unidentified masked men driving unmarked vehicles, sometimes accompanied by acts of shocking violence—threaten the civil liberties of all Washingtonians,"" the report said in its recommendations to the state.

“There must be accountability to the fullest extent of the law for this shooting,” Hughes said.","Wisconsin Democrats are denouncing the Wednesday shooting death of a Minnesota woman by federal immigration agents, with some calling for ICE to be dismantled.

Meanwhile, Wisconsin Republicans are standing by law enforcement, accusing the woman of engaging in “domestic terrorism” and hinting that Democrats are inciting people to break the law.

Widely distributed videos show an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent draw his gun and shoot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her SUV. Good attempted to drive forward on a Minneapolis road as another officer demanded she exit her vehicle.

President Donald Trump and members of his administration said the agent who killed Good was acting in self defense. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have disputed that Wednesday, with Frey telling ICE to “get the f— out of the city.”

During a Thursday appearance on WPR’s “Wisconsin Today,” Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson called it a “tragedy all the way around” and said he’d like to see elected officials “stop inciting people to impede lawful operations.”

“Don’t obstruct justice,” said Johnson. “Don’t put yourself at risk. And again, this is a tragedy all the way around. It didn’t have to happen. Pretty common for these protesters to use vehicles to ram ICE agents. ICE agents have been put at risk.”

In a social media post, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin called for an investigation into the shooting death.

“But this we do know: Trump is sending in masked agents into our neighborhoods, is causing chaos, and is not making our communities any safer,” said Baldwin.

During a Wednesday interview with Stephen A. Smith, U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Prairie du Chien, said he’s not going to second-guess anything until there’s a thorough investigation of what happened.

“But it sure as heck looks like this is an act of domestic terrorism by this woman trying to run over a federal agent, and he was acting out of self defense,” said Van Orden.

U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, posted on social media that “Donald Trump’s ICE just murdered a woman in cold blood” and suggested that if the agent who shot Good isn’t arrested and tried, the Department of Homeland Security “is a rogue agency lacking appropriate training and leadership.”

Democrats, Republicans running for governor weigh in

Wisconsin’s field of candidates running to replace outgoing Gov. Tony Evers also had a lot to say about who they thought was to blame for the Good’s death in Minneapolis.

On Thursday afternoon, Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany sent a statement to WPR stating that “when a law enforcement officer repeatedly instructs someone to exit a vehicle and that person instead ignores the command and accelerates toward an officer, those choices can carry unfortunate consequences.”

“I respect the ongoing investigation into this tragic death and remain committed to restoring respect for the rule of law and supporting the men and women who enforce it,” said Tiffany.

Former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes posted that “Trump said he would deport criminals, instead Americans are being killed.”

“Nothing about sending masked agents into our streets without accountability is making us safer,” said Barnes. “My heart is with Minnesota today and the victim’s family. This should have never happened.”

In a social media video, Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, a Republican, criticized the comments about ICE agents from Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was a vice presidential candidate the 2024 election.

“The statements from the mayor, the statements from the governor, are ridiculous,” Schoemann said. “Let ICE do their work. We need to support law enforcement 100 percent.”

Wisconsin state Rep. Francesca Hong, D-Madison, called Wednesday’s shooting “a dark day in America” on social media and shared a fundraising link for Good’s family.

“No one should live in fear of their government murdering its own people when neighbors are trying to protect one another,” Hong said.

In a subsequent post, Hong said “dismantling ICE is the bare minimum” and “removing enforcers of fascism is not enough.”

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a written statement his “heart is with Renee Nicole Good and all who loved her.”

“When executive power is exercised without restraint, and when accountability is treated as hostility, we are no longer talking about public safety,” said Crowley. “We are talking about fear.”

Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, who is also running for governor as a Democrat, said in a Wednesday post that she is “heartbroken” by Good’s killing by an ICE agent.

“There must be accountability to the fullest extent of the law for this shooting,” Hughes said. “We can do two things at once — uphold the law and protect human life.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26008837420596-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:59:16.920214

Multiple states established a grace period of several weeks after Election Day, far longer than Mississippi’s modern law allows.
In passing that law, Congress chose not to mandate same-day receipt of ballots.
Federal law sets the day by which votes must be cast, not the day by which they must be received.","Mississippi law, like the law of many states, provides that as long as ballots are completed and mailed by Election Day, they should be counted if they are received shortly afterward. This ensures that absentee voters have the same deadline to vote as in-person voters, without being penalized because of delays in the mail. The Republican National Committee challenged Mississippi’s law, claiming that it violated the federal laws setting the date for elections for federal office. Though the district court upheld the law, the Fifth Circuit reversed. According to the Fifth Circuit, an “election” under federal law encompasses both the casting of votes and their receipt by officials—meaning ballots must be received by Election Day. Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, and it agreed to do so.

CAC filed an amicus brief explaining why the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation is wrong and Mississippi’s law is lawful. Our amicus brief makes two principal points.

First, the text and history of the federal election laws establish that “election day” is the deadline for casting ballots—not for receiving them. The laws setting out the timing of federal elections follow in the tradition of the Constitution, which makes clear that when Congress sets an election day, it is setting only the date by which voters must indicate their choice of candidate. Article II of the Constitution provides that “Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors.” Congress sets the time of choosing, not the time of receiving, counting, or certifying those choices. Throughout the Constitution, “elections” are consistently treated as synonymous with “chusing”: Representatives are “chosen . . . by the People,” and when the House of Representatives selects a President, it “shall choose . . . by ballot.” And Founding-era dictionaries uniformly defined “election” as the act of choosing—not the receipt of choices by officials. The Supreme Court has confirmed this understanding, holding in United States v. Classic that an election occurs when voters express their choice of candidates.

Second, historical practice reinforces this reading. During the Civil War, when absentee voting first emerged at scale, states across the Union and Confederacy enacted soldier-voting laws that expressly contemplated ballots being received after Election Day. Multiple states established a grace period of several weeks after Election Day, far longer than Mississippi’s modern law allows. States passed laws directing that election judges delay counting ballots for several weeks to allow for soldiers’ ballots to be received. Congress enacted the first federal statute establishing a uniform day for congressional elections—just seven years after the Civil War ended—against the backdrop of these widespread state practices. In passing that law, Congress chose not to mandate same-day receipt of ballots.

The Fifth Circuit’s decision should be reversed. Federal law sets the day by which votes must be cast, not the day by which they must be received.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2026-01-09 11:11:56.342089

The consolidated case is now pending against Doximity in federal court in Massachusetts.","Key criminal law issues to watch this year include the continuing shift in state-level reforms. More states are expected to consider decriminalizing marijuana, as well as adopting “Death with Dignity” physician-assisted suicide laws, reflecting evolving public attitudes toward autonomy and harm reduction. Another major development is the Model Penal Code’s revised sexual assault provisions, which modernize consent standards but have yet to be adopted by any state—an implementation gap worth monitoring. Finally, the nationwide trend toward eliminating the death penalty continues to gain momentum, and the coming year will reveal whether additional states join the movement away from capital punishment.

In Cox v. Sony, the Supreme Court will decide the responsibility of an internet service provider (ISP) to police its users’ copyright infringement. A group of more than 50 music companies, including Sony, sued Cox, claiming it was indirectly liable for its users’ infringement of more than 10,000 works. It alleged that Cox received 160,000 notices of repeat copyright infringement on its network but loosened its copyright enforcement policies and terminated only 33 subscribers (in a period in which it cut off access to more than 600,000 for nonpayment). A jury found Cox liable for $1 billion (though the appellate court rejected one of the bases of liability, remanding for a recalculation of damages). In contrast, Cox claims that the internet connection it provides has many uses that have nothing to do with infringement. It also contends that the required “material contribution” to infringement requires more active behavior like encouragement of unlawful acts, not failing to terminate access. Cox also warns that being forced to terminate service could punish innocent users in households, coffee shops, hospitals, universities, and military barracks, resulting in widespread disruption to internet access. The Court’s conclusion will have vast consequences for ISPs, and thus all of us.

Ever since the Supreme Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the conventional wisdom has been that Congress can create so-called “independent agencies.” These agencies–like the FCC, SEC, FTC, and Federal Reserve–are often run by multimember boards or commissions with bipartisan membership and statutory protection from at-will firing by the President. Since the start of his second term, however, President Trump has taken the position that these statutory removal restrictions are unlawful because they interfere with his constitutional authority over the executive branch. On that view, he fired Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission. Her fight for reinstatement has now arrived at the Supreme Court as Trump v. Slaughter, a case in which President Trump has asked the Court to overrule Humphrey’s Executor and to recognize a conclusive and preclusive presidential power to remove executive officers. But even if the Court upholds the legality of Slaughter's statutory removal protection, another question in the case is whether courts have any authority to order reinstatement–as opposed to some other remedy, like backpay–when an unlawful firing occurs. A final important factor lurking in the background of Slaughter's case is the Federal Reserve: If President Trump wins, can the Court craft a rule that does not result in political control over U.S. monetary policy, an outcome that could have important consequences for confidence in the U.S. economy?

Arguably one of the most important legal issues to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court this term is whether President Trump’s Executive Order 14160 (E.O. 14160), which seeks to redefine who may acquire U.S. citizenship by birth, violates the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are U.S. citizens. E.O. 14160, issued on January 20, 2025, the first day of President Trump's return to the White House, provides that persons who are born in the United States are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” if the parents are undocumented or in the country lawfully but present on a temporary basis. To acquire birthright citizenship under the executive order, at least one parent has to be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The Trump administration has faced multiple lawsuits from individuals, organizations, and states challenging the constitutionality and validity of the executive order. On December 5, 2025, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Trump v. Barbara, a case brought by parents on behalf of their U.S.-born children. The question presented is “whether the Executive Order complies on its face with the Citizenship Clause and with 8 U.S.C. 1401(a), which codifies that Clause.”

Many issues relating to LGBTQ+ rights are on the docket at the Supreme Court this year–with a particular focus on transgender rights. The Supreme Court has already ruled in Trump v. Orr (on the shadow docket) that a Trump Administration policy requiring all passports to reflect sex assigned at birth is likely constitutional, and can go into effect. This is a ruling that has profound negative effects for transgender Americans who have long been able to obtain passports that match their gender identity and presentation, and who face harassment, inconvenience, and risks to their safety when traveling with documentation that effectively outs them any time they are forced to provide it. In addition, the Court has three other major LGBTQ+ cases on its merits docket, including a First Amendment challenge to Colorado’s ban on conversion therapy (i.e., efforts to change LGBTQ+ status) for minors, and Equal Protection and Title IX challenges to state laws categorically banning trans women and girls from female athletics. However these cases are decided, they are likely to have a substantial doctrinal impact, both for LGBTQ+ rights, and for broader civil rights law.

OpenEvidence v. Doximity is one of the first cases to test whether strategic prompting of a generative AI model to learn how it was designed, developed, or fine-tuned constitutes trade secret misappropriation. The case follows an earlier lawsuit, OpenEvidence v. Pathway. OpenEvidence operates a widely used medical AI chatbot for clinicians. In early 2025, OpenEvidence sued Pathway Medical, alleging that Pathway conducted a “prompt injection attack” to induce the chatbot to reveal portions of its system prompt code. OpenEvidence characterizes this system prompt code as a core trade secret central to how the chatbot interacts with users. It later sued Doximity on similar grounds. Doximity then acquired Pathway Medical. The consolidated case is now pending against Doximity in federal court in Massachusetts. The litigation raises two central questions: whether system prompt code qualifies as a trade secret and whether strategic prompting is an improper means of acquisition or a lawful form of reverse engineering. Notably, the pleadings also show that defendants accessed the professional version of the chatbot using another person’s medical provider number, a form of misrepresentation unlikely to be excused under trade secret law. Moreover, the defendants’ conduct appears to have violated OpenEvidence’s Terms of Use, and many courts treat such violations as improper means under trade secret law.

Since 1984, the federal compassionate release statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), has formally allowed judges to reduce criminal sentences based on “extraordinary and compelling reasons.” But there wasn’t much legal activity on the issue until the First Step Act of 2018 allowed prisoners to file their own motions in federal court. Since then, almost 5,000 federal prisoners have won compassionate release, for reasons such as violence they were subjected to by Bureau of Prisons staff, as well as extreme disparities in their and their codefendants’ sentences. But federal prosecutors have sought—and some courts have imposed—limits on what types of circumstances judges may consider in compassionate release cases. In fall 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases—Fernandez v. United States and Rutherford v. United States—in which it could dramatically limit what federal judges are allowed to consider “extraordinary and compelling circumstances” when they consider prisoners’ motions. In the compassionate release statute, Congress listed just one limit on judges’ discretion to determine what circumstances are sufficiently extraordinary and compelling to grant compassionate release. Now, the Supreme Court will now decide whether to limit that discretion beyond what’s provided for in the statute, and its decision will have an impact on countless prisoners hoping for relief from their sentences.",https://law.rutgers.edu/themes/custom/rutgers_law/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-09 11:00:16.544667

The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.

""Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,"" an Avelo spokesperson said.

Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.

DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services.

Just before the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” abruptly wound down its Chicago area immigration enforcement campaign in November, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction that indefinitely restricts agents’ ability to use force, including riot control weapons like tear gas. But after the Chicago-based 7th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Ellis’ ruling two weeks later, plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case.

Read more: 7th Circuit stays judge’s order restricting immigration agents’ use of riot control weapons | Restrictions on federal immigration agents’ use of riot control weapons extended indefinitely

But during a hearing Thursday, Ellis expressed some skepticism about the wisdom of that maneuver. The judge cited Wednesday’s fatal shooting of motorist Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

“And it doesn’t give me much comfort in reading news reports that someone who — in some news reports, anyway — was described as a legal observer was shot yesterday in Minneapolis,” Ellis said. “So that is my concern.”

Video of the incident contradicts the Trump administration’s narrative that the shooting was justified because Good was boxing in agents with her car and attempting to use it as a weapon.

Wednesday’s shooting echoes the case of Miramar Martinez, which was overseen by Ellis’ colleague this fall. Martinez was also accused of having boxed in immigration agents with her car in an early October incident on Chicago’s South West side before a Border Patrol agent shot her five times. She was charged with assaulting federal immigration agents but Martinez denied allegations that she was a threat. By mid-November, the case fell apart and prosecutors asked that the charges be dismissed.

At several times over the course of litigation in the riot control weapons case this fall, Ellis noted her belief that the Trump administration, especially U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, had lied about the tenor of protests of immigration enforcement actions in order to justify using force against demonstrators.

Initially, Ellis had scheduled an early March trial in the case based on news reports that Bovino would return to the Chicago area in the early spring with a much larger contingent of agents, telling attorneys during a mid-November hearing that, “It would make sense that if it does ramp up again, everyone knows what the rules are.” But granting the plaintiffs’ motion for voluntary dismissal of the case would cancel the trial.

Ellis also cited Bovino’s brief return to Chicago in December and news reports this week that several dozen Border Patrol agents had returned to the area Tuesday night before she asked lawyers for the plaintiffs if they still want to move forward with dismissal.

After attorneys confirmed that was still the plan, the judge said that while she “certainly cannot force plaintiffs to litigate a case they don’t want to litigate,” she still has “an obligation to protect the interests of the class.” The complaint was filed as a class-action lawsuit and Ellis certified the class this fall.

“If I dismiss this case, the preliminary injunction ceases to exist,” she said. “Certainly, given my ruling, I believe that the evidence in this case justified the need for a preliminary injunction to govern the actions of the government when interacting with legal observers, journalists and protesters.”

Moving to dismiss the lawsuit will prevent the 7th Circuit or U.S. Supreme Court from giving the Trump administration any permanent expanded powers against civilians. Despite the specter of losses on appeal, plaintiffs’ lawyers have framed ending the case as a win.

Ellis asked for more time before making her final decision on dismissal, scheduling the next hearing for Jan. 22.

“You got to win the midterms,” Trump told House Republicans at a retreat Tuesday.
He hopes the specter of impeachment will bolster the determination of his party colleagues as they try to retain an extremely narrow House majority.
MAGA voters have helped Trump win the presidency in two of the three elections he has contested.
But there are other, more legally substantive matters that could become part of a future impeachment effort — even as Trump and his allies emphatically deny any wrongdoing.","A third impeachment of President Trump could be on the agenda if Democrats win control of Congress in November — and that’s according to the commander in chief himself.

“You got to win the midterms,” Trump told House Republicans at a retreat Tuesday. “If we don’t win the midterms … they’ll find a reason to impeach me. I’ll get impeached.”

Trump is, of course, making this argument for his own political reasons.

He hopes the specter of impeachment will bolster the determination of his party colleagues as they try to retain an extremely narrow House majority. He is also seeking to fire up the spirits of his Make America Great Again (MAGA) voters, who serve as a kind of electoral praetorian guard.

MAGA voters have helped Trump win the presidency in two of the three elections he has contested. But when his name is absent from the ballot, they do not always materialize for the GOP.

During Trump’s first term, Democrats netted 41 House seats in the 2018 midterms — despite the president urging his supporters to back his party.

Democrats need only a fraction of that number this year to retake the House. Right now, the GOP’s edge in the lower chamber is a mere five seats.

In any event, nobody doubts that Democratic control of the House after the midterms would at the very least make another effort to impeach Trump more likely.

He is already the only president in American history to have been impeached twice — first for an effort that was cast as him blocking congressionally-mandated U.S. aid to Ukraine to try to force Kyiv to investigate his political foes; and later for his conduct relating to the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.

There are already stirrings suggesting that Democrats will try again.

Rep. Al Green (R-Texas), a frequent wielder of the weapon of threatened impeachment, filed a new resolution in December. Green’s resolution proposes to impeach Trump as an “abuser of presidential power who, if left in office, will continue to promote violence.”

Specifically, Green was reacting to Trump’s implied suggestion last November that six Democratic lawmakers who had released a video encouraging troops to defy illegal orders should face the death penalty.

In a social media post, Trump had alleged that the six were guilty of “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”

There is, of course, no possibility at all of Green’s impeachment effort, or any similar push, gaining steam while Democrats remain in the minority in the House.

If the math changes when a new Congress is sworn in a year from now, it’s likely that the “seditious conspiracy” furor will be only the faintest of memories.

But there are other, more legally substantive matters that could become part of a future impeachment effort — even as Trump and his allies emphatically deny any wrongdoing.

The legality of the recent raid on Venezuela is disputed at home and abroad.

The actions of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have already drawn numerous civil lawsuits — and that was before the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday. It’s easy to imagine Democrats casting ICE’s actions as a broader pattern of illegality directed by Trump.

Questions also swirl around the legality of some of the sweeping cuts spearheaded by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; whether the president has used his regularity powers to enrich himself — as when a flimsy lawsuit centered on CBS’s “60 Minutes” was settled for $16 million as a merger awaited approval; whether he directed the Department of Justice to engage in vindictive prosecutions against enemies like James Comey and Letitia James; and even the degree to which the Trump family’s wealth is reported to have skyrocketed during his first year back in power.

But there is a flip side to all of this — and it goes well beyond Trump’s insistence that all the issues mentioned above are fully legal and above board.

Specifically, Trump has often benefited politically from the idea that he is the victim of sprawling “lawfare” pushed by his political enemies.

In 2024, there was an extraordinary list of apparent black marks against his name — felony convictions for falsifying business records in a case centered on hush-money payments to a porn actor; three outstanding criminal cases, two of which pertained to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election; and the two impeachments.

Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris handily regardless. Months before that, his conviction in the business records case led to his two highest fundraising days of his entire campaign up to that point.

These dynamics — as well as a belief that a purely anti-Trump campaign has electoral limitations — persuade even some Democrats that the party should not put impeachment front and center on the trail this year.

“Give voters something to vote for rather than something to vote against,” Democratic strategist Basil Smikle Jr. counseled his party colleagues.

“The more you talk about impeachment, the less time you spend talking about the voter. You focus on Trump, on what you think are impeachable offenses — but that’s a lot about process, and it takes away from talking about policies.”

Smikle, who is based in New York, cited New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s (D) campaign last year, praising the young democratic socialist for “having a focus on the same things voters are focused on, which is affordability, which is housing, which is opportunity.”

Other Democrats have been making similar arguments in the recent past, even as liberal rage at Trump remains high.

For both Democrats and Republicans alike, the Trump Question is a complicated one.

He energizes base voters on both sides, but a campaign focused upon him can seem increasingly backward-looking, especially when he cannot legally hold office beyond January 2029.

But Trump’s dominance of the political landscape, for good or bad, is so profound that he is nowhere near lame-duck status yet.

His fate will surely hang over the midterms to some degree — just as he has loomed over every election for the past decade.

The Department of Homeland Security described the vehicle’s passenger as “a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring” who had been involved in a recent shooting in Portland. When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants Thursday afternoon, the driver tried to run them over, the department said in a written statement.

“Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,” the statement said. “The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.”

There was no immediate independent corroboration of those events or of any gang affiliation of the vehicle’s occupants. During prior shootings involving agents involved in President Donald Trump’s surge of immigration enforcement in U.S. cities, including Wednesday’s shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, video evidence cast doubt on the administration’s initial descriptions of what prompted the shootings.

According to the Portland police, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting near a hospital at about 2:18 p.m.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a residential area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found the two people with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland City Council meeting that Thursday’s shooting took place in the eastern part of the city and that two Portlanders were wounded.

“As far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon,” she said.

The shooting escalates tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Donald Trump, including Trump’s recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city.

Portland police secured both the scene of the shooting and the area where the wounded people were found pending investigation.

“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” said Chief Bob Day. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the City Council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/AP26009039426357.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-09 09:58:18.671018

Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the plans will roughly double without the subsidies.
The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits, arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”.
“All of those options were rejected, unfortunately, by House leadership, so it left us with two options – either expiration or clean extension.
Fitzpatrick predicted that the Senate will “put their stamp on” the three-year extension, and then the House will consider it again.","The US House of Representatives on Thursday passed legislation to re-establish tax credits that lowered premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans, after a small group of Republicans broke ranks and joined with Democrats to defy Donald Trump on a key healthcare issue that could sway voters ahead of the November midterm elections.

The chamber voted 230-196 to approve a bill that would extend for three years the credits, which were first created under Joe Biden but expired at the end of last year despite a concerted effort by the Democratic minority to continue them.

All Democrats voted for the measure along with 17 Republicans, many of whom were moderates who said they could not tolerate a hike in healthcare costs for their constituents, but acknowledged the House measure will likely be revised by the Republican-controlled Senate before it is enacted.

“I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate, so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Republican congressman Mike Lawler said during a preliminary vote on the bill on Wednesday.

Trump has opposed extending the tax credits, and the Senate last month rejected a Democratic-backed measure similar to the bill that passed the House. Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the plans will roughly double without the subsidies.

The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits, arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”. Democrats made an extension a centerpiece of their demands during the record-long government shutdown that began in October, while moderate Republicans sought to strike a compromise that would be palatable to both parties.

But after Johnson refused to bring any deal to the floor, four Republicans last month signed a discharge petition that forced a vote on the legislation extending the credits for three years, in a significant rebuke of the speaker.

“All of those options were rejected, unfortunately, by House leadership, so it left us with two options – either expiration or clean extension. And clean extension is a far better option, in my view, and that’s why I proceeded down the path that I did,” House representative Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the four Republican signatories, said in an interview with NPR on Thursday.

Fitzpatrick predicted that the Senate will “put their stamp on” the three-year extension, and then the House will consider it again.

Democrats see the tax credits as part of their emphasis on fighting the “affordability crisis”, a key plank of their pitch to voters ahead of the midterm elections in November, when they will seek to retake the Senate and House. Trump, meanwhile, has dismissed the concerns about affordability as a “hoax”, though Johnson has said that Republicans plan to outline their own proposals to lower healthcare costs in the weeks to come.

“The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is very real, despite what Donald Trump had to say,” the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said in a Thursday morning press conference. “Today, we have an opportunity to take a meaningful step forward, lower the high cost of living for everyday Americans, particularly as it relates to healthcare.”

His counterpart in the Senate, the minority leader Chuck Schumer, said that the party did not plan to let the issue go.

“Democrats are going to make healthcare and other high costs, the high cost of living, the No 1 issue for all of 2026,” Schumer said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c734f1977548c4792d99eab46113c659a1d351d2/414_0_4101_3280/master/4101.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4da08e4eb71b46dc82672cf7ad5ca040",N,,2026-01-09 12:12:28.638869

Filed Wednesday by Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the 34-page bill would presume certain non-citizens are at fault in car accidents, severely restrict their employment, and prevent state banks from loaning them money.

It’s the most wide-ranging immigration bundle proposed so far ahead of the 2026 session, and would extend a 2025 crackdown that removed in-state tuition for undocumented students, imposed state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, and required all counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

READ MORE: Florida bill would ban public colleges from admitting undocumented students

The nationwide push to quash all avenues for undocumented immigration has been exemplified in Florida, the first state to create a state-run migrant detention center. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, Sunshine State officials have mirrored his anti-illegal immigration agenda.

This includes deputizing hundreds of state and local officials to act as immigration officers; Florida is the only state to have all of its (67) counties entering into 287(g) agreements, which are partnerships with ICE.

Martin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

E-Verify penalties

SB 1380 would create civil penalties for employers who fail to properly use E-Verify, a federal database that checks whether new hires are legally authorized to work in the country. This builds off of another Martin bill, which would require all businesses to use E-Verify.

Employers who fail to check workers’ immigration status through E-Verify before submitting workers’ compensation claims would be personally liable for any costs, expenses, or benefits for undocumented employees.

Purposely not checking their status, however, would result in suspension of business licenses for one year and fines up to $10,000. Doing it again would result in a five-year license suspension alongside a $100,000 fine, and a third violation would mean permanent license revocation and a $250,000 fine.

If the employer purposely flouts this section and the undocumented worker then ends up injuring another person, the employer’s license would be suspended for five years with a $100,000 fine. If the worker kills another person, the licenses would be permanently revoked with a $500,000 fine.

In a similar vein, the bill would impose a third-degree felony charge for an employer who knowingly hires more than 50 undocumented workers. The business would permanently lose its license. The bill would create a cause of action against the employer for any person injured or the next of kin of a person killed by the actions of an undocumented worker.

These provisions evoke a recently closed, two-year federal investigation into Archer Western, a road-building company hired by the state that employed undocumented immigrants for years, as the Tampa Bay Times has reported.

Officials opened the investigation after an undocumented Archer Western employee driving heavy machinery in 2022 hit and killed a Pinellas County deputy. At least 18 of his coworkers on that state-funded construction site were also undocumented.

Car accidents, foreign remittances, and licensing

SB 1380 would create a rebuttable presumption of fault in car accidents involving undocumented immigrants from other states. This means if an out-of-state driver who is undocumented is involved in a car accident in Florida, authorities could presume he or she was at fault — as long as the other motorist wasn’t driving recklessly, under the influence, or clearly at fault.

Insurers could not pay benefits or settle claims with an unauthorized out-of-state driver, the bill says.

Additionally, the bill requires law enforcement officers investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.

Other provisions would ban the state Division of Risk Management from approving a claim submitted by an adult undocumented immigrant. Unauthorized immigrants would be barred from sending money to other countries and state banks could not accept IDs traditionally used by undocumented immigrants or those illegally in the state with down payments or loans.

All licensing procedures, relicensing instruction, and licensing testing must be conducted in English, the bill says. Interpreters, translators, or alternate language accommodations would be banned.

Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.

1️⃣ Immigration tensions

Two American cities are on edge after separate shootings involving federal immigration agents this week. In Minneapolis, demonstrations are flaring after an ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old US citizen on Wednesday, with protestors demanding the Trump administration end its immigration crackdown in the city. The White House, meanwhile, is defending the actions of the ICE agent involved. In a separate incident, a married couple was hospitalized in Portland, Oregon, after being shot by Border Patrol agents on Thursday. A law enforcement official said the agents were conducting a traffic stop and fired when the suspects attempted to run them over. Portland’s mayor has called on ICE to suspend operations in the city until the shooting is fully investigated.

2️⃣ Presidential powers

Lawmakers are pushing to limit the powers of President Donald Trump in Venezuela as uncertainty mounts over his next steps in the deepening conflict. On Thursday, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to advance a resolution that would limit future US military force in Venezuela without congressional approval. The final resolution is not guaranteed to pass, but the vote deals a symbolic rebuke to the president. It comes just days after the Trump administration launched a strike on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro without the approval of Congress.

3️⃣ Iran internet blackout

Iran was hit with a nationwide internet blackout on Thursday as mass anti-government protests spread amid anger over economic hardship and security crackdowns. Authorities shut down internet access and phone lines shortly after protests erupted in Tehran and other major cities, though the blackout did not immediately stop videos of the demonstrations — now in their second week — from circulating online. At least 45 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, according to the Iran Human Rights NGO. The group says hundreds more have been injured and more than 2,000 people detained.

4️⃣ Home prices

President Trump said he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, citing the current strain on American homebuyers. This comes as corporations such as Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase, and other banks and investment firms have increasingly snapped up family homes in recent years and turned them into rentals. Critics say the practice has driven up home prices and hurt affordability, but some housing experts argue the president’s proposal would have minimal effect on overall housing supply. The cost of buying a home in the US has surged in recent years, fueled by historically low inventory and mortgage rates above 6%. Between early 2020 and the third quarter of 2025, home prices rose nearly 55% nationwide, according to a report from the National Association of Home Builders.

5️⃣ White House

New details emerged on Thursday about President Trump’s East Wing expansion at the White House — including a “grand stair” — and changes to the West Wing Colonnade as well. For the first time, a second story on the West Wing Colonnade was unveiled. It is designed to mirror the East Wing addition after the previous building was demolished last year. Architect Shalom Baranes offered new insight into the size and scope of the project, which drew mild pushback from some members of the National Capital Planning Commission. The East Wing expansion will include a 22,000-square-foot ballroom capable of seating 1,000 guests, with the overall expansion totaling roughly 89,000 square feet. Above-ground construction is expected to begin around April.

“They usually – they make just extreme movements with their vehicles.” Trump administration officials have cited that June case as evidence that ICE agents face deadly threats that compel them to react with extreme force.
“That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday.

Ross’s deadly encounter with Good began on Wednesday as ICE agents worked in Minneapolis.","Last summer, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent found himself in a perilous situation.

His arm was pinned into the back window of a car as a suspect sped away, dragging him across the pavement for about 100 yards, according to court documents. The agent, who suffered injuries to his arm and hand, fired his Taser at the man during the encounter, records show.

Roughly six months later, the same officer faced another driver who hit the gas as he tried to stop her vehicle. This time, he fired with his service weapon – killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

The officer in the June case is identified in court documents as Jonathan Ross. A senior Department Homeland Security official confirmed that case involved the same officer who fired the shots that killed Good this week.

As authorities and lawmakers nationwide seek to untangle the circumstances behind the fatal shooting, Ross’s actions during the incident last summer and his professional background are facing renewed scrutiny.

A transcript of Ross’s testimony from the June case reviewed by CNN adds new detail to his experience, which includes a tour of duty with the National Guard in Iraq as a gunner from 2004 to in 2005. In his testimony he describes performing “hundreds” of traffic stops in his career over nearly two decades in Border Patrol and then ICE – including encounters with drivers seeking to flee.

“They do erratic behaviors, they take great risks, and they seem to not be aware of other people driving on the road,” Ross told the jury. “They usually – they make just extreme movements with their vehicles.”

Trump administration officials have cited that June case as evidence that ICE agents face deadly threats that compel them to react with extreme force.

“That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday. “You think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about someone ramming him with an automobile?”

But local lawmakers and some experts say that this week’s situation was far from life-threatening to the ICE officer, as Good appeared to be swerving away from him as he began shooting.

“To use deadly force… the elements of that have to be so concerning to open up fire on an individual,” said former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, adding in a CNN interview that the agent should simply have gotten out of the way of Good’s car.

Michael Harrigan, a retired FBI agent who now consults on law enforcement practices and tactics, said it’s not unreasonable to believe that the prior car dragging case may have been on the ICE officer’s mind as he pulled the trigger. But Harrigan said agents are trained to evaluate every incident individually.

“The fact is every incident has to stand alone,” Harrigan said. “It doesn’t really matter what they went through before. It’s never going to be a justification for something else. They know that.”

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who declined to name Ross, citing violent threats to ICE agents, said he “is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the officer’s actions.

“This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we’ll continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,” Noem said at a news conference.

Ross served in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard, he testified in court, and then joined Border Patrol in 2007. He said he worked with the agency near El Paso, Texas, where he worked on intelligence about “cartels and drug smuggling,” before joining ICE in 2015.

With ICE, he said, he works in fugitive operations in the Minneapolis area and regularly collaborates with other federal agencies. “I target higher value targets,” he testified.

The agent’s experience in ICE included a selection to a Special Response Team, McLaughlin said, which requires 30 hours of tryouts, continuous training and expert marksman qualifications.

His violent encounter with a suspect last June began when federal officials moved in to arrest Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, an undocumented immigrant who had been charged with sexually abusing a teenage relative in 2022, according to a court affidavit written by an FBI agent involved in the case.

At the time, ICE had requested local officials hold him in jail, but that request was denied, the affidavit said. The affidavit refers to Muñoz-Guatemala as being from Guatemala, while a DHS press release described him as being from Mexico.

On June 17, 2025, federal officials tracked Muñoz-Guatemala to his home in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, and conducted a traffic stop as he started to drive away.

Ross, who was one of several federal agents involved in the arrest, initially drew his service weapon, but holstered the gun after Muñoz-Guatemala stopped his car and raised his hands, according to the affidavit.

The affidavit does not name Ross, only referring to him as an officer for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division, but other court documents including an exhibit and witness list make clear that it is Ross.

Muñoz-Guatemala handed Ross an “identification document,” but refused to follow Ross’s commands to lower his window and open the door, the affidavit says. Ross pointed his Taser at Muñoz-Guatemala, used a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the car’s rear passenger door window, and put his arm through the window to try to open the door.

Muñoz-Guatemala responded by driving the car onto the curb and accelerating away “at a high rate of speed,” according to the affidavit, and Ross was pulled along by his right arm. A door-camera video posted by news channel WCCO shows Muñoz-Guatemala driving away quickly across a lawn, with several officers running after him.

“I was fearing for my life,” Ross testified during the trial.

Ross said he discharged ten rounds of his Taser, hitting Muñoz-Guatemala, and yelled for him to stop “over and over and over again at the top of my lungs.”

Muñoz-Guatemala swerved the car down the street and dragged Ross about 100 yards, according to the affidavit, before the agent was knocked away from the vehicle. Muñoz-Guatemala then drove with the Taser hanging out of the car window, and was arrested about a mile away by local police officers.

Ross suffered a cut to his right arm that required 20 stitches, as well as a cut to his left hand that required 13 stitches, according to the affidavit, which includes photos of Ross’s bloody limbs.

“Some of the wounds they couldn’t close. There wasn’t enough skin to close it with stitches,” Ross said.

Ross also said in court in December that ICE’s field office in the Twin Cities didn’t have a body-worn camera policy. Body-worn cameras were “rolled out to certain offices throughout ICE, and ours was not one of them that was rolled out at that time,” Ross said. As a result, he said, immigration agents in the Minneapolis area “cannot wear them.”

Muñoz-Guatemala was charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon and resulting in bodily injury, and was convicted by a jury in December after a three-day trial. His sentencing is pending.

Ross’s deadly encounter with Good began on Wednesday as ICE agents worked in Minneapolis. Video shows that Good’s vehicle was partially blocking a road that agents were attempting to drive down.

As two other agents rushed toward her window, gesturing at her and trying to open the vehicle’s door, Ross walked to the front of her vehicle.

Good briefly put the vehicle in reverse, then shifted into drive and hit the gas, with the wheels seemingly turned to the right instead of directly ahead toward Ross. It’s unclear whether her vehicle made significant contact with the agent as he began firing, striking her. Her vehicle accelerated down the road, crashing into parked cars nearby. She was later pronounced dead.

In the minutes after the shooting, Ross is seen in witness videos approaching Good’s crashed vehicle, before walking away and telling other officers to call 911. He and at least one other agent then drove away in another vehicle.

Experts in law enforcement questioned Ross’s actions in the shooting, telling CNN that the agent appeared to violate several key rules for engaging with suspects in vehicles.

ICE’s own general policy is that agents should not chase vehicles or fire at them unless there is imminent danger, said John Amaya, a former deputy chief of staff for the agency during the Obama administration. He said that many agents are not trained in crowd control practices or interacting with residents, adding that that can make certain interactions “a recipe for disaster.”

Charles Ramsey, a former Philadelphia police commissioner, told CNN that many law enforcement agencies around the country have restricted officers in their interactions with suspects in vehicles.

“You don’t reach into cars – that’s how you wind up getting dragged down the street,” Ramsey said. “You don’t stand in front or behind a car with the engine running… Policies around the country have pretty much prohibited firing at a moving car.”

Some of Ross’s actions could be legally justified, Ramsey noted. “But just because you can doesn’t mean you should,” he said. “Use of deadly force is an absolute last resort when you don’t have other options. He had other options. Don’t stand in front of the freaking car – that’s option number one.”

Today's top stories

Two separate incidents that happened this week are calling attention to shootings by federal immigration authorities. Yesterday in Portland, Ore., a Customs and Border Patrol agent shot and injured two people. The mayor of Portland is now calling for an end to all ICE activity in the area. The incident comes a day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota. Good was shot while inside her car during an encounter with multiple ICE agents.

🎧 NPR has confirmed the identity of the shooter to be Jonathan Ross, NPR's Meg Anderson tells Up First. Department of Homeland Security officers say he is an experienced officer, not a recent hire. The FBI has taken over the investigation, Anderson adds. State authorities say they no longer have access to evidence about the shooting, which means the federal government is the only entity investigating a shooting committed by its own agent. Yesterday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz questioned the fairness of the investigation.

➡️ Protests are growing in Minneapolis over Good's death. These photos provide a glimpse into the community's reaction since the shooting occurred.

🎧 Shootings by immigration authorities appear to be becoming more frequent as the Trump administration ramps up its immigration crackdowns, NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán says. Yesterday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed that immigration agents in Minneapolis were going door to door to find undocumented migrants. Martínez-Beltrán says this strategy is unusual given that ICE operations are typically targeted. He adds that these shootings could be a devastating side effect of this broader approach.

A new NPR/Ipsos poll reveals that while Americans across the political spectrum want the U.S. to be a global moral leader, fewer believe it holds that title today. The survey highlights a significant gap: 61% of respondents believe the U.S. should be a moral leader, while 39% believe it actually is one. The latter figure shows a steep decline from 2017, when 60% of Americans viewed the nation as a moral leader in a similar survey. This is what the poll says about American foreign policy.

A group of 17 House Republicans joined Democrats yesterday to pass a measure to restore health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of last year. While the three-year extension passed by a vote of 230 to 196, the measure faces a likely dead end in the Senate, where a similar proposal failed just last month. However, a bipartisan group of senators says they are close to a deal on a compromise bill.

Special series

President Trump has tried to bury the truth of what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. NPR built a visual archive of the attack on the Capitol, showing exactly what happened through the lenses of the people who were there. ""Chapter 5: The pardons and rewriting of Jan. 6"" examines how Trump's pardons, political messaging and use of power reshaped the public narrative.

While Trump initially condemned the Jan. 6 attack, he soon switched his stance by embracing the rioters as ""political prisoners."" On Jan. 12, 2025, just eight days before Trump's inauguration, incoming Vice President Vance said that the administration would not pardon defendants convicted of assaulting police. But one of Trump's first acts in office was to grant full pardons to most defendants. Only 14 defendants — all of whom were linked to extremist groups — received commutations, meaning they were released from prison, but the convictions remained on their records. The Trump administration then deleted a government database containing cases linked to the attack. Evidence began disappearing from a site that shared court exhibits with the media. Explore the aftermath of the pardons, including which Trump appointees advocated for Jan. 6 defendants.

""The reason this woman is dead is because she tried to ram somebody with her car,"" he told a news briefing at the White House on Thursday.
He defended himself,"" Vance s aid.
Tim Walz is also disputing the White House version of events.","The official White House narrative of how a U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen in her vehicle in Minneapolis is bumping hard up against what can be seen in videos of the incident.

U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are all insisting that the victim, Renee Nicole Good, deliberately rammed her vehicle into an ICE officer who then fired shots in self-defence because he feared for his life.

Yet three videos from the scene — each verified by CBC News as authentic — contradict these claims and raise serious questions about why the White House is defending the fatal shooting as justified.

What the videos show

Two of the videos were filmed from street level in close proximity to Good's vehicle, at similar angles from the rear and sides. The third was filmed from above, at some distance away, showing the front of the vehicle.

Good's SUV, a burgundy Honda Pilot, is seen parked horizontally across partially snow-covered Portland Avenue, its engine idling and driver's side window rolled down.

A grey pickup truck drives up to about a car-length away from the driver's side of Good's vehicle. Two masked ICE officers emerge, walk briskly toward the SUV and repeatedly order Good to get out. One of the officers grabs the driver’s side door handle and tries to open it.

Then, as the SUV reverses briefly, a third ICE officer is seen stepping in front of the vehicle, from the passenger side.

Good turns her front wheels to the right and her vehicle starts to move forward. At that point, the third officer appears to be less a metre in front of the driver's side edge of the SUV's hood.

The officer then pulls his gun and fire s what appears to be three shots into the vehicle. It is unclear if the front of the vehicle has passed him as he fires the first shot.

What Trump, Vance and Noem say happened

Just two hours after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a statement blaming Good. The statement, posted on X, claimed that ""rioters began blocking ICE officers"" as the incident unfolded. No sign of rioters can be seen in any videos of the shooting.

“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,” read the DHS statement. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

A few hours later, Noem told reporters the woman ""attacked"" ICE officers ""and attempted to run them over"" in what she described as ""an act of domestic terrorism.""

Trump issued a social media post on Wednesday afternoon, attaching the video that was filmed from furthest away. He claimed that Good was ""very disorderly, obstructing and resisting"" and that she ""violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”

None of the videos show Good's vehicle running over the officer.

'Tragedy of her own making'

Vance has been the most vehement in suggesting the shooting was justified and blaming Good.

""The reason this woman is dead is because she tried to ram somebody with her car,"" he told a news briefing at the White House on Thursday.

""It's a tragedy of her own making,"" Vance said. ""You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator. Nobody debates that.""

Numerous officials in Minneapolis are, in fact, debating just that. Yet Vance insisted that the video evidence backs up his version of events.

""When you look at all angles of that video, it is very clear that her vehicle went right for the guy. She actually collided with him. And then that's, of course, when he fired his shots. That's obvious.""

It is unclear from the videos whether the vehicle makes contact with the officer. The officer stayed on his feet for the entire duration of the shooting and can be observered walking around the scene after the shooting with no apparent injury.

""She was trying to ram this guy with her car. He shot back. He defended himself,"" Vance s aid. He also accused media outlets that are reporting what happened any differently of ""lying about this attack.""

Videos don't support White House narrative: expert

John Gross, an associate professor of law at the University of Wisconsin Law School who has written extensively about police use of force, reviewed the videos and concluded that what they show does not match the narrative from the White House.

""The claim that this is some act of domestic terrorism is nonsensical,"" Gross told CBC's Power and Politics on Thursday.

""She never attempted to ram the officer who eventually shot her,"" he said.

""The idea that the vehicle was being used as a weapon or was targetting the officers, it's clearly not supported by video evidence that we have from the scene.""

Gross says the bullet hole just a few centimetres from the lower driver's side corner of the windshield, indicates the officer first fired from beside the vehicle.

He says the two subsequent shots came as the car was turning away from the officer.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is also disputing the White House version of events.

""People in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice-president to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,"" Walz told a news conference on Thursday.

With the two most powerful elected officials in the U.S. already attempting to exonerate the officer, there are now concerns that the FBI investigation into what happened will lack independence.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a social media post on Thursday that Noem ""doesn't want an impartial investigation because she knows her narrative about domestic terrorism is bullshit.""

Frey's post came in response to the news that Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension would not have access to any evidence gathered by the FBI as part of its probe into the shooting.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/caf0c9cb-cbcc-47bf-81ac-5b73d22f0f39,1767899104677/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%28200%2C416%2C3194%2C1796%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-09 11:59:28.490704

REPORT:

The executive orders the report recommends be rescinded came out during the president's 30-day crime emergency that began in August.

The mayor's Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center order manages the District's response to the Safe and Beautiful Task Force created by the president's March executive order, to the president's 30-day crime emergency initiated in August, and ""on a continuing basis."" The order allows local coordination with federal law enforcement to the extent allowed by District law.

Former MPD Chief Pamela Smith's order authorizes the police department to share details with immigration agencies about people not in their custody, such as during traffic stops, and to provide transportation for immigration employees and detained people.

The mayor had no comment Thursday on the call for those executive orders to be rescinded.

MPD Interim Chief Jeffery Carroll told reporters his team is evaluating whether to rescind the police order: ""We'll continue to evaluate the policies and kind of see what the best path is forward.""

“A lot of these individuals [federal enforcement], they don't work in urban policing, so us working with federal authorities in the policing operations, being out there, actually helps us to make sure that we can work in those areas to help control what’s going on,"" Carroll said.

""If we don't want ICE in our communities, we have to stop funding ICE,"" Bowser said. ""And that decision isn’t made here, it's made at the Congress.""

These are the specific actions the committee is calling for, per the report:

Rescind Emergency Orders: The Mayor should cancel the Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center order, which allows coordination with federal authorities ""to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.”

Stop Information Sharing: The interim police chief should end policies that allow officers to share information during traffic stops or provide transportation for federal detainees.

Enforce Identification: The Council wants federal officers to follow the same rules as MPD, prohibiting them from wearing masks and requiring them to show clear identification.

Strengthen Local Law: The report urges the passage of the Safe Community Places and Policing Amendment Act, which would legally prohibit D.C. agencies from participating in immigration enforcement.

""Our police force should not be dealing with immigration or assisting with immigration enforcement, full stop, and that to me is a very clear line,"" Nadeau told 7News, explaining immigration violations are civil offenses. ""It's different than MPD having an opportunity to collaborate with the FBI or the ATF to get drugs or guns off the street.""

Belarus’s exploitation of Interpol not only creates constitutional tension but also undermines the protection of fundamental rights on European soil.
How politically motivated alerts enter EU systems and create structural challenges The consequences of politically motivated alerts unfold outside Interpol.
Such abuse of Interpol is not only a tool of repression but exposes structural vulnerabilities in the Schengen architecture.
The procedural paradox Belarus’s engagement with Interpol shows how legal structures designed for cooperation can be repurposed into tools of transnational repression.","When Belarusian filmmaker and activist Andrei Hnyot was detained at a Serbian border crossing in October 2023, the charges seemed routine: tax evasion. But Hnyot had fled Belarus after participating in the 2020 protests, and the Interpol Red Notice that triggered his arrest originated from Minsk. Despite intervention by the European Parliament and credible evidence of political motivation, he spent a year in detention before his release. His case is not an exception; it is a pattern.

In October 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Belarus, urging the EU and its member states to “put an end to the alarming level of transnational repression conducted by the Lukashenka regime.” Naming Belarus among the top ten perpetrators of transnational repression, the resolution specifically warned of Minsk’s instrumentalisation of Interpol’s intelligence and data-sharing mechanisms to persecute exiled Belarusians beyond its borders.

Following the fraudulent 2020 presidential election, the mass protests, and the subsequent brutal governmental crackdown, more than 500,000 Belarusians sought safety in European states. For those who escaped, many of them opposition figures, activists, and journalists, repression did not end at the border. The Lukashenka regime declared them fugitives and developed an array of tactics to persecute and silence them, with Interpol as a key instrument.

These practices directly implicate EU constitutional law, creating what might be called a procedural paradox: cooperation systems built on mutual trust must now routinely filter politically motivated data to uphold non-refoulement obligations. These include examining compliance with Articles 3 and 6 ECHR and Articles 19 and 47 of the Charter. The prohibition on political persecution requires much stronger systems to catch fabricated and politically motivated cases.

EU constitutional challenges

Politically motivated Interpol alerts test the limits of mutual trust, the principle that EU member states can rely on each other’s judicial systems meeting baseline rule-of-law standards. When corrupted alerts enter shared enforcement systems, European authorities face a dilemma. They must balance maintaining effective judicial and law-enforcement cooperation with protecting fundamental rights guarantees.

The Court of Justice has addressed analogous tensions within the EU itself. In Aranyosi and Căldăraru, the Court held that even the high level of trust underpinning the European Arrest Warrant can be rebutted where systemic deficiencies in detention conditions create a real risk of inhuman treatment. Member States must then assess individual circumstances before executing a warrant. The logic extends to third-country data entering EU systems: where a state demonstrates systematic rule-of-law deficits, European authorities cannot simply process alerts at face value but must apply enhanced scrutiny to protect fundamental rights.

First, abusive alerts engage non-refoulement obligations. Article 3 ECHR and Article 19 of the EU Charter are substantive prohibitions against returning individuals to states where they face persecution or torture. Second, they undermine the prohibition of political persecution, which remains central both to extradition law and asylum procedures. Article 18 ECHR, which prohibits the use of restrictions on rights for purposes other than those prescribed, is also engaged parasitically to Articles 3 and 6 ECHR, where prosecution requests are used for political ends. Third, they threaten fair-trial and due-process guarantees under Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 EU Charter when individuals cannot access or challenge the data held against them. This last concern is particularly acute in the Belarusian context: when the Minsk National Central Bureau (NCB) applies data-access restrictions, and the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files cannot compel disclosure, targeted individuals are effectively denied the right to an effective remedy, a core Article 47 guarantee. Belarus’s exploitation of Interpol not only creates constitutional tension but also undermines the protection of fundamental rights on European soil. Understanding these constitutional stakes requires a brief look at Interpol’s framework and its vulnerabilities.

Interpol’s architecture and its vulnerability

Interpol’s mandate is narrowly defined. Created to facilitate police cooperation against transnational crime, it provides a secure communication network, databases, and a colour-coded notice system. The International Criminal Police organisation operates through decentralised National Central Bureaus (NCBs), embedded in domestic law-enforcement structures. NCBs submit data and request alerts on Interpol’s platform.

Red Notices request the location and provisional arrest of a particular person. Once issued by Interpol’s General Secretariat, it is circulated to all 196 member states and copied into national systems, such as the Schengen Information System, national watchlists or immigration databases. While not an international arrest warrant, Red Notices are the “sniper rifle of autocrats”, used to persecute dissidents across borders.

Interpol does not investigate underlying facts, evaluate political context, or assess the human-rights situation of the requesting state. Its framework assumes that NCBs act in good faith. Article 3 of Interpol’s Constitution prohibits political activity, and the Rules on the Processing of Data (RPD) require reliable judicial information before an alert is issued. However, compliance depends largely on the requesting state, which creates a structural vulnerability.

Belarus systematically exploits this weakness. Leaked audio recordings from 2021 reveal senior law-enforcement officials, including NCB staff, discussing how to conceal the political nature of cases by reframing them as ordinary criminal charges. Charges of tax evasion, fraud, property offences or defamation are particularly popular in Minsk. The formal labels satisfy Interpol’s technical thresholds while the political intent remains concealed.

Data restrictions and information blackout

This misuse of Interpol by Belarus extends beyond charge manipulation. A more recent and worrying tactic adopted by the NCB in Minsk is the extensive use of data-access restrictions. While intended to protect sensitive investigations, such restrictions prevent individuals from confirming whether they appear in Interpol’s systems. They block access to the information needed to challenge a Notice before Interpol’s quasi-judicial review body, the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files (CCF).

Interpol’s rules require NCBs to justify every restriction. But if an NCB provides vague or inconclusive responses, the CCF cannot compel disclosure. When the requesting authority is uncooperative, restrictions can therefore persist. Belarusian lawyers face parallel obstacles: defence counsel are routinely denied access to case files for clients abroad. The combined effect is an information blackout. This makes it nearly impossible for exiles to verify accusations, contest data, or defend themselves.

How politically motivated alerts enter EU systems and create structural challenges

The consequences of politically motivated alerts unfold outside Interpol. Once a Red Notice or diffusion (direct alert between NCBs) is circulated, it is processed by border police, immigration authorities, and courts bound by procedural safeguards and human-rights obligations. EU systems designed for rapid information exchange cannot instantly distinguish between politically motivated data and legitimate alerts. Red Notice Monitor has documented this issue in the UK immigration context.

The case of Belarusian filmmaker and activist Andrei Hnyot illustrates the stakes. Hnyot, who participated in the 2020 protests, was detained in Serbia in October 2023 on a Belarus-requested Red Notice alleging tax evasion. He sought asylum, citing a credible risk of torture. The European Parliament urged Serbia not to extradite him, and independent media questioned the charges. Nonetheless, Hnyot spent a year in detention before his release in late 2024. Similarly, in 2024, Polish police detained a Belarusian man, already granted protection in Poland, on the basis of a Red Notice. Previously, Valiantsin Vlasik, who had received a humanitarian visa in Poland, was detained at the Hungarian border on the basis of a request alleging financial crimes. He had spent six months in a pre-trial detention centre before being released and able to return to Poland.

In these cases, courts ultimately refused extradition. The political motives were apparent, and the risk of ill-treatment overwhelming. But the cases reveal the core constitutional tension: Belarus exploits procedural legitimacy to trigger EU legal obligations designed for democratic partners bound by the rule of law. This exploitation of Interpol penetrates the foundations of European cooperation and thereby jeopardises fundamental rights guarantees on European soil.

EU responses and the procedural paradox

The EU has begun to respond. Courts consistently refuse extradition to Belarus. Asylum authorities treat alerts from states with systemic human-rights violations as strong indicators of risk. Several Member States have issued internal guidance to police and migration officials on handling high-risk alerts. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for stricter scrutiny and stronger safeguards. In November 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on addressing transnational repression.

The issue for the EU is not a lack of awareness but the practical difficulty of filtering politically motivated data in real time while respecting the rule of law. So far, the adopted measures do not eliminate the initial impact. Individuals may still be detained, questioned when travelling, or face delays in immigration procedures. To challenge and have a Notice deleted from Interpol’s databases can take many months, even years. After deletion from Interpol’s systems, outdated data often lingers in national systems until manually removed by the respective NCB. This leaves individuals in legal limbo. An atmosphere of fear ensues, and Belarus achieves the desired effect of transnational repression: to silence dissent.

These dynamics create a procedural paradox. EU authorities ultimately comply with fundamental-rights requirements, yet politically motivated information generates operational friction in a system premised on trust. Immigration, law enforcement, and legal systems face administrative strain in processing information that should never have entered shared databases. Such abuse of Interpol is not only a tool of repression but exposes structural vulnerabilities in the Schengen architecture.

This paradox is amplified by Western policy incoherence. Since 2021, the regime has orchestrated engineered migration flows, airspace provocations, and other forms of non-military pressure. Many Belarusians face visa refusals, banking restrictions, renting obstacles, and administrative discrimination in Europe, partly a by-product of Western sanctions and political tensions. Between 2020 and 2023, Western states oscillated between slow-moving sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and reactive measures, creating unpredictable incentives for Minsk. Unable to settle on a unified Belarus strategy, the West inadvertently left space for Belarusian coercive practices to spill into international policing systems.

Regional authoritarian networks and Russian alignment

Belarus’s deepening alignment with Russia since 2020 adds a further layer of concern. As Minsk integrates into a Russian-anchored authoritarian security system that includes other post-Soviet states, the potential for coordinated misuse increases. These networks share prosecution strategies and policing infrastructure. A single alert can circulate across multiple jurisdictions that assume it reflects legitimate criminal suspicion. This increases the volume of politically motivated data entering international systems. For authoritarian states it is a low-cost tool of pressure, while democratic states must invest time, resources, and legal safeguards to mitigate the harm.

The procedural paradox

Belarus’s engagement with Interpol shows how legal structures designed for cooperation can be repurposed into tools of transnational repression. The European Parliament resolution of October 2025 recognised this threat, urging Member States to end the alarming level of transnational repression conducted by the Lukashenka regime. Yet the challenge remains: cooperation systems built on mutual trust must now routinely filter politically motivated data. European authorities comply with fundamental-rights requirements, but the process generates operational friction, administrative strain, and prolonged legal limbo for targeted individuals. Belarus achieves its desired effect, silencing dissent through fear, even when extradition is ultimately refused.

A path forward

Addressing this problem requires a shift from reactive case-by-case handling towards coordinated structural safeguards. Member States should adopt presumptive non-enforcement protocols for Belarus-originated alerts, requiring enhanced verification before any enforcement action. Embedding country-risk indicators directly into Schengen Information System II would allow authorities to flag alerts from states with systemic rule-of-law deficiencies. Rapid-response legal assistance mechanisms for targeted individuals would reduce the disproportionate burden currently placed on exiled Belarusians navigating opaque procedures to clear their names.

Interpol itself must strengthen its Commission for the Control of Files by enabling automatic disclosure challenges when restrictions lack proper justification. Periodic audits of national bureaus with documented patterns of misuse would help prevent the repeated insertion of unreliable data into international policing systems.

The misuse of Interpol is more than a human-rights issue; it is a test of whether European information-sharing systems can withstand deliberate attempts to manipulate their procedural foundations. Closing these structural vulnerabilities is essential not only to protect those who have fled persecution but to ensure that international police cooperation remains anchored in the rule of law.",https://verfassungsblog.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/feature_vb.png,N,,2026-01-09 09:58:57.589113

The FBI’s Portland office said it was investigating an “agent involved shooting” that happened around 2:15 p.m. According to the the Portland Police bureau, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting near a hospital.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a different area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found the two people with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland city council meeting that Thursday’s shooting took place in the eastern part of the city and that two Portlanders were wounded.

“As far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon,” she said.

The shooting comes a day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. It escalated tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Trump, including Trump’s recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city.

Portland police secured both the scene of the shooting and the area where the wounded people were found pending investigation.

“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” said Chief Bob Day. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the City Council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, urged any protesters to remain peaceful.

Vice President JD Vance said, without providing evidence, Good was part of a ""broader left-wing network"" opposed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and insisted the officer acted in ""self-defense."" The White House asserted that US law enforcement was under ""organized attack"" and presented a version of the shooting disputed by officials in Minnesota, who contend that federal forces are making the streets more dangerous.

Large, noisy crowds gathered around Minneapolis in protest on Thursday, chanting slogans against ICE. Federal immigration officers armed with pepperball guns and tear gas wrestled several protesters to the ground.

In a separate incident Thursday afternoon, US federal agents shot and wounded two individuals in the western city of Portland, Oregon, local police said. ""Two people are in the hospital following a shooting involving federal agents,"" a statement from Portland Police said, adding a man and a woman were wounded by ""apparent gunshot wounds.""

Speaking at a news conference late Thursday, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek voiced concern about the use of force by federal agents in Portland and called for a full investigation into the shooting.

'Smoke and mirrors'

Trump and senior officials have claimed that in the Minneapolis incident, Good was trying to kill the ICE agents. ""I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either,"" the president told The New York Times.

Footage from Wednesday shows an agent attempting to open Good's car door before another officer, standing near the front bumper, fires three times into the moving Honda SUV. The vehicle veers into parked cars, as horrified onlookers hurl abuse at the federal officers before her bloodied body appears slumped at the wheel.

Immigrant deportations

Protests in Minneapolis grew after Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz called it a ""patriotic duty"" to demonstrate. ""Watching that woman get murdered yesterday – no more. This can't continue to happen. And I can't sit home and just watch it,"" 62-year-old Shanda Copeland told AFP at a protest in the city on Thursday. ""I feel like at least I'm here and I'll raise my voice as loud as I can.""

Minneapolis schools were closed Thursday and Friday in anticipation of unrest. Walz said Minnesota must participate in the shooting probe alongside federal investigators – otherwise Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ""is judge, jury and basically executioner.""

But Vance suggested the officer would be cleared by a federal probe that would exclude state-level officials. ""The idea that this was not justified is absurd,"" he said.

Wednesday's incident came during protests over immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, where locals are expressing widespread anger over Trump's vow to arrest and deport ""millions"" of undocumented people. The victim's mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune her daughter ""was probably terrified"" and ""not part"" of anti-ICE activity.

Religious leaders addressed crowds at the scene of Good's death, where a memorial of flowers and candles was growing.

Council Committee on Public Works and Operations criticizes Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration, accusing it of failing to be transparent with residents about police collaboration with federal immigration authorities.

Bowser and city officials, including D.C. police, have insisted officers do not participate in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities. However, the report cites witness testimony and media reports placing D.C. police at the scene of some ICE operations.

On Thursday, the day after ICE agents in Minneapolis shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Bowser weighed in.

“You have people who are unaccustomed to urban policing trying to police in an urban environment,” Bowser said. “I’m not a police officer; I’m not in law enforcement, but what I saw was completely avoidable. And a woman died.”

Bowser would not directly comment on the report, but said she is reviewing it.

The outgoing mayor did say she understands people’s outrage when it comes to ICE’s deployment, but that outrage should be placed where it belongs: Congress.

“You could ask me a thousand questions; you could send a thousand questions to the chief about ICE,” she said. “ICE is patrolling American cities. If we don’t want that, Congress has to stop funding ICE because thousands of agents who are untrained to police in urban environments are on our streets. That’s where the questions should be placed.”

D.C. Council members have repeatedly asked officials why police officers were present at immigration enforcement scenes, but officials have declined to explain. Testimony in the report indicated it appeared the officers were cooperating with ICE.

The committee noted Bowser faced a challenging situation under President Donald Trump, who is known for retaliating against politicians who’ve defied him. Nevertheless, the report urged Bowser and D.C. police to reverse policies that facilitated greater cooperation with federal immigration agents and called for increased transparency about the nature of that collaboration.

Hardly any Republican officials said, “I have no comment until an investigation has taken place” or hedged bets about the facts and their meaning. As journalists and average social-media users pored over grainy images of the shooting and began to question the official account, Trumpworld’s solidarity with the shooter showed no signs of weakening. Whatever private misgivings Republicans have about Kristi Noem’s immediate and repeated claims that Renee Nicole Good’s death was the result of her own complicity in “domestic terrorism,” they’re closing ranks for the time being, with Vice-President J.D. Vance leading cheers for ICE.

This “rush to judgment” (as a former ICE director, John Sandweg, called it) suggests a highly politicized reaction to the shooting. Yes, some Democrats were quick to call the shooting a criminal act (and their position seems pretty clearly to be supported by the evidence we currently have). But it’s the GOP reaction that is most formidable and puzzling. Much of it could simply reflect the customary GOP deference to Trump, who immediately called the shooting an act of self-defense and identified the victim with the usual “radical left” suspects he fingers whenever something bad happens. But the broader optics of the incident suggest an extraordinary degree of collective Republican self-confidence that, facts aside, support for the shooter is good politics for the GOP.

Seen from 40,000 feet, the shooting and the entire set of controversies over ICE and its terroristic tactics represent the confluence of two issues Republicans think will invariably work in their favor: immigration and crime/policing. It’s true that immigration remains a relative bright spot for Trump among generally negative job-approval ratings. And the mass-deportation initiative that is ICE’s principal mission is very close to the heart of the MAGA movement. Meanwhile, the 2024 presidential campaign made it very clear Republicans believe that pandemic-era protests about police brutality (galvanized by the police murder of George Floyd less than a mile from where Renee Nicole Good had her own fatal encounter with law enforcement) have boomeranged and fed widespread public concerns about crime and disorder, real or just perceived. An associated “Back the Blue” movement is evident around the country, particularly in MAGA-land, and it’s entirely possible Republicans figure they can extend that presumption of police benevolence to ICE, hard as it might be to envision these armed and masked tormenters of immigrants as heroes.

More generally, Republicans may figure a national focus on ICE tactics wrong-foots Democrats, not only by reidentifying them with the phantom menace of “defunding the police” (with scattered Democratic calls for the total abolition of ICE contributing to that caricature) but by shifting the partisan battleground in the GOP’s direction. At present, Democratic politicians are being constantly hectored by consultants to put on blinders and ignore every issue other than “affordability.” In particular, they’ve been warned again and again not to “take Trump’s bait” by letting his rhetorical excesses (again on vivid display in his callous reaction to the Minneapolis shooting) distract them from obsessively talking about housing and grocery prices. The last week has been sheer torment for such Democrats between the Venezuela military strike and now the tragedy in Minnesota. A national debate on mass deportation and ICE tactics that spills over into disputes about the legitimacy of anti-ICE protests and general attitudes toward law enforcement is a nice distraction from Trump’s unpopular economic and foreign-policy agenda. And to the extent this debate remains focused on events in Minnesota, it keeps attention fixed on a blue state that Republicans would love to keep talking about, given the ongoing scandal over illegal pandemic-era spending in child-care programs linked to criminal immigrant networks of fraudsters.

All in all, Republicans probably found it easy to follow Trump’s lead in defending the Minneapolis shooter because this posture gratifies the MAGA base while muddying adverse waters of current events. Before last week, the GOP was staring down the barrel of a midterm-election defeat and fretting about a president who blamed voters for ingratitude about the glorious blessings he had bestowed on them. Now they’re on more familiar and comfortable ground, even as Democrats prepare for more wrangling about how they talk about immigration and policing.

Cuts hit nearly every major federal agency

Budget data points to little cost savings

WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. federal workforce has fallen to its lowest level in at least a decade, according to government data published on Thursday, a result of President Donald Trump’s campaign to shrink the government.

Cuts this year have hit nearly every major federal agency, according to the statistics from the Office of Personnel Management. Several lost more than a quarter of their staff, including the Departments of Education, Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development. The Department of Homeland Security is an exception, with headcount barely fluctuating since Trump took office.

The U.S. government employs 2.1 million workers, according to OPM statistics.

The federal government has long been seen as a stable employer, with staff commonly spending decades working inside U.S. agencies. Trump and his team sought to change that at the start of his second term, as he argued that the federal government was bloated and inefficient. Thursday's figures showed the administration’s progress on that goal.

""This effort ensures taxpayer dollars support a workforce that delivers efficient, responsive and high-quality services,"" said OPM Director Scott Kupor.

Budget data points to little, if any, cost savings. The government has spent close to $244 billion on federal salaries since Trump returned to the White House, 3% more than it did during the same period under Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, according to a Reuters analysis of daily spending figures released by the Treasury Department.

Overall, federal spending under Trump is up about 7%, driven by growth in Social Security outlays and interest payments on the national debt, according to the same daily Treasury statements.

Billionaire and former Trump adviser Elon Musk initiated the downsizing effort, with backing from his team at his Department of Government Efficiency. Days after Trump's second term began, his administration sent a buyout offer by email to civilian federal employees, saying that the administration could not give ""full assurance"" that their positions would not be eliminated.

That email prompted tens of thousands of them to leave their jobs. Other messages from Musk and his team put employees on edge, including his requirement that they send an email listing five things they accomplished that week.

Thousands of employees left their agencies in the following weeks, after the Trump administration directed cabinet secretaries to dismiss employees who were new to their roles.

Agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS, later dismissed more employees as part of mass layoffs. Disease researchers, tax collectors and medical-device staffers were among the employees that lost their jobs.

Federal worker unions and their allies sued over the terminations. Many of the lawsuits are still pending in court.

Musk left the Trump administration in May, following a public clash with Trump. DOGE no longer exists as a centralized entity, Kupor told Reuters in November.

The FBI said that the BCA would “no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,” said BCA Superintendent Drew Evans.

“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,” Evans said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the decision on Thursday, saying that state investigators “don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation,” despite crimes like murder typically not rising to a federal offense unless a federal officer is killed.

The move has sparked outcry, with critics saying that the Trump administration is trying to cover up the killing.

“You don’t cut out investigators unless you’re hiding something. Kristi Noem’s DHS is covering up the killing of a U.S. citizen,” said the Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee in a post on X.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are also seeking to shield DHS from facing accountability for the killing.

In the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts) motioned to subpoena DHS and ICE for records and footage of the shooting in order for members of Congress to help hold the government accountable.

However, Republicans blocked the move, with every GOP member voting against it.

“DHS’ claim that an agent shot in self-defense is a bold-faced lie and the video footage is damning,” said Pressley in a statement after the vote. “But after I moved to subpoena all records and footage related to this killing, Republicans shamefully voted it down — demonstrating once again that they have never cared about law and order or keeping our communities safe.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/2026_01-08-minneapolis-ice.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 02:57:04.667684

The FBI’s Portland office said it was investigating an “agent involved shooting” that happened around 2:15 p.m. According to the Portland Police bureau, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting near a hospital.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a different area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found the two people with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland city council meeting that Thursday’s shooting took place in the eastern part of the city and that two Portlanders were wounded.

“As far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon,” she said.

The shooting comes a day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. It escalated tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Donald Trump, including Trump's recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city.

Portland police secured both the scene of the shooting and the area where the wounded people were found pending investigation.

“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” said Chief Bob Day. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the city council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, urged any protesters to remain peaceful.

“Trump wants to generate riots,” he said in a post on the X social media platform. “Don’t take the bait.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP25310677673482,N,,2026-01-09 03:57:18.949248

Schwartz Federal Building on Thursday gathered dozens of people to ""demand an end to the bloodshed and inhumane treatment of immigrants by Immigration & Customs Enforcement.

The protest, which officially began at 11 a.m., comes one day after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer in an immigration-related operation in Minneapolis.

""Protesters in San Diego are calling for an end to violent, out-of-control immigration operations with ICE raiding communities and tearing families apart,"" a statement from SEIU Local 221 said.

The local represents more than 12,000 workers in San Diego and Imperial counties, which also said that ""fear, displacement and dehumanizing politics [are being] used to attack and kill working people must stop.""

A governmental protest at the site has been taking place every Thursday for months, though Thursday's event was by far the largest NBC 7's immigration reporter Shelby Bremer said she had witnessed.

NBC 7 asked ICE for a statement about Thursday's protest and was told that, while the agency supports people's rights to free speech and to peacefully assemble, ICE agents are the targets of retribution and endangered for performing their jobs.

San Diego County Board of Supervisors Terra Lawson-Remer and Paloma Aguirre were scheduled to attend the demonstration, along with members of multiple labor and activist organizations, including the San Diego & Imperial Counties Labor Council AFL-CIO, Unión del Barrio and San Diego Education Association.

“People have a right to protest against ICE’s brutality,"" said Emily Von Gerichten, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, in a news release issued on Thursday morning. ""Any politician who is urging people to stay home and shut up is part of the problem. We have seen time and again that the Trump administration will try to criminalize people exercising their free speech rights. But we will not be intimidated and we will continue to raise our voice until we win justice for Renee Nicole Good and end ICE’s mass deportations once and for all.”

At one point on Thursday night, a confrontation broke out between protesters and a van. Seconds after, volunteers were pushing protesters to clear the area as the San Diego Police Department closed in on the street.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, was killed while attempting to leave an Immigrations & Customs Enforcement stop. In a series of viral videos, an ICE agent, who has yet to be identified, is seen standing to the front left of Good's vehicle as she turned her wheels to the right. He shot her through the windshield.

Good died at the scene. She is survived by a partner and a 6-year-old child.

""Renee was one of the kindest people I've ever known,"" Donna Ganger, Good's mother, told the Minnesota Star Tribune. ""She was extremely compassionate. She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, described Good as a ""legal observer."" Minneapolis Police Department Chief Brian O'Hara said it does not appear the woman was the ""target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the ICE agent acted ""in self-defense"" and that Good hit him with her car, requiring a hospital visit.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris had a different view.

""Many of us have seen the horrifying and painful video, which makes it clear that the Trump administration's explanation of this shooting is pure gaslighting,"" Harris said.

President Donald Trump wrote on social media, ""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital. The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.

The bills that advanced Thursday would codify the directive almost exactly into state law.","“Anyone who is an ancestor of a Holocaust survivor will tell you, this is how it starts,” state Sen. Britnee Timberlake said before the state Senate Judiciary Committee. Timberlake had a translator sharing her comments in Spanish to a packed committee room.

“If you don’t believe me, just ask the children of the 37-year-old woman from Minnesota, a white American citizen, who was just shot and killed by ICE.”

The shooting of the woman, Renee Good, sparked nationwide outrage, particularly among Democrats. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Thursday she intends to push for expanded legal protections against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement. And in New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy told reporters Thursday that the shooting was “horrifying, deplorable, despicable” and not “remotely merited.”

New Jersey lawmakers advanced the trio of bills in their Assembly and Senate committees along party lines, teeing them up for a full vote in the Legislature next week. The effort and comments from state lawmakers — which began in the Statehouse shortly before the Minnesota shooting — have already received pushback from the White House.

“ICE officers are facing a massive increase [in] assaults against them because of dangerous, untrue smears from elected Democrats,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to POLITICO. “ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism. Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens.”

The Trump administration opposes states and cities that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities, which are colloquially referred to as “sanctuary” jurisdictions — although it is not a legal term.

The centerpiece of the three-bill package would codify into state law the Murphy administration’s statewide practice — known as the Immigrant Trust Directive — that restricts when state and local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Another bill seeks to create “model policies” for how places like hospitals and schools, should respond to immigration enforcement; another bill would bar the state, local government and hospitals from requesting or collecting information on immigration status, with narrow exceptions.

If the bills pass the full Legislature, they would then go to Murphy’s desk with just days to act before he leaves office Jan. 20. While Murphy has said he supports his administration’s policy of limiting state and local police working with federal immigration authorities, it’s unclear if he would sign the bills. His office declined to comment on the pending legislation.

White House officials opposed the new anti-ICE efforts from New Jersey Democrats, accusing them of supporting “criminal aliens who kill” New Jerseyans. Trump administration officials have cited a recent tragedy when a man in the country without authorization — previously arrested for domestic violence — killed a mother and daughter while driving under the influence in Central Jersey.

In Trenton, some Democratic lawmakers are pushing back forcefully against ICE. Timberlake, a progressive Democrat, compared their activity to war crimes.

“What the federal government is directing ICE to carry out is wrong,” she told reporters. “I do believe, and look for a day in the future where history will speak for itself, and that those who are carrying out these illegal acts will find themselves in the same position as those who carried out the illegal acts in Nazi Germany through the Nuremberg trials.”

Democrats supportive of limiting state and local police working with federal immigration authorities argue that doing so helps public safety, since immigrants feel comfortable working with police on issues not related to immigration enforcement.

“When people go underground, it gets more dangerous for all of us, including our heroes in local and state law enforcement,” state Sen. Raj Mukherji, a Democratic and sponsor of the bills, said during a Thursday committee hearing.

Mukherji said that keeping local police out of federal immigration enforcement would ensure they would not be involved in scenarios like the Minnesota shooting.

“Now they’re killing Americans on the street. Now imagine if local police were involved in an incident like that here in New Jersey,” he said. “Should our constituents and local taxpayers be on the hook for the damages that will inevitably result from those lawsuits?”

The Immigrant Trust Directive severely limits when local police work with federal immigration authorities. For example, they cannot work on civil immigration enforcement operations or provide equipment to ICE. Progressive Democrats want to codify the directive into state law, which could be undone by a future state attorney general.

The directive also says local authorities cannot keep someone in detention just to hand them over to ICE, unless the person has been charged or convicted of a serious crime or subject to a final order of deportation.

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Lynwood, who is running in the Democratic primary for retiring Sen. Dick Durbin’s seat, said she plans to file articles of impeachment against Noem.

“She has turned ICE into a rogue force, violating the Constitution, tearing families apart, and leaving death in her wake,” Kelly said in a statement. “From Chicago to Minneapolis, her recklessness cost lives, including Renee Nicole Good. This isn’t just dangerous — it’s impeachable. I’m fighting back.”

Alongside Kelly is her Democratic primary opponent, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Schaumburg, who wrote on social media that “I’ll be your first cosponsor.”

“When federal agents are unleashed without restraint or oversight, the consequences are deadly — and the responsibility for this killing is on their hands,” he said, adding that he will be “demanding full answers and accountability from the Trump administration.”

The third leading candidate in that Senate race, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, said Noem should “resign or be removed,” adding “we won’t let you get away with this.”

Impeachment unlikely

Kelly’s impeachment push is likely symbolic at this point due to Democrats’ minority status in the U.S. House. And removal doesn’t appear likely either, as Trump and Republicans in his administration and Congress put out statements backing the ICE officer’s conduct.

Good, 37, was killed by a federal immigration agent while apparently attempting to flee a traffic stop. DHS, in a statement, said she “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted to run over agents in “an act of domestic terrorism” while the officer, “fearing for his life,” fired defensive shots.

However, multiple videos of the incident directly contradicted the Trump administration’s narrative by showing that Good was driving away from — not toward — the officer when he opened fire, raising doubts about the necessity of using lethal force.

The ICE agent later was seen on video walking around the scene with no apparent injuries, even though Trump said on social media the officer was hospitalized. Trump deemed the victim a domestic terrorist.

For Illinois’ elected leaders, there was a sense of déjà vu as the accounting of the fatal shooting echoed patterns in two shootings involving immigration officers during the height of Operation Midway Blitz in the Chicago region last year.

Silverio Villegas Gonzalez was fatally shot by ICE agents in Franklin Park in September after attempting to flee a traffic stop. As in Good’s case, DHS said that Villegas Gonzalez tried to use his vehicle as a weapon, that agents feared for their lives, acted in self-defense and were “seriously injured.” But, bodycam footage later obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times found that the ICE officers deemed their injuries as “nothing major.”

In October, Marimar Martinez was shot by a federal agent in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood. DHS called her a “domestic terrorist” who used her car as a weapon. But evidence poked holes in that narrative and federal charges against her were dropped.

‘We’ve seen this playbook before’

Gov. JB Pritzker, speaking at an unrelated bill signing Wednesday morning, said that “we’ve seen this playbook before,” casting the federal government’s version of events in Orwellian terms.

“Kristi Noem and Donald Trump have told Americans to disbelieve clear, indisputable video evidence,” Pritzker said. “They want you to question what your eyes and ears are telling you and instead blindly believe anything that they say.”

The governor then encouraged people to watch videos of the incident for themselves.

Pritzker had one other message: “It’s time for Kristi Noem to go.”

“ICE is not making Minneapolis safer — just as it did not make Chicago safer,” U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said, calling the shooting “horrific” and saying the agency’s behavior “needs to stop.”

Durbin, in a statement, said that “a full investigation must be completed so the truth can be revealed.”

“Video of the incident starkly contradicts DHS’ narrative, and the fact that DHS has jumped to characterize this shooting in ‘self-defense’ is rushed, at best, and a lie, at worst,” he said.

Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on his Republican counterparts to issue a subpoena to compel Noem to testify before the committee.

Noem is one of the faces of the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. She made several appearances in Illinois during Midway Blitz, the campaign DHS says resulted in the arrests of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission.

But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.",https://i0.wp.com/capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Noem-ICE-JA-2-2.jpg?fit=1140%2C760&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-09 04:57:07.514706

Tragic death

What they're saying:

Immigration attorney Brandon Vesely said Good's death was tragic but predictable given the increased presence of ICE agents in communities across the country.

""It's heartbreaking, and it's horrible, and it's, and I think I agree with what others just said that it's not surprising when our government decides to kind of unleash the military and our cities is kind of a predictable result,"" said Vesely.

A small group of protesters from the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity demonstrated in front of ICE headquarters in San Francisco.

Amy Argenal from the Rapid Response Network in Santa Cruz said the killing was a jolt to the rapid responder community, but she said there is a constant threat to them and to the immigrants whom they're protecting.

""I mean, I think we're always cautious and thinking about safety, but you know what, this administration they can do anything at any time, and we're seeing that domestically,"" Argenal said. ""We're seeing it internationally, and so I'm not necessarily more fearful now.""

Violence hits home

In the South Bay, many of the rapid response network said they're speaking from personal experience. ""This violence is not distant. It is happening here in California,"" said Yesenia Campos from the Rapid Response Network in Santa Clara County. ""It is happening here in San Jose.""

""I am not speaking about the silence from a distance,"" said Campos. ""I was detained by ICE here in San Jose during a legal observation.""

But they say the immigrants they hope to protect are more likely to face violence.

""Here in Santa Clara County we have seen it. I've already seen the consequences of ICE's, violent and reckless enforcement tactics,"" said Stephanie Jayne from the Rapid Response Network in Santa Clara County.

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department.
He said he met with one Burien man detailed by immigration enforcement agents while taking his kid to school.
The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP.
But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.","More than a half dozen years after Washington began limiting access to driver’s license data for immigration enforcement, federal officials were still using the information for immigration arrests as recently as late last year, a report released Thursday shows.

And despite the state implementing new restrictions twice last year, some immigration authorities still have access to driver’s license data, according to state officials and the report by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Gov. Bob Ferguson stands “prepared to take further action,” according to a 10-page joint statement by his office, State Patrol and Washington’s Department of Licensing. But the statement said the governor “will do so with reason and care.”

“Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety,” the statement continued.

The UW center report documented nine cases of immigration arrests between August and November last year that followed queries by federal agents to Nlets, a national computer system that allows law enforcement agencies to access state driver’s license data, criminal history and other information stored throughout the country. Such queries, in Washington, go through a State Patrol platform called ACCESS, which acts as a “switch” to send information back to Nlets and the requesting parties, according to the UW report and state officials.

The Seattle Times, separately, obtained information about another case – the widely publicized arrest of Kirkland high school theater manager Fernando Rocha – indicating federal agents queried Nlets for state licensing information six times before his arrest last July.

Officials can enter a driver’s license number into Nlets and retrieve the registered owner’s information, including their home address, date of birth, height and hair color. They can also get a photo. Officials can then check that information against Department of Homeland Security data for alleged immigration violations and use the data to verify or identify targets for arrest, according to the UW report.

In several cases tracked by the UW center through public disclosure documents and ICE records, federal agents looked up information on a truck or van, then followed the vehicle and made a traffic stop leading to an arrest.

Federal agents queried Nlets about one man’s license plate after he left a Latino grocery story, saying in reports they were “performing systems checks on vehicles moving near the location of a targeted subject,” according to the report. They determined he lacked authorization to be in the U.S. and arrested him. The man later told UW researchers he had been pistol-whipped, tased and pepper-sprayed in his eyes as he was arrested.

Such arrests, aided by state licensing information, have turned roads into immigration enforcement “hunting grounds,” the UW report says.

Washington’s attempt to limit driver’s license information sharing started in 2018, after the Seattle Times revealed that the Department of Licensing was routinely giving out data to immigration agents directly by email. Then-Gov. Jay Inslee halted the practice.

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department. A King 5 investigation led the state in August to revoke U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to that system. That still left Nlets as a point of access.

Dozens of Democratic elected officials, including U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden from Oregon, sounded an alarm about immigration enforcement implications of Nlets late last year. Washington officials, in their joint statement, said the state cut off ICE’s access to Nlets on Nov. 19.

But Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, director of the UW center, said she was told in writing last month by a State Patrol spokesperson that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division, which investigates criminal activity such as drugs and weapons smuggling, continued to have access to Nlets.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has access to the system and conducted eight of the nine queries documented by Godoy’s center. Seven of the nine cases involved civil immigration violations rather than criminal activity, according to the report.

The state is now reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, according to the officials’ joint statement, which also presented reasons why the agency’s continued access might be important. CBP might, for instance, use Nlets “to find out that the man about to board a plane with a small child is wanted for human trafficking,” the statement said

It added that queries do not reveal the purpose data is sought and therefore objected to suggestions in the UW report that state officials are actively participating in civil immigration enforcement. The statement called parts of a draft report reviewed by state officials “misleading” and “incendiary.”

At a news conference Thursday, Godoy and other immigrant advocates nevertheless presented the state’s role in sharing driver’s license information as a betrayal of public trust and a violation of a 2019 state law that limits most forms of state cooperation with immigration enforcement.

”Washington has long said it is a welcoming state,” said Burien City Councilmember Hugo Garcia, who, like others, pointed out that the state was the first in the country to allow all residents driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status. But faith in the state collapses, he said, “when state systems are used directly or indirectly to aid immigration enforcement.”

Noting he is an immigrant himself and speaking initially in Spanish at the news conference, held the day after an ICE official fatally shot a woman in Minnesota and the same day two people were allegedly shot by federal immigration agents in Portland, Garcia said many immigrants are feeling “fear that something as ordinary as driving to work, taking your kids to schools or picking up groceries, could lead to detention or separation from your family.

He said he met with one Burien man detailed by immigration enforcement agents while taking his kid to school. The child walked home alone afterwards.

Advocates called for a comprehensive way to end information sharing with immigration officials, rather than partial measures, though how to do so isn’t totally clear.

The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP. (Washington officials’ statement said New York has only partially stopped CBP access.) But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.

Under President Donald Trump, many federal agencies have been drafted to work on immigration enforcement. Information about Rocha, the Kirkland theater manager, obtained through public disclosure appears to show the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted one Nlets search, along with others conducted by ICE and CBP.

The UW report also suggested a technical configuration that would limit Nlets searches in Washington to data from enhanced driver’s licenses, which are held only by U.S. citizens.

In their joint statement, Washington officials cited historic challenges to limiting Nlets access, including lawsuits and threats to federal funding. Officials did not respond to an email asking whether those challenges still exist.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-09 01:57:41.885680

In a post on X, DHS said the passenger in the vehicle was from Venezuela and illegally in the United States and affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring. DHS said the person had also been involved in a shooting in Portland.

""When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents. Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene,"" DHS said.

The FBI said it is investigating the shooting.

The shooting happened outside the Adventist Health clinic near Southeast Main Street at around 2:20 p.m. The two wounded people drove more than 2.5 miles to Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside, where they were found and taken to the hospital.

Portland police said their officers were called to the area of the clinic where said they confirmed federal agents were involved in a shooting. They said they were not involved in the shooting.

The condition of the two people who were shot wasn’t immediately known but Portland City Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said as far as she knew they were still alive.

Portland police said at 2:24 p.m., they had learned that a man who had been shot called to request help near Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside. Arriving officers found a man and a woman wounded from apparent gunshot wounds. Police confirmed federal agents were involved.

The two people who were wounded were taken to the hospital.

Residents in the area told KATU that a red Toyota truck was driven to an apartment complex. A man at the scene said he saw the wounded man stopped in the truck, who then got out and was bleeding.

FBI agents were seen collecting evidence from the scene. At about 6:35 p.m., a tow truck towed the truck away and all law enforcement left the area.

Mayor Calls For An End Of ICE Operations in Portland

The shooting in Portland came a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, rattling city leaders in Portland.

In a statement shortly after the shooting was confirmed, Mayor Keith Wilson called on the Trump administration to end Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the city until an independent investigation into the shooting could be completed. He restated the demand in a news conference flanked by other city leaders, city councilors, Multnomah County commissioners, the county sheriff, the city police chief, state lawmakers, faith leaders and the governor of the state.

“When the [Trump] administration talks about using full force, we are seeing what it means on our streets. The consequences are not abstract. They are felt in hospital rooms and living rooms, in the quiet moments when families try to make sense of what happened, what is happening,"" Wilson said. ""We know what the federal government said happened here. There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time has long passed.""

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek echoed the sentiment that the trust between the federal government and local leaders had been broken. She also called for an independent investigation.

“The priority right now is a full, completed investigation, not more detentions,"" Kotek said. ""My message to the federal government is this we demand transparency. We demand your cooperation with Portland police and the Multnomah County DA, because we need to investigate this incident efficiently and effectively so we can rebuild trust with our nation's government.”

During that news conference, a large group of people gathered outside City Hall to protest the shooting.

Portland City Councilor Sameer Kanal expressed frustration and anger. His sentiment echoed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s criticism of ICE when one of its agents killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in that city on Wednesday. Frey told ICE to “get the f***” out of his city.

“You are hearing and you are seeing attempts to justify the unjustifiable, to completely defend the indefensible from our federal government,” Kanal told the people gathered outside Portland City Hall. “It’s unacceptable. We’re going to stand against it. We see through your bullshit.”

He said his thoughts were with those in hospitals and in detention, and he said he stood in solidarity with Good’s family and loved ones, as well as with the Minneapolis community.

Late Thursday night, a large group of people gathered at the ICE facility in South Portland. The facility has been the site of protest against ICE activities since last June.

Portland police and state troopers responded to the facility. Portland police used a public address system to order people to disperse. Several people were taken into custody.

Watch the live video:

The FBI said on social media that it is investigating the shooting but it appeared it later deleted its posted on X. FBI agents were seen at the site of the shooting.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, posted on X, urging people to keep any protests of the Trump administration peaceful.

""Trump wants to generate riots. Don't take the bait,"" he wrote.

City Councilors Shaken

Portland city councilors were holding its meeting Thursday night when suddenly they adjourned. A KATU reporter covering the meeting said the councilors rushed to the fourth floor where the mayor’s office is located.

The reporter learned from protesters at the meeting who were there to protest federal actions that a shooting involving federal agents had happened.

KATU immediately began working to confirm the information.

At 3:40 p.m., city councilors reconvened in the council chambers and announced they had learned federal agents had someone.

“I’m sorry to be delivering this news today,” Pirtle-Guiney said upon reconvening the meeting. “We are all holding both Ms. Good’s family and the families of these Portlanders. As we sit here as far as we know, both of these individuals are still alive, and we are hoping for more positive updates.”

This is a breaking news story and will be updated when more information becomes available.

With its access to the case materials, witnesses and evidence revoked, the BCA said it had to “reluctantly” withdraw from the investigation.
The agent was identified independently by the Guardian as Jonathan E Ross, a Minnesota resident and 10-year veteran of federal law enforcement.
“We will never accept that a single federal agent can be judge, jury and executioner in our streets,” the Minnesota representative said.
This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the name of the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good, which is Jonathan E Ross, not Jonathan David Ross.","The FBI has taken full control of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) officer in Minneapolis, it emerged on Thursday.

In a statement, the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA) said it was initially called upon to help investigate the shooting before federal officials “reversed course” and said the case would be “solely led by the FBI”. With its access to the case materials, witnesses and evidence revoked, the BCA said it had to “reluctantly” withdraw from the investigation.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem denied that the BCA had been cut out of the investigation and said it was a matter of jurisdiction. “They have not been cut,” she said. “They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”

But Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, told a news conference that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation. It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome. And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment.”

Indeed, the reversal from federal law enforcement comes as the Trump administration continues to justify Wednesday’s deadly shooting by accusing Good of engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” and claiming that the ICE agent who shot her was acting in “self-defense”, alleging she had tried to run him over.

That narrative is at odds with video footage of the incident, which has been widely shared online. It shows Good reversing her car and letting at least one ICE vehicle pass before an officer tells her to get out of the car; she then tries to turn and drive away. An agent shoots her multiple times, remains on his feet and walks away apparently uninjured as her car crashes into a lamp-post and parked vehicle.

The agent was identified independently by the Guardian as Jonathan E Ross, a Minnesota resident and 10-year veteran of federal law enforcement. Noem continued on Thursday to defend the federal agent – whom she described as “an experienced officer” that was “following his training” – and said he had been treated in hospital after the incident. Both she and the vice-president noted that Ross had been injured in an incident six months ago when an undocumented immigrant resisted arrest in a vehicle.

Vance also defended the shooting, repeatedly claiming, baselessly, that Good was part of a “leftwing network” of people who are trying to “incite violence against our law enforcement officers”.

He told the White House press briefing without evidence that the young mother was “a victim of leftwing ideology” and had been “brainwashed”, and doubled down on the administration’s claim that the officer had acted in self-defense. Good, 37, was “dead because she tried to ram somebody with her car”, Vance said.

The deadly incident, which occurred less than a mile from the spot where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020, escalated tensions that have been building for weeks in Minnesota amid ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations and fraud investigations by the Trump administration.

Authorities in Minneapolis had canceled school classes across the city on Thursday amid safety concerns and rising political tension after the US citizen and mother of three was killed during a large-scale immigration enforcement operation the day before.

Dozens of clergy members from all faith backgrounds gathered with hundreds of people at the site of the shooting in south Minneapolis at noon to show that the city was unified in its response. “Renee Good stood for her neighbors. We now must stand for her,” said JaNaé Bates, a co-executive director of the interfaith group Isaiah.

The crowd chanted “ICE out now” throughout the event, against visible signs of the tragedy: red paint in the snow read “ICE kills”, and writing on the street called for ICE to leave.

But emotions remained high in the city, and across the US, as the basic facts of the incident remain the subject of fierce debate.

Ilhan Omar posted on social media Thursday morning that thousands of people had gathered to honor Good last night, and that “ICE needs to get out of Minneapolis”.

“We will never accept that a single federal agent can be judge, jury and executioner in our streets,” the Minnesota representative said.

Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, also made several appearances on television networks on Wednesday night calling for peaceful protests and doubling down on his comments at a press conference earlier in the day in which he called for ICE “to get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.

“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, somebody is dead,” Frey said.

He said the homeland security department was already “trying to spin this as an action of self-defense”, a claim he said was “bullshit”.

Some Republicans seized on Frey’s comments as incendiary, with Nancy Mace, a South Carolina representative, calling for the resignations of the mayor and Walz.

Despite local officials’ calls for federal law enforcement to leave the state, the New York Times reported on Thursday that the Trump administration will deploy more than 100 US Customs and Border Protection agents and officers to Minnesota following the fatal shooting of Good.

The agents will be redirected from operations in Chicago and New Orleans. The deployment is expected to last until Sunday, the newspaper reported, citing documents it obtained.

Noem also stated that ICE operations would continue in Minneapolis, which saw a surge of about 2,000 federal agents this week to target immigrant populations.

This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the name of the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good, which is Jonathan E Ross, not Jonathan David Ross. Also, an incorrect reference to Ross being a resident of Minneapolis was removed.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f563985a39c97b511b75a1230b76987d184c637b/338_0_2650_2120/master/2650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=957c931df3050fb7751c2d8cd0d510fe",N,,2026-01-09 00:11:53.795303

Sen. Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) resolution passed a key hurdle on Thursday, advancing in a 52 to 47 vote. It seeks to assert Congress’s power over the military’s aggression against Venezuela, which entered a new stage on Saturday, and bar Trump from further hostilities unless explicitly authorized by Congress.

All Democrats and five Republicans voted for resolution to advance: Senators Susan Collins (Maine), Josh Hawley (Missouri), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Kentucky), and Todd Young (Indiana).

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pennsylvania) also voted to advance the legislation, despite previous statements that he was opposed to a war powers resolution on Venezuela and his previous “no” vote on a similar resolution in October.

Republicans who voted to advance the resolution said that they voted “yes” because they oppose further escalations like a ground invasion, even if they do support the illegal abduction of Maduro.

“With regard to Venezuela, my read of the Constitution is that if the President feels the need to put boots on the ground there in the future, Congress would need to vote on it. That’s why I voted yes on this morning’s Senate resolution,” said Hawley in a post on X.

Two previous attempts to pass a war powers resolution on hostilities against Venezuela in the Senate failed.

The advancement allows the resolution to come to a vote next week. It only needs a simple majority to pass. From there, it will go to the House, where its fate is unclear — with a handful of Republicans vocally opposed to the administration’s Venezuela operations.

Even if it clears that hurdle, however, the resolution is almost certain to be vetoed by Trump, who took to Truth Social on Thursday to rail against the Republicans in the Senate who voted for its advancement.

Naming the Republicans, Trump said they “should never be elected to office again,” and complained that lawmakers sought to curb his power.

Still, the vote could show growing dissent within Congress regarding Trump’s ever-expanding operation against Venezuela, which legal experts have said is illegal at every step of escalation taken by the administration. The Trump administration has repeatedly snubbed Congress during the operation, and on Saturday, kept lawmakers in the dark even as Trump kept oil companies informed as the military carried out its attack.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/2026_01-08-venezuela-war-power.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 04:57:11.447844

Many of the local officials who spoke out compared the incident to the deadly shooting earlier this week in Minneapolis, and condemned the behavior of federal immigration enforcement agencies under the Trump administration. Several others called on the community for calm.

Portland police confirmed that officers responded to the location of Adventist Health Portland near Interstate 205 at 2:18 p.m. for reports of a shooting. Minutes later, police learned that a man who had been shot was calling to request help near Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside.

Police responded to both scenes and found a man and a woman with apparent gunshot wounds at the second location. Both patients were taken to a hospital, and police confirmed they were connected to the shooting and that it involved federal agents.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek

Remarks at Thursday evening news conference:

We are standing here today united as a state, wanting peace and safety in our communities. We are all shaken and outraged by another terrible, unnecessary, violent event instigated by the reckless agenda of the Trump administration — this time in our own state, in our largest city, coming just one day after the tragedy in Minnesota.

While the details of the incident remain limited, one thing is very clear: when a president endorses tearing families apart and attempts to govern through fear and hate rather than shared values, you foster an environment of lawlessness and recklessness. Trust is essential to maintaining community safety and the rule of law. Federal agents, at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security, are shattering trust. They are hurting people and they are destroying, day by day, what we hold dear.

Our sense of safety, and our literal safety, are severely undermined by what happened this afternoon in Portland. I'm so thankful that no one died and more people weren't hurt. The attorney general and other leaders have been clear about our concerns with the excessive use of force by federal agents in Portland, and today's incident only heightens the need for transparency and accountability.

Oregonians deserve clear answers, and I am aligned with the mayor; the priority right now is a full, completed investigation, not more detentions. My message to the federal government is this: we demand transparency, we demand your cooperation with Portland police and the Multnomah County DA, because we need to investigate this incident efficiently and effectively so we can rebuild trust with our nation's government.

There are those who want to cause chaos, but Oregonians know how to stand up and speak out peacefully. We must remain united in peaceful opposition to efforts to tear our community apart. We must not turn against each other. We must stand neighbor to neighbor. We must not take the bait.

And I want to end by saying I'm grateful to the first responders who have been managing this incident today here in Portland, and I stand and we stand united with Americans across our country and with Minneapolis and Minnesota in light of these very troubling events.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson

Statement via press release:

Just one day after the horrific violence in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents, our community here in Portland is now grappling with another deeply troubling incident. Earlier this afternoon, two people were shot and injured by federal agents in the Hazelwood neighborhood.

We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts. Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences. As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.

Federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents' civil and human rights.

I call on every Portlander to represent our values and to show up with calm and purpose during this difficult time. Portland does not respond to violence with violence. We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice. We must stand together to protect Portland.

The City of Portland will continue to provide updates as they become available. We are grateful to our first responders for their support of the victims.

Portland Metro Councilors

Joint statement via news release:

Twice in two days, in two cities that stand in staunch opposition to the Trump administration’s agenda, federal agents have used deadly force against members of the public.

These federal agents are not making us safer. They are creating a climate of fear. And where that climate of fear has existed for immigrant communities since these increased enforcement actions started a year ago, it is now hitting home for all of us.

We all – as Oregonians, as patriotic Americans – must oppose this violence. We cannot allow this to become normalized and must peacefully condemn this violence at every opportunity.

We also must continue to stand together, united peacefully for change. Violent actions, including damaging property, do nothing to address the real issue here, but violent actions do cause harm and fear to our fellow Oregonians. There are some who are seeking to provoke chaos – we cannot take their bait.

Instead, we must focus on justice – a just society that protects the rights and freedom of all. The investigation of today’s incident, in pursuit of trust and justice, must include local law enforcement officials.

The Metro Council has worked, and will continue to work, to support those affected by the Trump administration’s ongoing violence against our neighbors. Those who lost a loved one in Minnesota are in our thoughts, and those who are worried about their loved ones shot by federal agents here are in our thoughts. We send our thanks to those who responded to the victims and to everyone who will demonstrate our values peacefully in the hours and days to come.

Metro Council President Lynn Peterson

Councilor Ashton Simpson

Councilor Christine Lewis

Councilor Gerritt Rosenthal

Councilor Juan Carlos González

Deputy Council President Duncan Hwang

Oregon Senate Majority Leader Kayse Jama, Reps. Andrea Valderrama and Lamar Wise

Joint statement via news release:

Let’s be clear: the violence carried out today by federal agents in Portland is a predictable escalation of the lawlessness and recklessness we have seen from the Trump administration. Federal agents opened fire in the Hazelwood neighborhood. That is not public safety; it is a dangerous and unacceptable use of force by a federal agency operating without accountability.

We stand in solidarity with all Portlanders seeking justice. Our communities are not collateral damage. Residents should not have to fear armed federal agents escalating violence in their neighborhoods. This incident reflects a broader pattern: an administration that prioritizes intimidation over constitutional rights, violence over public safety, and suffering over human dignity.

This was an abuse of power, plain and simple. We stand with the Mayor of Portland and demand that federal agents immediately cease terrorizing neighborhoods in our city and that these actions are fully investigated. Portland does not consent to federal agents bringing violence into our neighborhoods.”

Portland City Councilors Candace Avalos, Jamie Dunphy and Loretta Smith

Joint statement via news release:

Today ICE shot two of our East Portland neighbors – just one day after an ICE agent shot and killed a Minneapolis mother. We are still waiting for more information at this time, but this is part of a pattern of violence that we have seen too many times across our country.

ICE in our communities does not make us safe. It should be crystal clear to everyone that the real threat to community safety is the ICE agents harassing, targeting, detaining — and in some tragic cases — killing our neighbors. This violence is unacceptable, it is criminal, and it is against the constitution of the United States.

This federal government is going to spin the story like they do every time one of their agents hurts a community member. We saw that when they tried to send in the National Guard. It's on all of us to keep speaking the truth, to keep on bearing witness, because our community's voices outweigh their lies every time. It's up to each and every one of us to keep us safe.

As your East Portland councilors, we have stood united to protect Portlanders from aggressive immigration enforcement and federal overreach and we will continue to do everything in our power to keep our communities safe. We are asking our counterparts at every level of government to do the same.

We thank our first responders for their swift response. We're holding the two victims and their families in our hearts at this time and our offices will provide more information when it is available.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day

Statement via news release:

We are still in the early stages of this incident. We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.

Multnomah County Board of Commissioners

Joint statement from Chair Jessica Vega Pederson and Commissioners Meghan Moyer, Shannon Singleton, Julia Brim-Edwards and Vince Jones-Dixon via news release:

This afternoon, federal Customs and Border Protection agents shot two people in East Portland. We are in close coordination with our government partners and law enforcement to learn everything we can, and encourage patience in sharing information to ensure accuracy. We are holding the families and communities of those impacted in our thoughts.

What we can say now is enough is enough. The terror and violence ICE is causing in our neighborhoods must end now. The County will not stand by as the federal government attacks our neighbors. We stand united in our support for our immigrant and refugee neighbors. Just this morning, we unanimously voted to extend an emergency declaration in response to the ongoing harm caused by ICE activity, and we will keep showing up every way we can.

We know County residents are angry. We are angry. Portlanders have a proud tradition of opposing injustice through nonviolent protest, and we encourage our community to keep showing up as they have been to oppose this horrific violence. We must stand together.

Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vazquez

Remarks during media huddle at the shooting scene:

We are here from the District Attorney's office to monitor and to assist and to make sure that there's a thorough and complete investigation, that evidence is fully preserved, and that we're certainly hoping that we can get all of the facts about what transpired here today. And we will work to update the public as we go forward and get more information.

Right now, I don't have a lot to say about [who is leading the investigation] as this investigation is starting to unfold, and certainly the different agencies involved are coming together. But we are working closely with Portland police and the FBI, certainly, is here, and we're making sure that they have all the resources that they need, and of course our priority and main concern is that there's a thorough and complete investigation and that all facts that can be learn are obtained, and that we can get as much information as possible.

I think the message to the community is that local officials are very carefully monitoring this, and we're making sure that the interests of the this community are well-represented and that this investigation is done in a thorough and complete manner.

Multnomah County Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O'Donnell

Statement via news release:

The use of deadly force by law enforcement weighs heavily on all of us who serve.

I am monitoring the situation that occurred this afternoon in Southeast Portland. The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office was not involved in the shooting, nor were we on scene when it happened.

My thoughts are with those who were injured during this shooting, their families, and anyone who witnessed it.

Moments like this can create even greater fear and I recognize the weight of emotion our country and now our community is carrying right now.

This investigation is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office is here to keep people safe. This is a tense and emotional moment, but our commitment remains the same. MCSO deputies will continue to respond with professionalism and care for everyone in our community.

As Sheriff, I support the community’s right to peacefully and lawfully assemble. If people choose to gather, we ask that it be done lawfully and safely. As a community, we must commit to responses that heal rather than destroy. MCSO stands ready to support the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) to advance public safety.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield

Statement via news release:

We are deeply troubled by reports that two people were shot and injured in Portland today during an incident involving federal agents. We have been clear about our concerns with the excessive use of force by federal agents in Portland, and today’s incident only heightens the need for transparency and accountability. Oregonians deserve clear answers when people are injured in their neighborhoods.

Our office is closely monitoring this situation and will take appropriate action to protect the rights and safety of Oregonians as more facts come to light. We also encourage community members to review the Oregon DOJ Immigration Services & Support Resources toolkit to understand their rights and available resources during federal enforcement activity.

ICE has done nothing but inject terror, chaos, and cruelty into our communities. Trump’s immigration machine is using violence to control our communities—straight out of the authoritarian playbook. ICE must immediately end all active operations in Portland.

I will share more updates as they become available. I am demanding full accountability and transparency. I encourage our community to stay calm and show courage in this moment.

Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur.","Minneapolis is once again the focus of debates about violence involving law enforcement after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, in her car.

The incident quickly prompted dueling narratives. Trump administration officials defended the shooting as justified, while local officials condemned it.

The shooting will also likely prompt renewed scrutiny of training and policy of officers and the question of them shooting at moving vehicles. There has been a recent trend in law enforcement toward policies that prohibit such shootings. It is a policy shift that has shown promise in saving lives.

Decades ago, the New York City Police Department prohibited its officers from shooting at moving vehicles. That led to a drop in police killings without putting officers in greater danger.

Debates over deadly force are often contentious, but as I note in my research on police ethics and policy, for the most part there is consensus on one point: Policing should reflect a commitment to valuing human life and prioritizing its protection. Many use-of-force policies adopted by police departments endorse that principle.

Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur. Not all agencies have implemented prohibitions on shooting at vehicles. Even in agencies that have, some policies are weak or ambiguous.

In addition, explicit prohibitions on shooting at vehicles are largely absent from the law, which means that officers responsible for fatal shootings of drivers that appear to violate departmental policies still often escape criminal penalties.

In the case of ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, its policy on shooting at moving vehicles – unlike that of many police agencies – lacks a clear instruction for officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. It’s an omission at odds with generally recognized best practices in policing.

ICE’s policy on shooting at moving vehicles

ICE’s current use-of-force policy prohibits its officers from “discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle” unless it is necessary to stop a grave threat. The policy is explicit that deadly force should not be used “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”

That point is relevant for evaluating the fatal shooting in Minneapolis. Videos show one officer trying to open the door of the vehicle that Good was driving, while another officer appears to be in front of the vehicle as she tried to pull away.

Shooting to prevent the driver simply from getting away would have been in violation of agency policy and obviously inconsistent with prioritizing the protection of life.

ICE’s policy lacks clear instruction, however, for its officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. In contrast, the Department of Justice’s use-of-force policy makes it explicit that officers should not shoot at a vehicle if they can protect themselves by “moving out of the path of the vehicle.”

Notably, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2022 requiring federal law enforcement agencies – like ICE – to adopt use-of-force policies “that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements” of the Department of Justice’s policy.

Despite that order, the provision to step out of the way of moving cars never made it into the use-of-force policy that applies to ICE.

The rationale for not shooting at moving vehicles

Prioritizing the protection of life doesn’t rule out deadly force. Sometimes such force is necessary to protect lives from a grave threat, such as an active shooter. But it does rule out using deadly force when less harmful tactics can stop a threat. In such cases, deadly force is unnecessary – a key consideration in law and ethics that can render force unjustified.

That’s the concern involved with police shooting at moving vehicles. It often is not necessary because officers have a less harmful option to avoid a moving vehicle’s threat: stepping out of the way.

This guidance has the safety of both suspects and police in mind. Obviously, police not shooting lowers the risk of harm to the suspect. But it also lowers the risk to the officer in the vast majority of cases because of the laws of physics. If you shoot the driver of a car barreling toward you, that rarely brings a car to an immediate stop, and the vehicle often continues on its path.

Many police departments have incorporated these insights into their policies. A recent analysis of police department policies in the 100 largest U.S. cities found that close to three-quarters of them have prohibitions against shooting at moving vehicles.

The gap between policy and best practices for protecting life

The shooting in Minneapolis serves as a stark reminder of the stubborn gap that often persists between law and policy on the one hand and best law enforcement practices for protecting life on the other. When steps are taken to close that gap, however, they can have a meaningful impact.

Some of the most compelling examples involve local, state and federal measures that reinforce one another. Consider the “fleeing felon rule,” which used to allow police to shoot a fleeing felony suspect to prevent their escape even when the suspect posed no danger to others.

That rule was at odds with the doctrine of prioritizing the protection of life, leading some departments to revise their use-of-force policies and some states to ban the rule. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for police to shoot a fleeing suspect who was not a danger.

Banning that questionable tactic notably led to a reduction in killings by police.

This history suggests that clear bans in law and policy on questionable tactics have the potential to save lives, while also strengthening the means for holding officers accountable.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/711506/original/file-20260108-56-abr8f9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C42%2C3500%2C1750&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 01:12:30.980482

(AP) — Federal immigration officers shot and wounded two people in a vehicle outside a hospital in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday, a day after an officer shot and killed a driver in Minnesota, authorities said.

The Department of Homeland Security described the vehicle’s passenger as “a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring” who had been involved in a recent shooting in Portland. When agents identified themselves to the occupants during a “targeted vehicle stop” Thursday afternoon, the driver tried to run them over, the department said in a written statement.

“Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,” the statement said. “The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.”

There was no immediate independent corroboration of that account or of any gang affiliation of the vehicle’s occupants. During prior shootings involving agents involved in President Donald Trump’s surge of immigration enforcement in U.S. cities, including Wednesday’s shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, video evidence cast doubt on the administration’s descriptions of what prompted the shootings.

Trump and his allies have consistently blamed Tren de Aragua for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities.

The shooting escalates tensions in an city that has long had a contentious relationship with President Donald Trump, including Trump’s recent, failed effort to deploy National Guard troops in the city. Trump’s decision to send militarized personnel into U.S. cities to conduct immigration enforcement drew long-running nightly protests outside the ICE building in Portland.

According to the Portland Police bureau, officers initially responded to a report of a shooting outside Adventist Health hospital at about 2:18 p.m. Thursday.

A few minutes later, police received information that a man who had been shot was asking for help in a residential area a couple of miles away. Officers then responded there and found a man and a woman with gunshot wounds. Officers determined they were injured in the shooting with federal agents, police said.

Their conditions were not immediately known. Portland police said officers applied a tourniquet to one of the wounded. Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney said during a Portland city council meeting that “as far as we know both of these individuals are still alive and we are hoping for more positive updates throughout the afternoon.”

At a news conference Thursday night, Portland Police Chief Bob Day said the FBI was leading the investigation and that he had no details about the events that led to the shooting.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and the city council called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end all operations in Oregon’s largest city until a full investigation is completed.

“We stand united as elected officials in saying that we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” a joint statement said. “Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences.”

Wilson also suggested at a news conference that he didn’t necessarily believe the federal government’s account of the shooting: “There was a time we could take them at their word. That time is long past.”

Democratic State Sen. Kayse Jama, who lives near the shooting scene, said Oregon is a welcoming state — but he told federal agents to leave.

“You are not welcome,” Jama said. ”You need to get the hell out of Oregon.”

The city officials said “federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. We’ll use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”

They urged residents to show up with “calm and purpose during this difficult time.”

“We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice,” the statement said. “We must stand together to protect Portland.”

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, urged any protesters to remain peaceful.

The nonprofit tracks the flights through its ICE Flight Monitor using publicly available aviation data, according to its website.
That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights.
The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said.
Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025.","Avelo Airlines will end its contract with the airline broker hired by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and stop its deportation flights by Jan. 27, spokesperson Courtney Goff told The Nevada Independent Tuesday.

The budget, Houston-based airline operated the majority of the 124 ICE-chartered flights that stopped at Las Vegas’ Harry Reid International Airport in 2025, according to new data shared exclusively with The Indy by the immigrant- and refugee-focused nonprofit Human Rights First. That’s more than double the 60 ICE-chartered flights that passed through Las Vegas in 2024.

Of last year’s flights, 74, or nearly 3 of 5, were operated by Avelo, which ceased commercial operations in Las Vegas in August.

Goff said Avelo’s contract “provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.”

It is unclear why deportation flights stop in Nevada and if the planes pick up detainees held in detention centers in the state. ICE discloses little information about the flights’ passengers or paths, multiple immigration experts told The Indy.

ICE representatives did not respond to requests for comment from The Indy.

Federal immigration authorities use the flights to transfer detainees between detention centers and major deportation facilities and to deport detainees.

Some detainees are placed on multiple domestic flights before being sent to deportation facilities in a process Human Rights First refers to as the domestic “shuffle.”

The Obama and Biden administrations also shuffled detainees around the country, but the pace of such flights has increased dramatically under the Trump administration. The ICE Flight Monitor counted more than 7,300 domestic shuffle flights between Jan. 20 and Nov. 30, 2025, a 114 percent increase compared with the number of shuffle flights during the same period in 2024.

The Los Angeles Times reported in September 2025 that detainees were being transferred at much higher rates under the second Trump administration than under Biden, with twice as many detainees being transferred at least four times compared with in 2024.

How deportation flights work

Deportation flights are notoriously difficult to track and the process has grown even more opaque under the second Trump administration, said Savi Arvey, director of research and analysis at Human Rights First.

The nonprofit tracks the flights through its ICE Flight Monitor using publicly available aviation data, according to its website.

Arvey told The Indy that while the Biden administration also kept data on deportation flights secret, it was generally more forthcoming when detainees were removed to foreign countries.

ICE contracts its air operations through the company CSI Aviation, which in turn subcontracts operations to 10 airline carriers. Although federal immigration agents are usually onboard, flights are primarily staffed by the airlines’ civilian crews.

At least some of the airlines with deportation contracts, including Avelo, have removed their logos from aircraft used to transport detainees, leaving only tail numbers as identification. The airlines have also utilized a federal aviation law that allows them to block certain planes from appearing on flight tracking websites.

That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights. Human Rights First’s flight monitor relies on a “very complex process that took us a long time to learn,” said Arvey.

Beyond the lack of public transparency over flight patterns, immigration experts told The Indy that detainees often have no idea where they are going and whether they are being sent to another domestic facility or being permanently deported.

“This can make people terrified,” said Michael Kagan, a UNLV professor who directs the university’s immigration law clinic. “ICE moves people with no warning. Lawyers aren’t told. Family isn’t told. … They’ll even sometimes reverse the move and bring people back to the first detention center with no explanation.”

Kagan also said ICE fails to regularly update its detainee locator.

Relocations make it harder for detainees to secure adequate legal representation, Kagan said. Sometimes detainees are transferred out of state before lawyers can complete their intake requirements, he said, and some states have residency requirements for legal filings that make it impossible for detainees to secure consistent representation.

“It’s definitely not what you would do if you wanted fair procedures and to make sure the law is applied correctly,” he said.

Lucas Guttentag, a professor at Stanford Law School who tracks federal immigration policy, told The Indy he believes the increase in domestic transfers is part of “the public spectacle and private terror of the Trump administration’s actions.”

The purpose of domestic shuffles, he argued, “is to frighten people about enforcement actions.”

Last year, both ProPublica and The American Prospect reported on allegations by multiple flight attendants of inadequate security and safety measures on ICE-chartered flights, including federal agents forcing detainees to remain handcuffed while in the air and failing to check detainees’ luggage before takeoff.

Airports also have little information about or control over deportation flights.

Harry Reid International Airport spokesperson Monika Bertaki told The Indy that they do not receive advance notice of ICE-chartered flights and do not receive information on passengers onboard. “Armed federal agents that are on airport property” do trigger additional security measures, she said.

The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said. Neither of those companies responded to The Indy’s requests for comment.

Of ICE’s partner airlines, Avelo is sole commercial operation

In May 2025, Avelo announced it had agreed to operate deportation flights, becoming the first — and so far only — commercial airline to do so. The other airlines that signed contracts with ICE’s flight broker are charter airlines.

Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025. Avelo-owned planes made their first immigration-related stops in Las Vegas in May 2025.

For a number of months last year, it was the only ICE-contracted airline that made stops in Las Vegas.

The Avelo-ICE partnership was criticized by Democrats nationwide, some of whom introduced legislation aiming to cut Avelo’s public funding. Critics also organized protests in or near airports to lobby against the Avelo contract and signed online pledges to boycott the company.

But Goff, the Avelo spokesperson, denied such actions were part of Avelo’s decision.

“We did not see an impact in regard to customers choosing to fly,” Goff wrote. “It was a commercial decision.”

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending beyond their allotted funding and simultaneously restricts federal employees from working on a volunteer basis.
Accordingly, the court denied the government’s motion to stay and allowed the matter to proceed during the federal shutdown.
Circuit has taken a “less sanguine view” and has denied stays on the grounds that government attorneys must comply with federal court litigation timelines.
As illustrated by the courts’ differing approaches to the Anti-Deficiency Act, federal shutdowns create significant uncertainty for clients involved in civil litigation with federal agencies or personnel.","In the wake of this country’s longest federal shutdown, federal courts were facing unprecedented decision-making whether to stay civil proceedings implicating federal employees and agencies.

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending beyond their allotted funding and simultaneously restricts federal employees from working on a volunteer basis. The Act provides, in relevant part:

An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.

31 U.S.C. § 1342 (emphasis added).

During lapses in federal funding, voluntary services are only authorized in very limited circumstances, but the parameters of the “safety of human life” or “protection of property” exceptions have not been uniformly defined nor applied across the courts.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s 2026 Contingency Plan anticipated civil litigation would be curtailed or delayed, absent cases that would substantially affect the protection of human life or property interests. Indeed, the Contingency Plan instructed federal civil litigators to “approach the courts and request that active cases, except for those in which a delay would compromise to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property, be postponed until funding is available.” Nevertheless, the Contingency Plan also seemingly deferred to federal courts whether to stay proceedings, providing:

If a court denies such a request and orders a case to continue, the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue. The Department will limit its civil litigation staffing to the minimum level needed to comply with the court’s order and to protect life and property. Receipt of summonses, pleadings and motions by mail may be delayed.

A natural tension arises between the Anti-Deficiency Act, which aims to postpone cases, and Article III of the United States Constitution, which vests federal courts with the power to decide cases and controversies within its jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. As the cases discussed below illustrate, courts over time have endeavored to strike a balance between complying with the federal law and their constitutional authority during federal shutdowns.

In 2013, the D.C. Circuit court in United States, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc. et al., contemplated whether a stay of proceedings due to a lapse in appropriations was warranted in a time-sensitive civil proceeding. 979 F.Supp.2d 33 (D.C. Cir. 2013). There, the federal government initiated the suit and sought injunctive relief to block a merger between two airline corporations. Although the government argued that the Anti-Deficiency Act only allowed employees to work in limited emergency circumstances, the court noted the time-sensitive nature of the matter, the substantial amount of money at issue, and the impact of a stay on swift resolution of the matter. Accordingly, the court denied the government’s motion to stay and allowed the matter to proceed during the federal shutdown.

During the 2019 federal shutdown, the D.C. Circuit also denied a request to stay oral argument in a civil proceeding. See Kornitzky Grp., LLC v. Elwell, 912 F.3d 637 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The concurring judges noted that the DOJ’s FY 2019 Contingency Plan, similar to the 2026 Contingency Plan, provided that if a court denies a stay, “the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.” Specifically, the concurrence observed that the federal courts uniformly denied the government’s request to stay oral arguments during the 2013 federal shutdown and the government attorneys still appeared for oral argument.

Most recently, during the 2025 federal shutdown, a federal court denied the Department of Labor’s motion to stay proceedings and suggested that the DOL carried a burden to show “good grounds for either a stay or an extension of the deadlines previously established,” which was not met. Lehman v. Dep’t of Labor, 2025 WL 2808472, *2 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 2, 2025). While the court acknowledged the limitations set forth in the Anti-Deficiency Act, it recognized a circuit split on how strictly courts adhere to the general rule that government attorneys are not authorized to work during federal shutdowns—even on a volunteer basis—absent exceptional circumstances. Whereas the Sixth Circuit has traditionally taken a more literal interpretation of the Anti-Deficiency Act—finding government attorneys may exclusively work on “emergency” matters during a federal shutdown—the D.C. Circuit has taken a “less sanguine view” and has denied stays on the grounds that government attorneys must comply with federal court litigation timelines. Id. at *1 (comparing United States v. Trevino, 7 F.4th 424, 421 n.6 (6th Cir. 2021) (“The prosecution cannot continue without expenditures[,] [and] The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits any government official from carrying out the prosecution on an unpaid, volunteer basis.”) with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. USDA, 912 F.3d 641 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (declining to stay scheduling deadlines during the 2019 federal shutdown)).

The Lehman court further explained that the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct apply to federal government attorneys who appear before the state’s courts and provide that “[w]hen ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.” Id. at *2 (quoting Mich. Rule of Prof. Conduct 1.16(c)). While non-attorney government staff are not bound by the ethical rules, the court noted the DOL publicly announced that it has staff available to meet court-imposed deadlines. Unlike in US Airways Group and Kornitzky, which focused on the type of litigation and the stage of the proceedings to warrant postponement, here, the court appeared to focus on the government’s failure to show “good grounds” for a stay or deadline extension.

The Lehman approach was subsequently followed in New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget, 2025 WL 3089495 (D. Ma. Nov. 5, 2025), wherein the court echoed that federal courts retain the power to stay litigation and the Anti-Deficiency Act “does not require that non-emergency litigation cease.” There, the substantive issue was whether the federal government defendants could properly terminate funding for a federal grant that was formerly awarded to plaintiffs. After the federal shutdown took effect, defendants requested a stay to file a reply brief while plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment was pending. The court rejected defendants’ request, weighing the parties’ competing interests and finding a stay “could allow [d]efendants to continue to terminate funding but close off [p]laintiffs’ opportunity to resolve this matter pursuant to the parties’ agreed-upon schedule.” Stated differently, the court acknowledged that a stay could lead to a procedural advantage for the federal defendants by effectively preserving a status quo that is under scrutiny.

Conversely, in Dash Markets, Inc. v. United States, 2025 WL 3502097 (W.D. N.Y. Oct. 21, 2025) the court deviated from Lehman and New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget by deferring to the Anti-Deficiency Act. There, the plaintiff sued the United States, seeking remission of $3 million in Employee Retention Credits and the government requested a stay due to the 2025 federal shutdown. While the court recognized that stays are “subject to the sound discretion of the court,” the court stated that it was “disinclined to subject [d]efendant’s counsel to the risk of violating the [Anti-Deficiency] Act” and does not find plaintiff’s “alleged financial plight to constitute a potential emergency exception to the Act.” Id. Accordingly, the government’s requested stay was granted. Id.

As illustrated by the courts’ differing approaches to the Anti-Deficiency Act, federal shutdowns create significant uncertainty for clients involved in civil litigation with federal agencies or personnel. While the current shutdown has ended, this moment demonstrates the need for practitioners and clients alike to remain vigilant in anticipating delays for future lapses in federal appropriations.

Morning Reads

Trump talks up his tariffs with Supreme Court decision looming (Cory Smith, The National News Desk) — President Donald Trump continued to talk up his tariffs on Tuesday after news broke that the Supreme Court may release opinions on Friday. “We’re getting rich because of tariffs, by the way,” the president said at a retreat with House Republicans, according to The National News Desk. “I hope everyone understands that. … We’ll have over $650 billion poured into our country, or coming in shortly, because of tariffs.”

DeSantis calls for special session on Florida 2026 redistricting (Jim Rosica and James Call, USA Today) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is calling for a special session of the Florida Legislature to be held in April as the state plans a redistricting push ahead of the 2026 elections that would make it “the latest in a series of GOP-led states heeding a push from President Donald Trump to try to create a more favorable electoral climate for his party,” according to USA Today. “DeSantis … said the state needs to wait for a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act before moving forward with new maps.” It can’t wait too long, however, unless lawmakers vote “to delay the candidate qualifying period for congressional races, currently scheduled for late April.”

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says it will close down, citing losses and labor rules (Laura Wagner and Scott Nover, The Washington Post)(Paywall) — After 240 years and a lengthy labor battle, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is shutting down. “The newspaper will print its final edition May 3, according to a statement it issued Wednesday hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied its request to stay a federal appeals court’s November order that the newspaper adhere to the terms of an earlier labor agreement with its union,” according to The Washington Post. “Recent court decisions would require the Post-Gazette to operate under a 2014 labor contract that imposes on the Post-Gazette outdated and inflexible operational practices unsuited for today’s local journalism,” the newspaper’s owner, Block Communications, wrote in the statement.

Seventh Circuit shuts down Satanic Temple challenge to Indiana abortion law (Caitlyn Rosen, Courthouse News Service) — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit from the Satanic Temple, “a nonreligious group that advocates for benevolence and empathy,” that aimed to force changes to Indiana’s 10-week abortion ban, which was enacted “in 2022, shortly after … Roe v. Wade was overturned,” according to Courthouse News Service. The Satanic Temple had contended that Indiana’s abortion law “unfairly blocks the organization from providing telemedicine abortion care” and subjects its members to “a stigmatic injury” because they are “perceived as evil” due to their support for abortion. The 7th Circuit panel held that these injuries were not concrete enough to give the Satanic Temple “standing to sue the state.”

NFL, three teams appeal to Supreme Court in coach Brian Flores’s discrimination suit (Zach Schonfeld, The Hill) — The NFL and three NFL teams have asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on a lawsuit filed by coach Brian Flores, now the defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, who contends that he participated in “sham” interviews for head coach openings in the past and that the league and teams are engaged in racial discrimination, according to The Hill. “In a petition docketed Tuesday, the NFL and the teams — the Denver Broncos, Houston Texans and New York Giants — urged the justices to reverse a ruling that would allow the case to proceed before a jury. The league says it should proceed in arbitration.”

U.S. Appeals Court Won’t Take Up Case to Resurrect 9/11 Plea Deal (Carol Rosenberg, The New York Times)(Paywall) — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit announced on Tuesday that it will not rehear a dispute over a plea deal reached between a senior Pentagon official and three people accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including the alleged mastermind of the plot, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. “Under the agreement, each would admit to his role in the plot in exchange for life sentences and avert a death-penalty trial,” according to The New York Times. Days after the deal was finalized, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III “declared it void,” which led to the current battle over whether Austin’s decision came too late. “Two military courts ruled that Mr. Austin had acted too late and that the contract was still valid. Then, in July, a three-judge panel of the appeals court sided with Mr. Austin, 2 to 1, and again nullified the deal.” The full D.C. Circuit has now declined to revisit the panel’s decision, “leaving the Supreme Court as the last place to potentially consider the question.”

A Closer Look: Monsanto Company v. Durnell

Moving forward, we plan to explore at least one petition per week, with a focus on particularly notable, unique, or interesting disputes.

At their private conference on Friday, the justices will consider taking up Monsanto Company v. Durnell, a case on Roundup weedkiller and policies governing product safety labels. Monsanto, which developed the pesticide, has asked the court to determine whether it can be held liable under state laws for not including a cancer warning on Roundup containers when such a warning was not required by – and indeed, according to the company, conflicted with – federal law. (Monsanto has also filed petitions for review in two other, very similar cases, but it has encouraged the court to grant cert in Durnell.)

The dispute is part of a “tidal wave” of lawsuits aimed at holding Monsanto liable for causing cancer. The first such cases were filed more than a decade ago, soon after the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, described glyphosate, a key Roundup ingredient, as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” Since then, the company has paid billions in damages and in settlement agreements and been acquired by Bayer, which maintains that Roundup does not cause cancer.

In its Supreme Court petitions, Monsanto urges the justices to resolve a disagreement between the federal courts of appeals that has emerged as thousands of Roundup-related cases have worked their way through the legal system. The petition asks whether Monsanto can be held liable for violating state-level labeling requirements when it believed – and, at one point, was actually told by the EPA – that it could not satisfy these requirements without violating federal labeling rules. Specifically, according to the Durnell petition, the EPA said in 2019 that changing the labels to reflect the International Agency for Research on Cancer’s claims about glyphosate would “render a pesticide ‘misbranded.’”

For his part, Durnell – who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma following his exposure to Roundup and won a jury award of $1.25 million in his failure-to-warn case against Monsanto – claims that the company was not prevented by federal law “from warning consumers that Roundup may be carcinogenic or that they should wear protective gear when spraying it.”

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed at the invitation of the court, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer agreed with Monsanto’s position, arguing that “EPA’s approval of Roundup labels without a cancer warning, combined with an EPA regulation that prohibits petitioner from adding such a warning without agency approval, preempts [Durnell’s] failure-to-warn claim.” Sauer acknowledged that the federal government took the opposite position when it weighed in on a similar petition for review in 2022, which the court later denied. Since that 2022 brief was filed, Sauer noted, a new administration has entered the White House.

Monsanto contends that “tens of thousands of claims” over Roundup “remain pending in courts across the country,” which raises the stakes of the pending petitions. We could hear as soon as Friday afternoon if the justices vote to take up the case.

Good's death follows several fatal encounters involving federal immigration agents in recent months.","Hundreds gathered on the steps of the Georgia State Capitol on Thursday night, demanding accountability in the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis.

Protesters in Atlanta described the moment as a tipping point — not only for immigration enforcement practices, but for long-standing concerns about excessive use of force in everyday community spaces.

Good, a mother, poet, and active neighbor in her south Minneapolis community, was killed during a federal immigration operation. Officials say Johnathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, fired in self-defense, claiming Good attempted to use her vehicle as a weapon.

But eyewitnesses and circulating video paint a conflicting picture, intensifying national scrutiny of ICE's tactics and raising comparisons to the 2020 killing of George Floyd, which occurred less than a mile from where Good was shot.

At Thursday's Atlanta demonstration, organizers emphasized that Good was not the subject of any arrest warrant. She was simply driving through her neighborhood when the confrontation happened.

Local voices echo national outrage

Organizers filled the Capitol steps with posters, chants, and calls for both a federal investigation and a suspension of ICE operations pending an independent review.

One Atlanta protester told CBS News Atlanta, ""Working-class people are seeing the need to mobilize. Both yesterday and today a strong crowd showed up to say that we need ICE out of our communities. We demand an end to the mass deportation machine.""

They went on to say, ""What we see is that all of these situations of violence from ICE exemplify the reason why we don't need ICE in our communities. Their brutality, the militarization of our neighbors, of our immigrant brothers and sisters... We need money for education and jobs and housing, not for these racist deportations.""

Civil rights groups: ""This action shows none of us are safe""

A coalition of civil rights and immigrant justice organizations issued a joint statement condemning Good's killing, calling it ""a violation of due process and human dignity.""

The statement emphasized that Good did not exercise any form of violence, despite ICE's claims, and called her death a ""systemic failure.""

The organizations wrote: ""Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to due process — to be free from excessive force and to be treated with dignity under the law… No law enforcement agency is above the Constitution, and the use of force must be strictly limited, transparent, and subject to accountability.""

The groups called for a full, independent investigation into the officer's actions as well as a broader review of federal enforcement protocols.

A national debate with local implications

Although the fatal shooting happened in Minneapolis, Atlanta organizers say the stakes are deeply local.

Georgia continues to expand cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies — a policy that immigrant rights groups argue heightens the risk of escalation during routine community interactions.

Good's death follows several fatal encounters involving federal immigration agents in recent months. Advocates say these incidents are part of a troubling pattern — one that echoes earlier national questions around policing, civil rights, and federal authority.

Many Atlantans who marched on Thursday night said the proximity of Good's killing to the site of George Floyd's death is impossible to ignore. Both incidents underscore the power imbalance between law enforcement and civilians during moments of rapid escalation.

What comes next

Organizers are calling on Georgia lawmakers to publicly condemn the killing and review local cooperation agreements with ICE.

National organizations are pushing for federal oversight, arguing that Good's killing represents not just a localized tragedy, but a constitutional crisis.

Their statement concludes: ""Justice requires that we protect both the rule of law and the basic rights that bind us together. We stand with Renee's family and all our communities in demanding full accountability and an independent investigation.""

Federal court hearing canceled

What we know:

A federal court hearing over a lawsuit filed by the ACLU against DHS and ICE was canceled this week hours after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in her vehicle.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit weeks before the deadly shooting.

The ACLU argued DHS and ICE are trying to intimidate, harass and threaten those who try to observe and protest ICE in Minnesota.

In the lawsuit, the ACLU asked a judge to limit ICE and other federal agents from the use of crowd control weapons like chemical irritants and flash-bang grenades.

""Our worry has been and continues to be the disproportionate reaction that we have been seeing with ICE,"" said Teresa Nelson, Legal Director of ACLU-Minnesota.

ICE operations and lawsuits

Dig deeper:

Large scale immigration operations have led to similar lawsuits in other cities where ICE agents were accused of using excessive force while responding to protests.

In Chicago, a federal judge recently noted that ICE officers do not ""receive regular training on crowd control.""

A video submitted as part of the Minnesota case shows a man being arrested during a chaotic scene in south Minneapolis last year.

The ACLU argued federal agents used overly aggressive tactics.

Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security argued that the man was the aggressor, shouting obscenities and throwing rocks at ICE agents.

The Trump Administration has made similar arguments in other cities subjected to increased immigration operations and did so again after Wednesday’s deadly shooting.

Press Secretary reacts

What they're saying:

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Democrats are ""impeding immigration enforcement operations daily"" and creating ""extremely heightened and dangerous circumstances.""

Nelson said the ACLU recognizes the need to balance legitimate law enforcement activity and the rights of people to engage in protected speech.

""There does need to be a balance and the balance right now has been tipping toward really unprecedented violence against people who are engaged in that First Amendment-protected activity,"" she said.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) will propose sweeping reforms to DHS, including requiring a warrant for arrests, banning masks during enforcement operations and requiring Border Patrol to remain at the border after an ICE officer killed a woman in Minneapolis this week, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: It's one of the biggest anti-ICE pushes by elected Democrats since the days of ""Abolish ICE"" — and less than two years after an election where Democrats feel like they got beaten badly on the immigration issue.

But the polling has shifted, with a majority of Americans saying last year that President Trump is doing ""too much"" on deportations, according to Pew.

Driving the news: Murphy, the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees DHS, is also trying to build a coalition of Democrats to insist on some restraints on DHS' authority as a condition of their support for a spending bill for the department — with funding set to lapse Jan. 30.

But Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), have already taken a shutdown at the end of the month off the table after weathering a bruising shutdown fight last fall.

Murphy and his staff are in conversations about his new bill with lawmakers from Minnesota, California and Illinois, where DHS has deployed large contingents of agents, a source familiar with the talks told Axios.

""It's hard to imagine how Democrats are going to vote for a DHS bill that funds this level of illegality and violence without constraints,"" Murphy told Axios on Thursday. ""There's gotta be some reasonable constraints.""

Murphy's proposal also would limit the use of firearms by ICE when conducting civil matters and require agents to wear identification.

Zoom out: Republicans will need a handful of Democratic votes in the Senate to pass spending bills.

A number of House Democrats also said Wednesday that the party should use the appropriations process to rein in DHS.

Yes, but: It's hard to see Republicans agreeing to Democratic demands for new constraints.

""DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,"" McLaughlin said.","MINNEAPOLIS -- As anger and outrage spilled out onto Minneapolis' streets Thursday over the fatal shooting of a woman the day before by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a new shooting by federal officers in Oregon left two people wounded and elicited more scrutiny of enforcement operations across the country.

Hundreds of people protesting the shooting of Renee Good as she tried to drive away marched in freezing rain Thursday night down one of Minneapolis' major thoroughfares chanting ""ICE out now"" and holding signs saying, ""killer ice off our streets."" Protesters earlier vented their outrage outside of a federal facility that's serving as a hub for the administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major city.

The shooting in Portland, Oregon, took place outside a hospital Thursday afternoon and the conditions of the two people wounded were not immediately known. The FBI's Portland office said it is investigating.

Just as it did following the Minneapolis shooting, the Department of Homeland Security defended the actions of the officers in Portland, saying the shooting occurred after a Venezuelan man with alleged gang ties and who was involved in a recent shooting tried to ""weaponize"" his vehicle to hit the officers. It wasn't clear yet if witness video corroborates that account.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and others in his administration have repeatedly characterized the Minneapolis shooting as an act of self-defense and cast Good as a villain, suggesting she used her vehicle as a weapon to attack the officer who shot her.

Vice President JD Vance said the shooting was justified and that Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was a ""victim of left-wing ideology.""

""I can believe that her death is a tragedy while also recognizing that it is a tragedy of her own making,"" Vance said, noting that the officer who killed her was injured while making an arrest last June.

But state and local officials and protesters rejected that characterization, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying video of the shooting shows the self-defense argument was ""garbage.""

An immigration crackdown quickly turns deadly

The shooting happened on the second day of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which Homeland Security said is the biggest immigration enforcement operation ever. More than 2,000 officers are taking part, and Noem said they have already made more than 1,500 arrests.

It provoked an immediate response in the city where police killed George Floyd in 2020, with hundreds of people turning up to the scene to vent their outrage at the ICE officers and the school district canceling classes for the rest of the week as a precaution.

Good's death - at least the fifth tied to immigration sweeps since Trump took office - has resonated far beyond Minneapolis, as protests took place or were expected this week in many large U.S. cities.

""We should be horrified,"" protester Shanta Hejmadi said. ""We should be saddened that our government is waging war on our citizens.""

Protesters blocked the street in Minneapolis where Good was shot with makeshift barricades constructed out of garbage cans, Christmas trees and canopies. People gave out coffee and water, while fires burned in metal drums to keep visitors warm.

Who will investigate?

On Thursday, the Minnesota agency that investigates officer-involved shootings said it was informed that the FBI and U.S. Justice Department would not work with the department, effectively ending any role for the state to determine if crimes were committed. Noem said the state has no jurisdiction.

""Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,"" Drew Evans, the bureau's superintendent, said.

Gov. Tim Walz publicly demanded that the state be allowed to take part, repeatedly emphasizing that it would be ""very difficult for Minnesotans"" to accept that an investigation that excludes the state could be fair.

Noem, he said, was ""judge, jury and basically executioner"" during her public comments about the confrontation.

""People in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem - have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,"" the governor said.

Frey, the mayor, told The Associated Press: ""We want to make sure that there is a check on this administration to ensure that this investigation is done for justice, not for the sake of a cover-up.""

Deadly encounter seen from multiple angles

Several bystanders captured footage of Good's killing, which happened in a neighborhood south of downtown.

The videos show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It isn't clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.

ICE officer in Minneapolis shooting identified as officer who suffered injuries during June arrest

The ICE officer who fired the shots that allegedly killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday has been identified as Jonathan Ross, according to sources and federal court records from a prior case in which Ross was injured.

The Department of Homeland Security says the officer fired on Good after she allegedly tried to ram officers with her vehicle.

In a social media post on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said the officer was ""dragged in June by a child sexual predator trying to evade an immigration enforcement arrest. He suffered severe injuries and required 33 stitches. ICE officers put their lives on the line every day to defend American communities.""

The post also links to a previous post by DHS in June when the incident occurred, identifying the suspect as Roberto Carlos Munoz. Federal court records in that case identify the ICE officer Jonathan Ross as witness in the case and include photos of his injuries. The court record also describes two separate cuts requiring 20 and 13 stitches, respectively.

When asked for comment on the identity of the ICE agent who fired the shot that allegedly killed Good, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded: ""We are not going to expose the name of this officer. He acted according to his training.""

She added, ""This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.""

Without naming the officer, she said he has more than 10 years of experience as ICE deportation officer and was selected for ICE's Special Response Team. She said the officer had training in several specialized skills, including advanced firearms training.

""DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,"" McLaughlin said. ""Doxxing our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.""

“MAGA loves it,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News this week, defending his foreign policy approach.","Five years after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by President Trump’s supporters, the White House released a website this week attempting to revise history.

Reasserting Trump’s false claim that he had won the 2020 presidential election, the administration doubled down on his decision to issue blanket pardons for the rioters, blamed Capitol Police for escalating tensions that day, and denounced Trump’s vice president at the time, Mike Pence, for “refusing to act” in defiance of the Constitution to stop congressional certification of Trump’s loss.

It was a display of political audacity that has become the hallmark of Trump’s second act — challenging anyone to stop him from asserting raw executive authority, both at home and increasingly abroad.

Whether on foreign or domestic policy, lawmakers have struggled to respond to an administration that moves with unfettered restraint and exceptional speed. The U.S. Supreme Court has only facilitated Trump’s expansion of unitary executive power. And governments abroad accustomed to Trump’s lack of predictability now face a president whose entire philosophy toward foreign interventionism appears to have turned on a dime.

“There are political checks. They are checks, though, that have been degraded,” said William Howell, dean of the School of Government and Policy at Johns Hopkins University and author of “Trajectory of Power: The Rise of the Strongman Presidency.”

“They are checks that are looked upon not just with frustration, but an outward animosity by the president,” Howell added. “It’s a feature of his populist politics for him to say, ‘anything that stands in my way is illegitimate.’”

Unitary rule

Trump’s extraordinary use of executive authority has no comparison in recent times. The president has issued more than 220 executive actions in his first year back in office — more than the 220 orders he issued throughout his entire first term, and dwarfing the 276 actions that President Obama issued over eight years in office.

Directing the Justice Department to prosecute his political enemies, and deploying his pardon power to shield his friends and allies, Trump risks fueling the very sort of politicized system of justice he campaigned against as a presidential candidate.

And his administration has shown derision for Congress, controlled by the president’s own party, approving historically few bills and neglecting those that have passed, such as the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Trump has attempted to unilaterally rename the Defense Department and the Kennedy Center, despite straightforward laws requiring acts of Congress to do so, and has impounded funds appropriated by Congress for child care and family assistance allocated to Democratic states.

“The nature of presidential power is that it is given as much as taken,” said Andrew Rudalevige, a professor of government at Bowdoin College and author of “The New Imperial Presidency.” “You can’t have an imperial presidency without an invisible Congress. And certainly, the current Congress is setting new records for intentional invisibility.”

After Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House, a reporter asked his press secretary what was stopping him from knocking down the entire building. Karoline Leavitt demurred. “That’s a legal opinion that’s been held for many years,” she said, suggesting he could, in fact, demolish the rest of it.

“The institutional constraints on the unilateral presidency are weak,” said Dino Christenson, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis and co-author of “The Myth of the Imperial Presidency.” “The conservative majority of the [Supreme] Court has also recently chosen to back executive power.

“Arguably,” he added, “international constraints are even weaker, at least for powerful nations like the U.S.”

‘Governed by force’

Trump’s order over the weekend to depose Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, seizing him and his wife from their bedroom in a stunning military raid, was the type of rare exercise in American power that has defined past presidencies. But Trump said he was just getting started.

Beaming from the operational success in Caracas, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was considering military action against no fewer than five countries, allies and foes alike. His homeland security advisor, Stephen Miller, said that no one would even try to stop Trump from militarily taking over Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark, a NATO ally and European Union member state.

“We live in a world,” Miller told CNN, “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.”

At the State Department, veteran U.S. diplomats waited anxiously for guidance from the administration on how it would justify the operation based on international law on the global stage. It never came. “At least with Iraq, Libya, Syria, there was an effort to seek legal cover,” one diplomat said, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “This is just grab-and-go.”

After the president vowed to run Venezuela going forward as a vassal state, Trump’s energy secretary said the United States would exert control over its oil production “indefinitely.”

And the Trump administration ordered the seizure of two foreign tankers on Wednesday in international waters that have violated its unilateral oil embargo against Caracas, risking precedent governing the laws of the seas that have for decades ensured international commercial flows.

It was a surprising turn for a president who had campaigned on a promise to focus on domestic policy, under a slogan of “America first.”

“So many of the claims that he was making — both in terms of his power and his politics — was about an inward turn, about standing up for America and attending to core problems that it had failed to face, whereas all these foreign entanglements were distractions to be avoided,” Howell said. “So it is striking that he has assumed this new posture of outward imperialism — land grabs, oil tankers, removing heads of state — all at once.”

Several Republican lawmakers expressed skepticism over Trump’s new posture, warning the president against entrenching the U.S. military in foreign conflicts. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, warned that U.S. military action against Denmark in Greenland “would not be appropriate” after the White House issued an explicit threat of force.

Scholars of the imperial presidency often say that public opinion — not the legislature or the courts — remains the strongest check on executive authority. Trump is ineligible for a third term in office, and has signaled in recent weeks that he recognizes that constitutional limit as unambiguous.

“I don’t think Trump is immune from the laws of political gravity,” Rudalevige said. “Despite his bluster, he is a lame duck. He has never had a Gallup approval rating above 50%, and that rating is in the 30s. His policy actions are even less popular.”

But he also said he believes the public supports him in his brash use of power, telling lawmakers there could be a “constitutional movement” to keep him in office.

“MAGA loves it,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News this week, defending his foreign policy approach. “MAGA loves what I’m doing. MAGA loves everything I do.”

“MAGA is me,” he added. “MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.”

WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released new statistics on assaults against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement who now face a more than 1,300% increase in assaults, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

Sanctuary politicians have created an environment that encourages rampant assaults on law enforcement.

During the first year of the Trump administration, from January 20 – December 31, 2025, DHS officials reported 275 assaults as compared to the 19 reported assaults during the same period in 2024. This is a horrific 1,347% increase in assaults against ICE officers.

From January 21, 2025 – January 7, 2026, ICE law enforcement officers experienced 66 vehicular attacks against them, compared to only 2 during the same time period the previous year. This is a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks.

“This unprecedented increase in violence against law enforcement is a direct result of sanctuary politicians and the media creating an environment that demonizes our law enforcement and encourages rampant assaults against them. Dangerous criminals – whether they be illegal aliens or U.S. citizens – are assaulting law enforcement and turning their vehicles into weapons to attack law enforcement,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Still, the brave men and women of DHS will not be deterred and will continue arresting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens. Anyone who attacks law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Below are just a few samplings of the violent rhetoric against DHS law enforcement:

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called ICE law enforcement the “modern-day Gestapo.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to “get the f**k out of Minneapolis.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for people to “fight” President Trump’s agenda “in the streets.”

Governor Pritzker claimed the United States is ""essentially"" becoming Nazi Germany as a result of ICE’s heroic efforts.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu compared mask-wearing ICE agents to a Neo-Nazi group.

Rep. Becca Balint likens ICE law enforcement officers to “vigilantes” engaging in “kidnapping.”

This rhetoric is contributing to a more than 1,300% increase in assaults against DHS law enforcement.

A non-exhaustive list of physical assaults include:

A pedophile and criminal illegal alien hammered an ICE officer in the face with a metal coffee cup, breaking his lip open with a laceration requiring 13 stitches.

A group of at least ten violent individuals opened fire on ICE officers at the Prairieland Detention Center.

A criminal illegal alien viciously bit an ICE officer while resisting arrest.

A sniper indiscriminately opened fire on the Dallas ICE facility and shot three detainees, killing two and injuring a third.

A violent crowd attacked Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents who were conducting arrests of rioters who previously threw rocks at federal law enforcement vehicles at a marijuana facility.

A non-exhaustive list of vehicular assaults includes:

A criminal illegal alien and suspected Tren de Aragua gang member, Luis Jesus Acosta Gutierrez,rammed a law enforcement vehicle into a tree during a vehicle stop.

ICE officers were targeted duringtwo separate vehicular assaults in the Chicago metro area during Operation Midway Blitz.

An illegal alien hit an ICE officer with a vehicle, nearly crushing the officer

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s message is clear: you will not stop or slow us down. ICE and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

ST. PAUL, Minnesota. Jan. 8, 2026 – Education Minnesota President Monica Byron released the following statement demanding ICE stay away from Minnesota schools in the wake of yesterday’s ICE actions involving educators and students.

“Yesterday’s actions by ICE in Minnesota—including the shooting of a community member, the unjust detention of a Minnesota educator, and the use of pepper spray on students—are unconscionable in a civil society.

ICE’s continued operations make every Minnesotan less safe. Their presence near our schools puts students and educators at serious risk. Every moment they remain near schools endangers children, educators and families. We demand that ICE operations be kept away from schools so students, educators and staff can learn and work in safety and peace.

Beyond the physical danger, ICE’s actions directly undermine teaching and learning. Yesterday, an elementary school was placed on lockdown, and schools in Minnesota’s largest city were forced to close for two days—two days of learning our students will never get back. Seats are empty in Minnesota classrooms across the state right now as families keep students at home in an attempt to keep them safe from ICE. This disruption comes on top of the ongoing fear and emotional harm students experience when ICE operates in their communities.

As Minnesotans and Americans, we agree that schools must be places of safety, learning and belonging. This is not a partisan issue—it is a moral one. The Trump Administration must act now and order all ICE operations to stay away from schools and out of all school zones across Minnesota.”",https://educationminnesota.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/News-release-graphic.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 21:57:26.292294

""I just wish this administration didn't make such a drastic leap,"" she said. If families can't get child care subsidies. that's going to impact so many people in so many horrible ways that I don't think they're grasping.

The Trump administration's crackdown on the $12 billion Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes care for 1.4 million children from low-income households, has rattled child care providers and families that rely on the aid money. Citing unspecified allegations of fraud, Trump administration officials are requiring states to provide extra documentation before receiving the money.

It's unclear if or when child care providers and families like Rodriguez's would feel the pinch.

Child care centers are bracing for scrutiny and possible cuts

The administration announced last week that state officials will be required to provide additional information to receive the federal child care money. On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it would freeze the funding for child care subsidies until they provided even more exhaustive documentation.

The department said it also would withhold other federal safety net money for those states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York — including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which supports low-income parents with children under 18 with direct payments and by providing them with child care.

The administration has not released information about the fraud allegations that prompted the new scrutiny.

HHS said in a statement that it ""identified concerns that these benefits intended for American citizens and lawful residents may have been improperly provided to individuals who are not eligible under federal law.""

The actions raised fears of payment delays and disruptions for the beleaguered child care industry, which has been struggling under staff shortages, long waits for subsidy programs and the effects of the Trump administration crackdown on immigration.

Ruth Friedman, who headed the federal Office of Child Care under President Joe Biden, said she was concerned the new requirements would lead to delays in funding, which could immediately endanger child care programs. The information the administration asked for might not be readily available, she said.

Providers say they already face extensive regulations

Already, child care providers comply with extensive regulations to receive federal subsides. Dawn Uribe, who runs Mis Amigos Preschool with several Minnesota locations, said staff have to make sure kids sign in and out with the correct ID, and it can take a month to get paid for services. For years, inspectors have regularly visited to assess their records.

""There's already so much oversight that goes into this so I don't really understand how much more they can do,"" Uribe said.

Uribe, like other child care providers, stressed how tightly federal funds are in her state, so much so that she's considering forgoing them altogether, In addition to the administrative burden, child care providers lose money when they enroll children who receive subsidies.

""It's so much work to accept subsidies from the government,"" Uribe said.

Karen DeVos, who runs three childcare facilities in rural northwest Minnesota, is preparing her staff to pull records on the spot in case an investigator shows up unannounced. Daycare centers are regularly subjected to audits and attendance checks, she said.

""If we continue to view every provider as somebody who could be committing fraud, we are going to lose really valuable resources in our child care providers,"" DeVos said. ""There is only so much stress that people can take and not knowing every single day if somebody is going to knock on your door and accuse you of something is terrifying.""

Beyond official investigators, some providers are wary of amateur sleuths showing up at their doors like Nick Shirley, the right-wing influencer who claimed he'd found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. The Trump administration has cited his viral video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams.

Grants provide a lifeline for parents

Even with two incomes, Charity Pallum said she and her husband would not be able to afford child care for their 1-year-old twins. But because of the federal child care subsidies, both Pallum, a teacher, and her husband, who works at a car dealership, are able to work full-time.

If Pallum's family were to lose that support, her husband might have to stop working, putting a pinch on their family budget.

""I guess our plans are, 'We're just going to see how this goes,'"" said Pallum, a teacher living in Ada, Minnesota.

Pallum said neither she nor her husband want to risk missing paychecks if they lose the child care subsidy.

""We have responsibilities to our families and we have responsibilities to our work, and we want to maintain both,"" said Pallum. With federal childcare funds, ""we can give our twins a consistent schedule. They do so much for the twins and they do so much for us, just being consistent and being able to live up to our responsibilities as parents and as community members.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2025-12-31T202800Z_457359853_MT1ZUMA000BPHDFM_RTRMADP_3_ZUMA-1024x682.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 20:57:05.775733

The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement strategy has prioritized political theater over public safety. By abandoning clear enforcement priorities, it has driven up arrests of people with no criminal history and pushed agents chase numbers instead of genuine threats. Under pressure to increase arrests and rapidly hire 12,000 new officers, the administration has tolerated tactics that are unprofessional, dangerous, and deadly—from chokeholds and teargas to wrongful arrests of US citizens and armed confrontations with bystanders. The expanded use of masks has opened the door to impersonations by criminals and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has justified these trends by citing dramatic increases in assaults on ICE officers that are not supported by available evidence. With thousands of hastily hired, minimally trained officers now in the pipeline, these problems are poised to escalate unless significant course corrections are made.

Lack of Priorities

For the first time since 1999, U.S. interior immigration enforcement is operating without explicit enforcement priorities. On his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive order that rescinded the Biden administration’s priorities and instructed ICE, among other agencies, to set their own priorities that “protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people.” This broke with 26 years of continuous, explicit interior immigration enforcement priorities, maintained across Democratic and Republican administrations.

The consequences are already visible. Even though ICE has stopped publishing arrest or deportation statistics, detention data released through the end of November—as required by the FY 2020 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill—shows a marked increase in the number of people detained with no criminal record. As of December 13, 2025, 70% of individuals in immigration detention had never been convicted of a crime. Communities are experiencing enforcement that is broader, less targeted, and less tethered to public safety than at any point in recent memory.

Masking and Problematic Policing Tactics

There has been a significant rise in high-profile arrests of noncitizens and citizens alike in which ICE and other federal law enforcement officers are using masking and other concerning policing tactics. Videos have caught ICE and other federal officers pulling US citizens from their vehicles, pointing guns at crowds or specific bystanders, impersonating utility workers, and using excessive force, such as chokeholds, kneeling on a target’s head, vehicle maneuvers, pepper balls against peaceful protesters and reporters, and tear gas at close range and in residential areas. The enforcement push has included at least fourteen shootings so far, two of which were fatal. One was the shooting of a 37-year old US citizen in Minneapolis, who appeared to be driving away from the scene, but who the administration quickly labeled as having tried to commit “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Despite the widespread evidence of problematic policing tactics and violations of DHS’s own use of force policies, DHS has given no indication that any officers have been disciplined. Instead, in response to a report on potential violations of DHS’s use of force policy, DHS issued a statement praising the officers’ “incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated.”

Early on in the administration, local police began speaking out against ICE tactics and the ways they are eroding trust with law enforcement. Recently, when discussing ICE’s tactics, Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, explained that police departments in some cities are getting 911 calls from community residents reporting the presence of armed masked men in their neighborhoods.

Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection and police chief in Seattle, has also spoken out against the tactics, saying “These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job… I couldn’t be more disappointed.” Kerlikowske also explained that federal immigration officers “do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment.”

Arrests of US Citizens

News and social media sites are flooded with stories of US citizens being arrested and detained by ICE, the vast majority of which are later released without charge. Here are some of the more appalling examples:

In Alabama, US. citizen Leonardo Garcia Venegas has been arrested twice by federal agents. During both arrests, which occurred one month apart, agents dismissed his Real ID as being fake. During one of the arrests, agents refused to remove his handcuffs until hours later when Venegas provided his social security number.

In California, George Retes, a 25-year-old veteran and US citizen, was attempting to enter his workplace in Ventura County, CA, when he was stopped and detained by immigration agents. Agents used tear gas to try and disperse protesters, which filled up his car, leaving him choking. Agents then refused to verify his identification, smashed his window, pepper sprayed Retes, knelt on him, and left him zip tied for four hours until being transferred to a cell. He was held for three days, was not allowed to make a phone call or contact a lawyer, and missed his daughter’s third birthday.

In Florida, Silvia was detained with her undocumented husband while they were on their way to work, despite attempts to prove her citizenship. Her family claims that federal agents didn’t believe her since she didn’t sound Puerto Rican to them. Silvia, who was pregnant at the time, was thrown to the ground and handcuffed, remaining detained for 5 hours. Silvia says the incident led to her later losing her unborn child.

In Oklahoma, a US citizen mother and her three US citizen daughters were woken in the middle of the night, forced to stand in the rain in their underwear, and had their phones, laptops, and all of their cash savings confiscated. The federal agents were executing a search warrant for the family’s home, but none of the individuals listed on the warrant lived in the home. The agents also failed to listen to the family’s pleas that they were US citizens.

The US government does not keep track of the numbers of US citizens arrested in the course of immigration enforcement operations. In October, ProPublica compiled and reviewed publicly available incidents and found more than 170 US citizen arrests that occurred during the first nine months of President Trump’s second administration. Third Way is also collecting cases of US citizens arrested by federal immigration agents and would be happy to share this resource.

Imitation of ICE Officers

Federal agents’ use of masks and failure to identify themselves have created an opening for bad actors to impersonate ICE officers. Examples include:

In Delaware, two men wearing vests labeled “ICE” pulled a man over, removed him from his vehicle, and took his wallet, while wielding a knife and a firearm.

In Colorado, a masked man walked into a grocery store with a semi-automatic gun in a holster on his hip. When an employee told him that firearms were not allowed in the business, he flashed a fake ICE badge.

In Florida, a woman wearing an ICE shirt and a mask kidnapped a hotel clerk, who was later able to escape.

In Pennsylvania, a man wearing a mask and impersonating ICE, entered an auto repair shop, yelled “Immigration!” tied up a woman who remained in the store, and stole $1,000 in cash before fleeing.

In New York, a man ordered a woman into a basement stairwell after telling her he was an ICE agent. He assaulted and robbed her.

Also in New York, three men in black vests entered a restaurant claiming to be ICE agents. Inside, they tied up two workers, kicking one to the ground and pulling a garbage bag over the others’ head.

In North Carolina, a man allegedly posed as ICE, showing a badge, and threatening to deport a woman if she didn’t have sex with him at a motel.

In South Carolina, a man presented himself as an ICE agent to pull over and detain a group of Latino men.

While there is no official count of alleged ICE officer impersonations, a CNN review found two dozen incidents of such in 2025, a significant rise from prior years. The problem has become so persistent that in October, the FBI issued a law enforcement bulletin warning of criminals posing as US immigration officers who have carried out robberies, kidnappings, and sexual assaults.

Safety of ICE Officers

The Trump administration has defended its masking policy by claiming attacks on ICE officers are up “more than 1,000 percent” and death threats by “8,000%.” Yet DHS has provided no data to substantiate those numbers.

While there is no doubt assaults on ICE officers have increased, and attacks on law enforcement should be taken seriously, there is no public evidence backing the administration’s claim that they have spiked dramatically. An NPR analysis of court records found a 25% rise in charges for assault against federal officers compared to the same period in the prior year—a far cry from a “more than 1,000 percent” increase. For the administration’s claims to be true, there would have to be thousands of assaults that did not result in criminal charges.

One of the best ways to improve both officer and community safety is de-escalation. However, despite ICE training on de-escalation and its role in DHS’s use of force policy, it is not being consistently used. The many videos featuring aggressive tactics and unnecessary escalations suggest the problem is systemic.

Talking Points

A US citizen is dead following an ICE operation. When civil immigration enforcement results in lethal force against an American, it raises profound questions about training, escalation, and command responsibility that Congress has an obligation to answer.

The Trump administration’s initial response utterly failed to meet the gravity of the moment. Instead of calling for a thorough investigation and preserving public trust, senior officials rushed to rhetoric and narrative-setting. That instinct—to defend first and investigate later—undermines accountability and public safety.

Interior enforcement works best when it is focused on genuine threats—not political theater. By abandoning clear enforcement priorities for the first time in 26 years, this administration has pushed ICE officers to chase numbers instead of public safety.

The data we do have shows enforcement drifting away from its mission of keeping Americans safe. Detention records reveal a sharp increase in people being swept up despite having no criminal history—a sign of an unfocused system and a waste of limited resources.

No one should tolerate unprofessional or dangerous policing tactics in immigration enforcement. We’ve now seen chokeholds, tear gas, masked arrests, and armed confrontations with bystanders—tactics that have no place in routine civil enforcement.

Republican lawmakers are abdicating their duties to their own constituents. More than 170 US citizens have been detained by ICE this year alone—people pulled from cars, zip-tied for hours, left in the rain in their underwear, and in some cases hospitalized. This is a systemic failure that needs Congressional oversight.

The widespread use of masks has created serious public-safety risks. Criminals are impersonating ICE officers to carry out robberies, kidnappings, and assaults—so frequently that the FBI issued a national bulletin. Police officers and the public both pay the price for ICE masking.

Local law-enforcement are raising alarms. Police chiefs across the country are coming out of the woodwork to say ICE’s tactics are undermining trust and generating 911 calls about “armed masked men”—showing just how far routine enforcement has drifted from community-policing standards.

Every assault on an ICE officer is unacceptable—and we take those threats seriously. But the administration’s claims of a 1,000% increase in assaults is not backed by evidence. The best way to protect officers and communities alike is through proven de-escalation tactics that reduce risk, not escalate it.

The administration’s rush to hire and deploy 12,000 new officers is a recipe for more mistakes. Flooding the field with minimally trained agents increases risks for the public, other federal officers, and the agents themselves.

Public safety demands a reset: clear priorities, accountable practices, and professional standards. When enforcement is targeted, transparent, and grounded in best practices, it protects communities and preserves trust in the immigration system.

Democrats support strong, smart, and lawful enforcement. That means focusing resources on individuals who pose threats, not sweeping up people at random; enforcing the law with professionalism; and ensuring federal officers have the training they need to keep everyone safe.

Dems Discussing Interior Immigration Enforcement

Voters have continuously questioned Democrats’ handling of immigration and border security issues and continue to place more trust in Republican tactics despite disagreeing with the current approach by the Trump administration. To gain this trust, Democrats need to be vocal about their stances on immigration, especially as this issue continues to be at the forefront of concerns for voters. Here are some examples of Democrats speaking well on the administration’s current approach to interior immigration enforcement:

Representative Greg Stanton calls attention to how the administration raced to hire and deploy thousands of federal agents without proper training, leading to the death of a woman killed by ICE.

Representative Nikki Budzinski responds to the death of a woman shot by ICE, calling for a full investigation and accountability from the administration.

Senator Alex Padilla speaks on several instances of US citizens being detained by federal immigration officers.

Representative Gabe Vasquez, in an op-ed piece, writes that immigration enforcement operations hinder local law enforcement, reduces public safety, and calls for smart investments that keeps the border secure, holds criminals accountable, and creates legal pathways to citizenship.

Senators Mark Warner and Ed Markey discuss the constitutional concerns that Americans face with Border Patrol’s use of license plate surveillance technologies.

Senator Elissa Slotkin, in an interview with the New York Times, speaks on Democrats being scared of offending immigrant advocacy groups or people further on the left, doubling down that Democrats need be more comfortable with clamping down on the rules when it comes to legal immigration.

Representatives Tom Suozzi and Brian Fitzpatrick discuss where the administration has been right such as securing the border, deporting violent criminals, and targeting narcoterrorism while simultaneously reinforcing how it shouldn’t go after hard working individuals with families and how most of these tactics don’t truly address the current immigration system.

Representative Tom Suozzi advocates for lawmakers to lean in on legalizing individuals who have been here for decades and haven’t committed a crime.","https://uploads.thirdway.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=baseline-jpeg,quality=90,width=1200,height=630,fit=cover,gravity=auto/https://uploads.thirdway.org/products/HG_shutterstock_2683835855%401.5x.jpg",N,,2026-01-09 01:57:06.260747

The Minneapolis shooting occurred Wednesday morning on a residential street.","The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by a federal immigration agent during an operation Wednesday in Minneapolis sparked public outrage and protests across the country, including in California, where agents have been involved in several shootings.

California lawmakers and immigrant rights groups condemned the killing of the woman, who was identified by family as Renee Nicole Good, a wife and mother of three.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom took to social media to say President Trump had a role in the violence.

“His deliberate escalation of intimidation and chaos has consequences,” Newsom wrote. “His reckless crackdown must end.”

In a written statement, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withdraw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from Los Angeles County and other areas of the United States.

“These ICE agents are undertrained and trigger-happy and everyone who has seen this video knows ICE murdered this woman,” Hahn said. “These ICE agents are too dangerous and they should not be operating on our streets.”

In a strongly worded statement, Assemblymember Mark González (D-Los Angeles) called the shooting a “public execution.”

“ICE does not give a single s— who you are, how long you’ve lived here, or how hard you’ve worked. They are coming for ALL of us. They are armed with fear, force, and zero accountability,” he wrote. “I unequivocally condemn the actions of federal agents in Minneapolis. The fatal shooting of Renee was a public execution, NOT self-defense.”

Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center, said it was not the first time immigration enforcement operations “resulted in violence and bloodshed.” He said federal immigration agents have fired on at least nine people in five states and Washington, D.C.

On New Year’s Eve, Keith Porter Jr. was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE agent outside his apartment complex in Northridge. Family members and their attorney said Porter was firing a gun into the air to celebrate and posed no threat.

“The tragic killings of people by ICE agents are yet another example of how mass immigration raids endanger our communities and erode our constitutional rights,” Fouladi said.

Porter’s death is just one of several shootings and use-of-force incidents involving ICE agents in Southern California.

In October immigration agents shot and wounded Carlos Jimenez, a U.S. citizen, in Ontario, just days after TikTok streamer Carlitos Ricardo Parias was shot in the arm. And in August a federal agent in San Bernardino opened fire on people inside a truck. The driver sped off after an agent smashed the driver’s side window.

The Minneapolis shooting occurred Wednesday morning on a residential street. Videos taken by witnesses and shared on social media show the driver of a maroon compact sport utility vehicle reversing before accelerating forward and turning to leave when an agent — standing in front of the vehicle — opens fire.

Noem said during a news conference that the woman “weaponized her vehicle” and that it was an “act of terrorism.” She defended the actions of the agent, who she claimed had been dragged by a vehicle in June, and reported that the agent was hospitalized and released.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey disputed Noem’s description of events leading up to the shooting.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bull—,” he said. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”

President Trump took to social media to say the situation was being “studied” and also defended the actions of the agent.

“They are just trying to do the job of making America safe,” he wrote in part. “We need to stand by and protect our law enforcement officers.”

Hours after the slaying, thousands descended at the site of the shooting to hold a vigil for the woman while hundreds of demonstrators banged on the glass windows of a federal courthouse building in downtown Minneapolis, chanting, “ICE out now!”

In downtown Los Angeles, dozens gathered at Placita Olvera to call for an end to immigration raids that have brought terror to American communities, and Thursday morning the nonprofit Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice held a demonstration outside of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services building.

Videos shared on social media show people chanting “ICE out of L.A.” while holding signs, including some that read: “From Minneapolis to Los Angeles, stop ICE terror.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1acc8e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7012x3681+0+498/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F02%2F9f8a0a9047b29e9f156ed01a1bd8%2F1536595-me-ice-agent-shooting-northridge-jja-0028.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 22:57:15.210018

Police have secured both scenes for an investigation. East Burnside is closed westbound between Northeast 145th Avenue and 148th Avenue.

""We are still in the early stages of this incident,"" said Chief Bob Day. ""We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.""

Staff at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center confirmed to KGW that the hospital was on lockdown shortly before 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. OHSU said it was not on lockdown.

At Adventist Health Portland, located on Southeast Main Street by I-205, a KGW crew saw an area outside the hospital surrounded with yellow police tape, with Portland police officers and ICE agents on-scene. Staff confirmed that there had been an incident in one of the parking lots.

In the middle of the roped-off parking lot, KGW saw a damaged vehicle with its doors open.

In a tweet, FBI Portland said it was the lead agency investigating an ""agent involved shooting"" involving ""Customs and Border Patrol"" officers — referring either to Border Patrol or the overarching agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection — and that two people were wounded. They later deleted the tweet.

FBI agents could be seen Thursday afternoon at the scene on East Burnside, where Portland police found the two injured people.

'Show up with calm and purpose'

The incident Thursday happened to coincide with a protest against ICE happening downtown. Demonstrators planned to go up to Mayor Keith Wilson's office at city hall to demand he revoke the permit for the ICE facility in Portland, spurred on by the agency's recent deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis.

But outside Wilson's office, a constituent consultant told the small group of demonstrators that there'd been an incident in the city involving ICE, and that the mayor was in an emergency meeting.

Almost simultaneously, around 2:40 p.m., Portland City Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney abruptly broke into an ongoing debate over the election of a new council president, saying that the council needed to immediately go on recess.

Just before 4 p.m., Pirtle-Guiney returned and adjourned the meeting for the day, after looking to reschedule for Wednesday, Jan. 14.

Minutes later, Mayor Keith Wilson put out a statement, saying in part:

""We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts. Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences. As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.

""Federal militarization undermines effective, community‑based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region. I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents' civil and human rights.

""I call on every Portlander to represent our values and to show up with calm and purpose during this difficult time. Portland does not respond to violence with violence. We respond with clarity, unity, and a commitment to justice. We must stand together to protect Portland.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/ea6b9d5e-d607-4d13-bd01-0e0f4c6ba6d5/20260108T233607/ea6b9d5e-d607-4d13-bd01-0e0f4c6ba6d5_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 19:57:34.014708

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department.
The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP.
But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.
Under President Donald Trump, many federal agencies have been drafted to work on immigration enforcement.","More than a half dozen years after Washington began limiting access to driver’s license data for immigration enforcement, federal officials were still using the information for immigration arrests as recently as late last year, a report released Thursday shows.

And despite the state implementing new restrictions twice last year, some immigration authorities still have access to driver’s license data, according to state officials and the report by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action,” according to a 10-page joint statement by his office, State Patrol and Washington’s Department of Licensing. But the statement said the governor “will do so with reason and care.”

“Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety,” the statement continued.

The UW center report documented nine cases of immigration arrests between August and November last year that followed queries by federal agents to Nlets, a national computer system that allows law enforcement agencies to access state driver’s license data, criminal history and other information stored throughout the country. Such queries, in Washington, go through a State Patrol platform called ACCESS, which acts as a “switch” to send information back to Nlets and the requesting parties, according to the UW report and state officials.

The Seattle Times, separately, obtained information about another case — the widely publicized arrest of Kirkland high school theater manager Fernando Rocha — indicating federal agents queried Nlets for state licensing information six times before his arrest last July.

Officials can enter a driver’s license number into Nlets and retrieve the registered owner’s information, including their home address, date of birth, height and hair color. They can also get a photo. Officials can then check that information against Department of Homeland Security data for alleged immigration violations and use the data to verify or identify targets for arrest, according to the UW report.

In several cases tracked by the UW center through public disclosure documents and ICE records, federal agents looked up information on a truck or van, then followed the vehicle and made a traffic stop leading to an arrest.

Federal agents queried Nlets about one man’s license plate after he left a Latino grocery story, saying in reports they were “performing systems checks on vehicles moving near the location of a targeted subject,” according to the report. They determined he lacked authorization to be in the U.S. and arrested him. The man later told UW researchers he had been pistol-whipped, tased and pepper-sprayed in his eyes as he was arrested.

Such arrests, aided by state licensing information, have turned roads into immigration enforcement “hunting grounds,” the UW report says.

Washington’s attempt to limit driver’s license information sharing started in 2018, after The Seattle Times revealed that the Department of Licensing was routinely giving out data to immigration agents directly by email. Then Gov. Jay Inslee halted the practice.

But immigration agents remained able to access data through computerized systems, including one controlled by the licensing department. A King 5 investigation led the state in August to revoke U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to that system. That still left Nlets as a point of access.

Advertising

Dozens of Democratic elected officials, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, sounded an alarm about immigration enforcement implications of Nlets late last year. Washington officials, in their joint statement, said the state cut off ICE’s access to Nlets on Nov. 19.

But Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, director of the UW center, said she was told in writing last month by a State Patrol spokesperson that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division, which investigates criminal activity such as drugs and weapons smuggling, continued to have access to Nlets.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has access to the system and conducted eight of the nine queries documented by Godoy’s center. Seven of the nine cases involved civil immigration violations rather than criminal activity, according to the report.

The state is now reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, according to the officials’ joint statement, which also presented reasons why the agency’s continued access might be important. CBP might, for instance, use Nlets “to find out that the man about to board a plane with a small child is wanted for human trafficking,” the statement said

It added that queries do not reveal the purpose data is sought and therefore objected to suggestions in the UW report that state officials are actively participating in civil immigration enforcement. The statement called parts of a draft report reviewed by state officials “misleading” and “incendiary.”

At a news conference Thursday, Godoy and other immigrant advocates nevertheless presented the state’s role in sharing driver’s license information as a betrayal of public trust and a violation of a 2019 state law that limits most forms of state cooperation with immigration enforcement.

“Washington has long said it is a welcoming state,” said Burien City Councilmember Hugo Garcia, who, like others, pointed out that the state was the first in the country to allow all residents driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status. But faith in the state collapses, he said, “when state systems are used directly or indirectly to aid immigration enforcement.”

Noting he is an immigrant himself and speaking initially in Spanish at the news conference, held the day after an ICE official fatally shot a woman in Minnesota and the same day two people were allegedly shot by federal immigration agents in Portland, Garcia said many immigrants are feeling “fear that something as ordinary as driving to work, taking your kids to schools or picking up groceries, could lead to detention or separation from your family.”

He said he met with one Burien man detailed by immigration enforcement agents while taking his kid to school. The child walked home alone afterwards.

Advocates called for a comprehensive way to end information sharing with immigration officials, rather than partial measures, though how to do so isn’t totally clear.

The UW center’s report looked to New York, which it said has cut off Nlets access to both ICE and CBP. (Washington officials’ statement said New York has only partially stopped CBP access.) But in the news conference, some acknowledged that other federal agencies could also access Nlets and share information with immigration agents.

Under President Donald Trump, many federal agencies have been drafted to work on immigration enforcement. Information about Rocha, the Kirkland theater manager, obtained through public disclosure appears to show the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted one Nlets search, along with others conducted by ICE and CBP.

The UW report also suggested a technical configuration that would limit Nlets searches in Washington to data from enhanced driver’s licenses, which are held only by U.S. citizens.

In their joint statement, Washington officials cited historic challenges to limiting Nlets access, including lawsuits and threats to federal funding. Officials did not respond to an email asking whether those challenges still exist.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01082026_tzr_tzr_135059.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-08 19:57:38.175171

On Thursday, Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) explained that federal authorities from the FBI and the US Department of Justice had denied the state bureau access to case materials.

Previously, state and federal officials had been slated to work together on the investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Macklin Good, 37, a mother of three who was shot dead in her car on Wednesday.

“The investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said on Thursday.

“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands.”

Good’s death has become a political flashpoint in the US, with observers denouncing ICE’s actions as excessive and the administration of President Donald Trump defending the shooting as an act of self-defence.

The decision to exclude state authorities from participating in the investigation has further exacerbated tensions, as Minnesota officials accuse the Trump administration of playing politics with the case.

“Minnesota must be part of this investigation,” Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, told reporters at a Thursday news conference.

He pointed out that the BCA has staff dedicated to investigating use-of-force incidents by law enforcement officers.

“These are nonpartisan, career professionals that have spent years building the trust of the community,” Walz said.

He added that the high-profile nature of the shooting – and the misrepresentations he has seen from the Trump administration – leads him to fear for the outcome of the investigation.

“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said. “And I say that because people in positions of power have already passed judgement, from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem.”

Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has publicly accused Good of “domestic terrorism” since her death, though there is no definitive evidence to support that claim.

Still, state officials, including Minnesota’s Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison, have signalled they may continue to pursue charges in the case.

“If federal authorities are saying they won’t even entertain a joint and inclusive investigation, that is deeply disturbing,” Ellison told CNN.

He added that state authorities could still launch their own independent probe, with or without the cooperation of the federal government. “The federal government can’t stop Minnesota from doing its own, but I would hope that it wouldn’t come to that.”

Shooting sparks nationwide outrage

Good’s shooting on Wednesday has drawn renewed scrutiny to the Trump administration’s decision to surge immigration officers to communities across the US – and the clashes that have resulted between protesters and agents.

Since taking office for a second term, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy that includes a campaign of mass deportation.

Trump has concentrated many of his immigration enforcement actions on Democrat-led jurisdictions, including Minneapolis, where he has blamed the large Somali American community for a fraud scandal that has roiled the state.

After a series of racist remarks against Somali Americans in December – including calling them “garbage” – his administration announced an uptick in enforcement actions in Minnesota.

Democratic officials have accused the Trump administration of needlessly ratcheting up tensions with its crackdowns.

State and federal officials have offered starkly different accounts of Wednesday’s shooting, in which an unidentified ICE agent shot Good, a US citizen, in a residential neighbourhood.

The ‍ICE agent who shot Good was ⁠among 2,000 federal officers deployed to the Minneapolis area in what the Department of Homeland Security described as the “largest DHS operation ever”.

DHS officials, including Noem, have accused Good of intentionally trying to ram agents.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, called that assertion “bulls***” and “garbage”, pointing to bystander videos that appeared to contradict the government’s account.

Videos appeared to show masked officers approaching Good’s car, which was stopped on a Minneapolis street. Good appeared to be waving for other vehicles to pass her.

As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed and then began driving forward, turning to the right in an apparent attempt to leave the scene.

Another officer, who had been filming the scene before walking to the front of Good’s car, drew his gun after the car’s bumper appeared to have passed by his body. He is believed to have fired three times, penetrating the driver’s windows.

Videos circulated online did not appear to show contact between the car and the agents, and the officer stayed on his feet, though Noem said he was taken to a hospital and released.

Trump falsely claimed on social media that the woman “ran over the ICE Officer”.

In a statement to local media, Good’s mother identified her as the shooting victim. According to The Washington Post, Good leaves behind her 15-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 12 and six.

Uproar spreads across country

In the wake of Good’s killing, protesters took to the streets in Minneapolis to condemn the ICE agent’s actions and the wider ICE presence in the city, which has been met with frequent demonstrations.

On Thursday morning, about 1,000 demonstrators gathered at a federal building where an immigration court is housed, chanting “shame” and “murder” at armed and masked federal officers.

At least one protester was detained as federal officers armed with PepperBall guns and tear gas confronted the crowd of demonstrators, according to the AFP news agency.

Governor Walz called for Friday to be a “day of unity” in memory of Good’s death. “While we cannot bring back Renee Nicole Good, we can honour her life by standing together for decency, democracy, compassion and our shared values,” he said.

Protests have taken place and are planned in New York City, Seattle, Detroit, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Antonio, New Orleans and Chicago in reaction to the shooting.

Demonstrations are also scheduled in smaller cities in Arizona, North Carolina and New Hampshire later this week.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695ff7922bac-1767896978.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-08 21:57:40.038936

Video and eyewitness accounts, which show the woman attempting to flee from ICE as they aggressively attempted to enter her vehicle, contradict the Trump administration’s claims that agents acted in self-defense. The killing has intensified outrage and grief across Minnesota and the nation, as calls grow for accountability and an end to ICE crackdowns that are driving fear and putting communities in danger.

Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, President and CEO of Interfaith Alliance, released the following statement:

“This shocking killing is another tragic example of ICE’s brutality, and the deadly consequences of the Trump administration’s reckless and authoritarian immigration crackdown. Our hearts are with the victim’s loved ones and the Minneapolis community, as they grieve and respond to this horrific tragedy.

Wednesday’s shooting is the latest example of what happens when an administration makes dehumanization, aggression, and cruelty the foundation of its agenda. The American people don’t want blood on the streets or armed government forces surrounding our homes, schools, and places of worship.

Religious leaders and communities now face a fundamental choice: to choose love, not ICE. Across faith traditions, we are called to protect human dignity, care for the vulnerable, and resist systems that thrive on fear. When the Department of Homeland Security attempts to cloak ICE brutality in divine language, it draws directly from Christian nationalist ideology — one that teaches some human lives matter more than others. It’s an attempt to prime the public to accept violence against those deemed outsiders. People of faith must reject this distortion of religion and refuse to let our faiths be weaponized to serve the authoritarian whims of President Trump.

‍The way forward demands both moral clarity and courageous action. Faith communities must speak out, stand in solidarity with immigrant families, and insist on accountability for this killing and other acts of violent repression. We will continue to take to the streets in peaceful and principled resistance to authoritarian abuse. Choosing love over ICE is not just a slogan — it is a moral stance rooted in the belief that safety comes from solidarity, not terror, and that our shared future depends on dignity, compassion, and justice for all.”

Walz on Thursday told the federal government to ""leave Minnesota alone"" and allow state officials to conduct the investigation into the shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent that left one woman dead and Minneapolis residents on edge.

Walz repeatedly expressed concerns about the federal government leading the investigation without Minnesota officials.

""It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome, and I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president, to the vice president, to [Secretary of Homeland Security] Kristi Noem,"" Walz said.

Officials within the Trump administration quickly defended the ICE agent's actions as justifiable use of force, after civilian footage taken at the scene seemed to show Renee Good's SUV attempting to drive away from masked ICE agents, one of whom subsequently fired three shots into the driver's window, killing the 37-year-old wife and mother.

During Thursday's White House press conference, Vice President Vance said, ""I don't care what Tim Walz says"" and added that the ICE agent's life was in danger during the incident.

""You have a woman who was trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement operation. … You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator,"" Vance said.

At the core of each press conference was a different understanding of the facts.

Walz called the federal law enforcement presence in Minnesota ""a reckless ICE mobilization"" that ""is not keeping us safe"" and encouraged Minnesotans to support Good's family.

At the White House, Vance said, ""This is absolutely a tragedy, but it's a tragedy of the making of the far left. They have radicalized a very small segment of the population, taught them that ICE agents are engaging in wide-scale violation of people's rights.""

To get a better understanding of what happened, both men said an investigation would be necessary.

Walz said that Minnesota has the experience required to handle high-profile investigations such as this, pointing to the 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of former police officer Derek Chauvin.

""The only way we find the answers is a thorough investigation by nonpartisan professionals,"" Walz said. ""We've delivered that. We've been able to do it.""

The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was initially tapped to conduct a joint investigation with the FBI, released a statement on Thursday stating that the agency had been kicked off the search in favor of allowing the federal government to conduct the operation on its own.

Vance said the federal government is better suited to handle the investigation. ""The Department of Justice is already investigating this. The Department of Homeland Security is already investigating this,"" Vance said.

He added, ""But the simple fact is, what you see is what you get in this case.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3500x1969+0+182/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F8b%2Fe53358af46bb9438ad85e9a71e60%2Fap26008601965012.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:59:23.604574

Memories of the chaos that followed the killing of George Floyd

Amid that mounting tension, the Trump administration announced Tuesday that it was sending more than 2,000 federal officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in what it claimed would be the biggest immigration enforcement operation in history.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Renee Good during a protest Wednesday against the immigration raids opened fire just blocks from where, in 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd. The parallels were painful and frightening for many in the area, including Stephanie Abel, a 56-year-old Minneapolis nurse, who is keeping her gas tank full and cash handy in memory of the chaos that followed that slaying.

""I thought the federal government would realize that now is not the time to be toying with people,"" Abel said. ""What are they going to try to do to get Minneapolis to ignite?""

Floyd's death sparked the biggest protests of Trump's first term. The president, who is still publicly bitter about the unrest, contends it should have been met with a stronger show of force.

That's the approach Trump has adopted in his second term, trying to cow blue states by surging military and immigration agents into their cities and insisting that anyone who doesn't comply with federal demands will face severe consequences.

Immigration operations that started last summer in liberal strongholds such as Chicago,Los Angeles and Portland also generated large protests. Good is at least the fifth person killed during ICE enforcement efforts.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance said Good's death was ""a tragedy of her own making,"" blamed ""leftist ideology"" and said the media had encouraged protests against Trump's immigration crackdown.

Federal investigators have Somalis in their sights

Watch the segment in the player above.

The Twin Cities operation is intertwined with a conservative effort to make Minnesota the poster child for government fraud. Though prosecutions for the fraudulent use of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal COVID-19 and health aid by social service groups began in the Biden administration, Trump and conservatives have seized on the scandal in recent weeks.

In November, Trump called Minnesota ""a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" after a report by a conservative news site, City Journal, claimed federal money was fraudulently flowing to the militant group al-Shabab. There has been little, if any, evidence, proving such a link. Nevertheless, the president said he would end Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota.

The allegations got a new charge late last month when conservative influencer Nick Shirley posted an unconfirmed video claiming that day care centers in Minneapolis run by Somalis had fraudulently collected over $100 million in government aid.

Jamal Osman, a Somali immigrant and Minneapolis city councilman who lives just a few blocks from the location of the ICE shooting, said he and other prominent Somalis in the area have been swamped with angry calls and messages since Trump made his statements. The vitriol, he said, mainly comes from out of state.

""We have whole groups of people who've never been to Minnesota,"" Osman said in an interview. ""Minnesota is probably one of the nicest places to live. It's a beautiful area with very nice people and we blended in, it's all very nice. We don't really see bad things happening here normally.""

The Trump administration on Tuesday said is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children, including day care funding, in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud. Joining Minnesota on the list were California, Colorado, Illinois and New York.

'Leave our state alone'

Watch the video in the player above.

Minnesota's place on a list of targeted blue states is not unexpected.

Under Walz, Minnesota has become something of a beacon for liberals as an example of a state that expanded the public safety net even as the nation swung to the right. Since Trump's first election, the state has seen large increases in education spending, free school breakfasts and lunches, and improved protection of abortion rights.

Trump lost Minnesota by only 4 percentage points in 2024, making it significantly less liberal than California and New York. Still, it has been reliably Democratic throughout the Trump years, a rarity in the swingy upper Midwest.

The state's political tilt reflects the size of the Twin Cities metro area and its robust population of college-educated liberals, which overwhelm the state's more conservative rural reaches.

It's the sort of cleavage that has defined national politics during Trump's years in office.

""Minnesota is a microcosm of a lot of the tensions we have in our society,"" said David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul. ""We're a country that's hugely polarized, Democrats-Republicans, urban-rural.""

On Thursday, Minnesota was an ominous indicator of the damage those divisions can inflict. Minneapolis schools remained closed after immigration agents clashed with high school students at one campus on Wednesday. The state's National Guard remained on standby at Walz's directive.

Walz begged Trump to ease up, saying Minnesota's residents are ""exhausted"" by the president's ""relentless assault on Minnesota.""

""So please, just give us a break,"" Walz said during a news conference Thursday. ""And if it's me, you're already getting what you want, but leave my people alone. Leave our state alone.""

“And I expect that to continue to happen, as we are seeing in Minneapolis right now.” jmeisner@chicagotribune.com","A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday cited the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent in Minneapolis in declining to immediately dismiss a lawsuit that led to her landmark injunction limiting the use of force by immigration agents during Operation Midway Blitz.

In pressing the pause button, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis told the parties in court she still had concerns over her obligation to protect the class of journalists, clergy and other protesters certified in the lawsuit, noting “if I dismiss this case the preliminary injunction ceases to exist.”

“And it doesn’t give me much comfort in reading news reports that someone … who was described as a legal observer was shot yesterday in Minneapolis,” Ellis told the parties in an afternoon hearing. “So that is my concern.”

Ellis said that “given recent events,” she wants to do a little more digging on the law before making a final decision. She set the next hearing for Jan. 22.

After the hearing, lawyers for the plaintiffs said they had no concerns about the judge’s move, and said they were prepared to bring new litigation should there be a future surge in immigration enforcement here that violates the civil rights of citizens to observe and protest.

“We stand ready to do whatever is necessary to stop President Trump, to stop (Department of Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, to stop (Border Patrol chief Gregory) Bovino, and their agents from violating the most sacred rights of the people of Chicago,” said Craig Futterman, an attorney for the Mandel Legal Aid Clinic.

Futterman also spoke emotionally about Wednesday’s fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a mother who had been out recording immigration operations in Minneapolis when she was shot by an officer while seemingly trying to pull away in her vehicle.

He said the Trump administration’s claims that Good tried to run over the officer before he opened fire have been easily debunked only because “ordinary citizens had the courage to videotape what happened.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday.

The case brought by the Chicago Headline Club and other media groups led to a sweeping preliminary injunction by Ellis in November limiting the use of tear gas and other chemical munitions against the media and protesters and also requiring agents to wear body cameras and clear identification.

The plaintiffs moved to drop the suit last month, however, following ominous signs from the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which called Ellis’ order overbroad and a potential infringement on the separation of powers.

In the request, the plaintiffs claimed victory, saying Bovino and his surge of agents left town soon after Ellis’ injunction was entered on Nov. 8 and that there had been no reports of any unconstitutional behavior by agents in nearly a month.

But an attorney for the Trump administration said in a hearing Dec. 4 that, contrary to media reports, Operation Midway Blitz has not ended and that the administration of President Donald Trump continues to carry out “lawful” immigration enforcement — though she declined to say when or if another surge in Border Patrol agents would hit the city.

Department of Justice attorney Elizabeth Hedges also claimed the dismissal of the lawsuit would bar journalists and protesters from bringing similar claims of constitutional violations in the future — an argument that was immediately called out by Ellis and plaintiffs’ attorneys as a misstatement of the law.

“While it was the government’s position that no agent did anything illegal or unconstitutional, having watched the videos, and having read the reports, and having listened to the witnesses, I strongly disagree,” Ellis said.

Because the lawsuit involved a certified class of plaintiffs, Ellis set a deadline of Thursday for any class members to object to it. None has come forward, the plaintiffs’ attorneys told the judge in court.

Meanwhile, lawyers for the Tribune and other media outlets on Thursday won the release of reams of other evidence that was submitted to the judge for consideration in the case, including use-of-force reports and more footage of incidents around the city.

Department of Justice attorney Andrew Warden, who had objected to the release, said the batch of body-cam videos, which includes footage from up until the judge’s written injunction ruling on Nov. 21, is four times larger than what had previously been released and totals at least 400 hours.

Ellis granted the government time to review the footage and make necessary redactions before it is made public on a “rolling basis” over the next four months.

The judge also agreed to unseal a transcript of testimony given in October by Department of Justice attorney Sean Skedzielewski, which was done in a closed courtroom after the government claimed there were national security concerns.

If Ellis ultimately agrees to dismiss the suit, it will end a case that came to symbolize the havoc Midway Blitz caused in Chicago and shed light on how the operation was carried out, through sworn depositions by Bovino and other leaders as well as the release of body-camera footage showing agents deploying tear gas, pointing guns from passing cars and tackling civilians on the street.

Ellis had tentatively set a hearing on permanent injunction for March.

The 7th Circuit later granted an emergency stay of Ellis’ injunctive relief pending appeal, a process that will also be shelved once the dismissal is approved.

Since then, Bovino and a contingent of Border Patrol agents have already returned once to Chicago, in the form of a seemingly made-for-television jaunt shortly before Christmas. Agents made several arrests in supermarket parking lots and tamale stands while goading angry residents who confronted them and threatening to unleash tear gas.

As recently as Dec. 30, Bovino posted on social media: “If you think we’re done with Chicago, you’d better check yourself before you wreck yourself.”

On Wednesday, meanwhile, Bovino was spotted in Minneapolis where more than 2,000 immigration agents were carrying out an enforcement action there that immediately exploded in controversy with the shooting of Good, 37, a mother of three who’d recently moved to Minnesota.

The New York Times reported Thursday that the Department of Homeland Security had temporarily abandoned a planned immigration enforcement surge in Chicago and ordered agents to report to Minneapolis for support as protests mounted.

Speaking to reporters after Thursday’s hearing, plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said the decision to dismiss the Chicago Headline Club suit made strategic sense, given both the 7th Circuit’s stay and the fact that, for now, the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration push has turned its sights elsewhere.

“If they come back and the situation on the ground changes, then we will have the grounds to file another lawsuit,” Art said.

Art also drew direct parallels to the litigation in Chicago and the tragedy currently unfolding in Minnesota.

“What this case has shown is that citizens on the street and the press can very quickly reveal whether or not the federal government is telling the truth when it engages with civilians in different jurisdictions,” Art said. “And I expect that to continue to happen, as we are seeing in Minneapolis right now.”

Shooting prompts local outrage Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence.","A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.

The shooting comes as the Trump administration has deployed about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the state's fraud scandal and immigration.

Here's more of what we've learned about the shooting so far.

Woman who was shot, Renee Good, was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen

The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time in a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.

Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.

The woman who was killed was identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, a mother of three who had recently moved to the area with her partner and 6-year-old son.

Her ex-husband told The Associated Press that Good had just dropped the child off at school and was driving home with her partner when she encountered the ICE agents.

She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News. Minnesota city leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.

She grew up in Colorado Springs as one of five children, her father, Timothy Granger, told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil. He said she had recently moved to Minneapolis to restart her life after what he described as an awful stretch following the sudden death of her second husband.

He described her as warm, witty, and with a bubbly personality, and as someone who always cared deeply about other people.

CBS affiliate KCTV in Kansas City spoke to a former neighbor who knew Good when she lived there until 2024. She said Good lived there with her partner, their young son and their dogs, and had two older children who visited routinely. She said she didn't know the family well but called them ""lovely neighbors.""

Good graduated from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 2020 with an English degree, the school said.

Feds say she was shot during ""targeted operations"" by ICE

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting ""targeted operations.""

McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several ""violent rioters"" who were ""blocking"" ICE officers.

According to McLaughlin, the woman ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

An ICE officer, ""fearing for his life,"" then ""fired defensive shots,"" McLaughlin said.

In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an ""act of domestic terrorism.""

Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and ""were attempting to push out their vehicle"" when ""a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.""

In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman ""viciously ran over the ICE Officer"" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.

Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims

Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.

In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account ""bull****.""

""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,"" Frey said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" Walz said. ""The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.

In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.

In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to ""get out of the f****** car"" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.

That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.

The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.

Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.

ICE officer part of specially trained tactical unit

A senior DHS official confirmed to CBS News that the agent who opened fire was a member of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Special Response Team — a specially trained tactical unit within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.

""The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,"" Noem said. ""He sustained injuries at that time as well.""

According to court records and the suspect's defense attorney from that June 17, 2025 incident, the agent's name is Jonathan Ross.

During that June incident, immigration officers in St. Paul were attempting to arrest a 39-year-old man previously convicted of sexually assaulting a minor, according to a senior DHS official.

According to the official, the suspect refused to roll his window down or get out of his car, so the officer broke a rear window and reached inside the car to unlock the door. At that point, the suspect drove off, dragging the officer approximately 100 yards with his arm inside the car. The suspect was accelerating and weaving to try to shake the officer off. The officer twice fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop him. He was eventually knocked free of the vehicle, and suffered significant lacerations that required 33 stitches, the official said. The suspect was later federally charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.

Court records show Ross has been working with ICE in Minnesota since at least 2017.

Will the officer face charges or discipline?

It was unclear if the officer would face any charges or discipline at the early stages of the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, however, criticized the Trump administration for allegedly cutting state investigators out of the process.

""The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the BCA, spent the day yesterday trying to get that accountability. We have learned that the Trump administration has now denied the state that ability to participate in the investigation,"" Walz said at a Thursday news conference.

""It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,"" he said of that decision, accusing Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Noem of making statements about the incident that are ""verifiably false.""

The BCA said in a statement it was initially invited to participate in the investigation but that the FBI later said it would be the sole lead and ""the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.""

""Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,"" the agency said.

Noem, however, said Thursday, ""They have not been cut out. They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.""

""This is an experienced officer who followed his training, and we will continue to let the investigation unfold into the individual and continue to follow the procedures and policies that happen in these use of force cases,"" she added.

Shooting prompts local outrage

Local residents took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest the shooting and ICE's presence. Many attended a vigil for Good, creating an impromptu memorial where the shooting occurred. Local officials implored those demonstrating to remain peaceful.

In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, ""get the f*** out of Minneapolis.""

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" the mayor said.

About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.

Walz in his Wednesday news conference said the state ""doesn't need any further help from the federal government.""

""To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,"" Walz said.

The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that ""ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.""

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is ""causing serious harm and spreading terror"" through the community.

Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday ""due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city."" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.

Walz on Thursday demanded federal agents ""stay out of our schools.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/07/faf641b7-1814-40d6-b269-7db7e842ee69/thumbnail/1200x630/2db65e0b0cf9f188c4ff80a7223fda0a/gettyimages-2254518279.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:59:36.410166

“They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do,” the woman says through sobs in the footage, with a damaged SUV visible in the distance behind her. ""We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” the woman cries.

“We have a 6-year-old at school,” she says, almost unable to breathe, as a chaotic scene in which federal officers prevented at least one doctor who was on the scene from assisting the shot victim unfolds. “We’re new here,” the distraught woman says in despair.

The video emerged hours after Good was fatally shot Wednesday morning near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue during what the Department of Homeland Security has described as its largest immigration enforcement surge ever in Minnesota. Roughly 2,000 federal agents have been deployed across the state as part of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

Good was identified late Wednesday by her mother, Donna Ganger, who told The Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter lived in the Twin Cities with her partner and was not involved in protests or any activity confronting ICE agents. Ganger said her family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.

“She was probably terrified,” Ganger told the paper. “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known. She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

Good was previously married a man named Timmy Ray Mackin, who died in 2023 at age 36, and had her son with him, according to the Star Tribune.

DHS has said that “rioters began blocking ICE officers” during what it called “targeted operations,” alleging that one person “weaponized” a vehicle, prompting an agent to fire what the agency described as “defensive shots.” The department characterized the killing as an act of self-defense and labeled the incident “domestic terrorism.”

But multiple videos circulating online appear to tell a different story. Separate footage shows a dark SUV attempting to drive away from the scene when three shots ring out, sending bystanders into panic. Moments later, the vehicle crashes into a light pole and parked cars as people scream and rush toward the wreckage. Authorities have not publicly reconciled those images with DHS’s account.

Late Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump weighed in on his social media site, Truth Social, claiming he had “just viewed the clip” and asserting that the woman filming was “obviously, a professional agitator” and that the driver had “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” calling the shooting an act of self-defense and blaming what he described as a “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate.”

Condemnation has grown from civil rights and advocacy groups nationwide.

Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson grieved with the Minneapolis community in a statement to The Advocate.

""Today, a woman was senselessly killed in Minneapolis during an ICE action — a brutal reminder that this agency and the Trump regime put every community at risk, spreading fear instead of safety,"" Robinson said. ""Reports that she may have been part of the LGBTQ+ community underscore how often the most vulnerable pay the highest price. Her family and the people of Minneapolis deserve a full investigation, real accountability, and decisive action. And we must remove ICE and their terror from all our communities before even more preventable violence occurs. As Governor Walz requested, we join the nation in standing with Minneapolis.”

Los Angeles LGBT Center CEO Joe Hollendoner also released the a statement, saying, ""The fatal shooting of Renee Good — an LGBTQ+ United States citizen exercising her right to protest ICE activity in Minneapolis—is a horrifying and senseless loss of life. Renee’s death lays bare the dangerous reality of an agency that continues to operate with impunity, fueled by a Trump administration that has normalized violence, cruelty, and the erosion of basic human rights. This is now the fifth known killing linked to ICE agents amid an aggressive escalation of raids and abuses. These are not isolated incidents — they are the predictable and devastating consequences of a federal agenda that treats immigrant communities, and those who stand in solidarity with them, as expendable.""

Amnesty International accused the Trump administration of “unnecessary lethal force,” of misrepresenting the circumstances, and of using militarized immigration crackdowns that have made communities unsafe.

Common Defense Executive Director Jose Vasquez said ICE’s “uninvited presence in Minneapolis is not only destabilizing, it is dangerous and deeply unjust,” calling the killing “heartbreaking and unforgivable.” He said the shooting reflects an “unnecessary escalation” and demanded ICE leave Minneapolis immediately.

Local leaders also pushed back forcefully. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters, “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,” while Gov. Tim Walz said the state would ensure a “full, fair, and expeditious investigation.”

Minnesota State Rep. Leigh Finke, the state’s first out transgender legislator, said the killing left her “heartbroken” and warned that the federal immigration surge had created the conditions for violence long before Wednesday’s shooting.

“My reaction is one of great sadness,” Finke told The Advocate. “For those of us here in Minnesota who’ve been seeing what these federal agents — ICE, CBP, others — have been doing and how they’ve been treating our communities and our neighbors, something like this felt very possible. But we’ve just had so many tragedies here. Waking up to this news was heartbreaking. It’s terrible. It’s one too many of these things.”

Finke said the sudden influx of roughly 2,000 federal agents announced earlier this week created an inherently volatile situation.

“That kind of influx of law enforcement, often untrained young people coming in with a mandate to kidnap neighbors and abduct people and deport them, violence is the only way that something like that can go at some point or another,” she said, adding that what happened to Good was “devastating” and “the kind of violence being bred by our federal government.”

Finke also called for accountability, saying state law enforcement must “arrest the killer and prosecute that person to the fullest extent of the law,” even as legislative options are constrained by Minnesota’s divided legislature.

And in a message to Minnesotans shaken by the shooting, Finke urged solidarity, noting that immigrant, transgender, and LGBTQ+ communities are bearing the brunt of the federal crackdown.

“We all need to remember that we are in this together,” she said. “We are going to continue to fight for it. We are going to stand up nonviolently with peace and love and fight for our communities no matter what.”

The Advocate has contacted Walz and Minneapolis city officials, including Frey and the police department, for comment.

Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters gathered in Good's neighborhood for a vigil and march. “She was peaceful, she did the right thing,” Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of CAIR-MN, said at the event, the Star Tribune reports. “She died because she loved her neighbors.”

Another speaker at the event, identified only as Noah, denounced those who called Good a domestic terrorist. Instead, he said, Good was watching the terrorists.

A Minnesota woman sitting in the snow with her dog told a person filming her that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had just shot and killed her wife — now identified as Renee Nicole Good, 37 — according to newly circulating video that has intensified scrutiny of a fatal federal shooting during a sweeping immigration enforcement operation in south Minneapolis on Wednesday.

“They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do,” the woman says through sobs in the footage, with a damaged SUV visible in the distance behind her. ""We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” the woman cries.

“We have a 6-year-old at school,” she says, almost unable to breathe, as a chaotic scene in which federal officers prevented at least one doctor who was on the scene from assisting the shot victim unfolds. “We’re new here,” the distraught woman says in despair.

The video emerged hours after Good was fatally shot Wednesday morning near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue during what the Department of Homeland Security has described as its largest immigration enforcement surge ever in Minnesota. Roughly 2,000 federal agents have been deployed across the state as part of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

Good was identified late Wednesday by her mother, Donna Ganger, who told The Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter lived in the Twin Cities with her partner and was not involved in protests or any activity confronting ICE agents. Ganger said her family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.

“She was probably terrified,” Ganger told the paper. “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known. She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

Good was previously married a man named Timmy Ray Mackin, who died in 2023 at age 36, and had her son with him, according to the Star Tribune.

DHS has said that “rioters began blocking ICE officers” during what it called “targeted operations,” alleging that one person “weaponized” a vehicle, prompting an agent to fire what the agency described as “defensive shots.” The department characterized the killing as an act of self-defense and labeled the incident “domestic terrorism.”

The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data.","Despite vows to restrict immigration authorities’ access to Washington state Department of Licensing information, the data sharing continued in a new form, researchers revealed Thursday.

The University of Washington Center for Human Rights reports that federal immigration agents searched Department of Licensing data before stopping drivers at least nine times between August and November.

State officials say they cut off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to this data in mid-November.

In a joint statement, the licensing department and Washington State Patrol said Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action” in the face of the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement tactics.

“But he will do so with reason and care,” the agencies said. “Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law-enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety.”

The researchers say U.S. Customs and Border Protection still has access to the data, but the state argues that’s necessary for the agency’s work at the Canadian border and airports.

The state’s Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, prevents state data from being shared with federal authorities for civil immigration purposes. Washington is one of 19 states that offer driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status.

Concerns over federal access to this state data date back to at least 2018. But the worries have ramped up in the past year as President Donald Trump has pushed for drastic increases in immigration enforcement and deportations. The Trump administration has focused on accessing various troves of state data to apparently fuel its immigration operations.

Over the summer, KING 5 revealed continued data sharing through the Department of Licensing’s driver and plate database, known as DAPS. The investigation found hundreds of searches of Washington records after Trump retook office, prompting outcries from immigration advocates.

After this, state officials announced they’d stop ICE from accessing Washington’s driver license data through this avenue.

Malou Chávez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s “clear that there are cracks in systems here in Washington state that need fixing to truly protect our communities.”

“Washington, as a welcoming state, cannot and should not aid the federal government in its goal of mass detention, mass deportation by providing access to information, allowing our data to be used for civil immigration enforcement when we have laws specifically prohibiting this from happening,” she told reporters.

How it works

The form of data sharing revealed Thursday forces federal agencies to use a different route than the one that drew scrutiny last year.

It’s facilitated by a nonprofit that police agencies use to share driver’s license data across states. This allows them to easily search through a platform known as Nlets for information on drivers from out of state that officers pull over.

A Washington State Patrol platform called ACCESS allows users into the state’s data held by Nlets. The Department of Licensing data shared through this platform includes drivers’ license numbers and photos, home addresses and vehicles’ registered owners, according to the UW researchers.

So, for example, agents could stake out a business, run the license plates of all the cars parked there to get the owners’ names, then look up their immigration statuses and arrest them.

The UW center’s report includes instances where the licensing department information has been used.

In one case in November, ICE agents saw a Washington resident in Oregon leaving a Latino grocer. They ran his license plate through the Washington State Patrol system, then searched his name through their own database and found he wasn’t authorized to be in the country, according to the report.

Federal authorities pulled over his vehicle and arrested him, according to researchers.

“These folks are real Washingtonians who have been affected,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. “They are people with lives and families and communities and rights, and they have been harmed by the fact that the DOL allows these agencies to access its data for civil and not criminal immigration enforcement.”

Call for action

In November, Democrats in Congress alerted many states that they were unknowingly sharing information with ICE.

In letters to the states’ governors, they noted Washington, along with Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, had blocked ICE access to their driver’s license data. They wrote that Washington made the move after “engaging with Congressional Democrats.”

Washington state officials said “thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied” since shutting off access to Nlets data on Nov. 19.

But this still leaves the door open for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE subagency, to continue searching Washington’s data, the UW researchers believe.

Customs and Border Protection conducted the data searches in eight of the nine arrests the center documented. Almost all of the arrests were for civil immigration enforcement, not criminal matters. Though when searching the data, the federal agencies don’t need to note if it’s for a criminal or civil investigation.

“The state is granting them that access on the good faith assumption that they’re only going to use it for criminal investigations, and the data that we’ve presented here shows that that is not the case,” Godoy said. “They are using it in ways that are contrary to state law.”

The researchers called on the state to block all federal immigration authorities from accessing Washington’s Nlets data.

“We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety,” reads the statement from the Department of Licensing and state patrol.

In an executive order in September, Ferguson ordered state agencies to “continue to review their data collection, sharing, and retention policies to ensure they are treating the protection of residents’ personal and private information as a matter of public interest and safety.”

The letters to governors, led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said that in the year preceding Oct. 1, federal immigration authorities searched driver’s license databases roughly 900,000 times across the country.

The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data. Godoy said the nine cases documented so far “likely represent the tip of the iceberg.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ice-officer-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:59:55.512369

The data was gathered by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR).

The nine cases in the report were Washington drivers who were subjected to immigration enforcement while driving, following a search of their license plate number in the Washington Department of Licensing (DOL)’s database by federal agents. These agents used a national data-sharing platform called Nlets, made possible through the Washington State Patrol (WSP)’s ACCESS platform, according to UWCHR.

""In at least seven of these cases, UWCHR researchers were able to confirm that the arrests were acts of civil immigration enforcement,"" the UWCHR report said.

""While state authorities now claim to have curtailed access by one of ICE’s sub-agencies to DOL data via ACCESS, in eight of the nine confirmed cases discussed in this report, it was CBP, not ICE, who conducted the query. There is therefore no reason to believe that this process does not continue to date,"" the report continued.

DOL and WSP jointly submitted feedback in response to the draft report, shared with the Governor’s Office last Friday, according to the statement.

""ICE access to Nlets was shut off on November 19,"" the joint statement said.

The Governor’s Office directed WSP and DOL to shut off ICE’s access to DOL data through Nlets as early as Nov 7, 2025, the statement further claimed.

However, it took longer than anticipated for WSP’s data vendor to implement that change, and ICE’s access to Nlets was finally blocked on the morning of Nov. 19.

WSP confirmed that since shutting off ICE access to DOL data through Nlets, thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied.

TIMELINE OF IMMIGRATION ARRESTS, CASES IN THE REPORT

The first of the nine confirmed cases the report covers occurred on Aug. 22, 2025.

ICE records show that ICE ERO, ICE HSI, and USBP officers went to a residential address in Edmonds to look for a person they believed to be undocumented.

In the second case, the arrest occurred on Sept. 20, 2025. ICE records show that agents observed a truck and, according to the documents, “Seattle ERO conducted a registration query on a 2103 Ford F-150 with Washington license plate number XXXXXXX.""

In the fourth documented case, the arrest occurred on Oct 4, 2025. ICE records state that an arrest team located a vehicle, and agents conducted a registration query using the car’s license plate, obtaining the registered owner’s name.

The last arrest was reported on Nov. 16, 2025. A Washington resident was in Gresham, Oregon, for work, and had just left a Latino grocery store when ICE officers spotted him.

From Jan. 1, 2025, to Nov. 30, 2025, federal agencies used ACCESS/Nlets to query WA DOL data a total of 2,671,776 times, according to data provided by DOL to UWCHR.

The number represents the use of Washington resources to conduct civil immigration enforcement; the figure includes the verification of documents at U.S.-Canadian border crossings and many other lawful purposes, the report said.

The cases verified by UWCHR researchers likely form part of a much broader pattern of federal agents tapping into WA DOL data to target Washingtonians for arrest for civil immigration violations.

COMMUNITY CONCERNS

The sharing platform, called Nlets, is different than Flock camera systems.

""It's not Flock focused, but it's looking at the data sharing system Nlets and ongoing WA Dept of Licensing - ICE/CBP data sharing, allowing federal immigration enforcement to obtain WA driver data to assist them in immigration arrests,"" a UWCHR researcher said.

Due to increased community concerns about data collection, access, and privacy protections, several cities across western Washington decided to deactivate their FLOCK cameras late last year.

In October 2025, the City of Auburn announced that any agency found using Auburn's Flock data for immigration enforcement will have its access permanently revoked.

""The types of enforcement we have seen in recent months—warrantless arrests by unidentified masked men driving unmarked vehicles, sometimes accompanied by acts of shocking violence—threaten the civil liberties of all Washingtonians,"" the report said in its recommendations to the state.

While in official statements she has expressed her willingness to work “jointly” with the United States, in speeches such as the one delivered Wednesday she insisted that the opposition’s extremism has led the country to “kneel” before foreign governments.
In that vein, Rodríguez, who until now had not addressed the opposition, stated that “the wound of January 3” was fueled by the opposition’s “fascist” elements.
“Extremism has led them to offer to bring our country to its knees and compromise our resources,” she added.","Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez alluded on Wednesday to Donald Trump’s announcement that oil revenues would henceforth be used exclusively to purchase American products, stating that “it is not unusual or irregular that economic relations exist between the United States and Venezuela.” She made these remarks during a meeting at Miraflores Palace with a delegation of members of the new National Assembly, including opposition figures Stalin González and Antonio Ecarri.

According to Rodríguez, “71% of Venezuelan exports go to eight countries and 27% to the United States.” She added there will be no supervised investments because “Venezuela must have economic relations with all countries in the hemisphere,” without specifically mentioning Trump.

The new Venezuelan president referred to the “kidnapping” of Nicolás Maduro as “a stain” that contaminates the relationship between the two countries and asserted that drug trafficking and human rights “were an excuse” for the U.S. intervention, “because the real motive is Venezuelan oil.” On Wednesday, the state-owned oil company PDVSA announced the existence of trade negotiations with the United States, just four days after the capture of the Chavista leader and his wife, Cilia Flores.

However, the official discourse emphasized Venezuela’s commercial sovereignty over third parties: “Energy resources must serve our development and that of other countries around the world,” Rodríguez said. “We are an energy powerhouse. It has brought us tremendous problems because of the energy voracity of the Global North.”

In recent days, the president has issued contradictory rhetoric. While in official statements she has expressed her willingness to work “jointly” with the United States, in speeches such as the one delivered Wednesday she insisted that the opposition’s extremism has led the country to “kneel” before foreign governments.

In that vein, Rodríguez, who until now had not addressed the opposition, stated that “the wound of January 3” was fueled by the opposition’s “fascist” elements. “A parliament at the service of foreign governments cannot be tolerated, nor can fascist social expressions be allowed, as they have been extremely dangerous for the Republic,” she asserted. “Extremism has led them to offer to bring our country to its knees and compromise our resources,” she added. While launching her attacks against the opposition, Rodríguez offered to initiate “a dialogue to heal the wound left in our people [by the U.S. intervention], which was supported and promoted by Venezuelan fascism and extremism.”

Almost simultaneously with the president’s speech, the other strongman of her government, Diosdado Cabello, stated on his program on state television that the number of deaths on the night of January 3 stood at 100, significantly raising the previously known figure of 32 Venezuelan military personnel, 24 Cubans, and two civilian women.

On the same program, Cabello insisted that the U.S. operation had not initially planned to take Cilia Flores, “the first combatant,” as she is known in Chavista rhetoric, but that it was she who, out of loyalty to her husband, said: “If you take him, take me too.” “In this way, she saved his life,” the minister said.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/VPAF3CZMYNNBXHI4FLQ3AEKFWM.jpg?auth=a276909091cdef282eeccf4b8da71360a8407cc149a3b0f3b2299f87e3d1779a&width=1200,N,,2026-01-08 18:00:06.751335

Josh Hawley, one of the five Republican votes. ""If the president should determine, 'You know what? I need to put troops on the ground of Venezuela.' I think that would require Congress to weigh in.""

The other Republicans who backed the resolution were Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Todd Young of Indiana.

Democrats had failed to pass several such resolutions in the months that Trump escalated his campaign against Venezuela. But lawmakers argued that now that Trump has captured Maduro and set his sights to other conquests such as Greenland, the vote presents the Republican-controlled Congress with an opportunity.

""It's time for Congress to assert its control over military action of this kind, and it's time to get this out of secrecy and put it in the light,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who forced the vote.

Lawmakers' response to the Venezuela operation

Republican leaders have said they had no advance notification of the raid early morning Saturday to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, but mostly expressed satisfaction this week as top administration officials provided classified briefings on the operation.

The administration has used an evolving set of legal justifications for the monthslong campaign in Central and South America, from destroying alleged drug boats under authorizations for the global fight against terrorism to seizing Maduro in what was ostensibly a law enforcement operation to put him on trial in the United States.

Republican leaders have backed Trump.

""I think the president has demonstrated at least already a very strong commitment to peace through strength, especially in this hemisphere,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. ""I think Venezuela got that message loudly and clearly.""

A vote on a similar resolution in November narrowly failed to gain the majority needed for passage. Paul and Murkowski were the only Republicans voting in favor then.

Paul, an outspoken proponent of war powers resolutions, acknowledged that Maduro is seen as a ""bad guy"" and ""a socialist and an autocrat."" But, Paul added, ""The question is about who has the power to take the country to war?""

Some progressive Democrats have suggested inserting language in a defense appropriations bill to limit certain military actions, but that idea met resistance from more pragmatic members of the caucus. Democratic leaders have tried to cast Trump's foreign ambitions as a distraction from the issues that voters face at home.

""The American people are asking what the hell is going on in Venezuela and why is this president, who campaigned on 'America First,' now spending all his time and energy on escapades overseas?"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a floor speech.

House Democrats were also introducing a similar resolution on Thursday.

The rarely enforced War Powers Act

Congress was once again left in the dark during the military operation in Venezuela, with Trump later confirming that he talked to oil executives but not leaders on Capitol Hill. That reflects a broader pattern in Trump's second term, unfolding under a Republican-controlled Congress that has shown little appetite for reasserting its constitutional authority to declare war.

Under the Constitution, Congress declares war while the president serves as commander in chief. But lawmakers have not formally declared war since World War II, granting presidents broad latitude to act unilaterally.

Congress attempted to rein in that authority after the Vietnam War with the War Powers Resolution, passed over Republican President Richard Nixon's veto. The law requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces and to end military action within 60 to 90 days absent authorization — limits that presidents of both parties have routinely stretched.

Democrats argue those limits are being pushed further than ever. Some Republicans have gone further still, contending congressional approval is unnecessary altogether.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally who traveled with the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday, said he would be comfortable with Trump taking over other countries without congressional approval, including Greenland.

""The commander in chief is the commander in chief. They can use military force,"" Graham said.

Greenland may further test the limits

Graham's comments come as the administration weighs not only its next steps in Venezuela, but also Greenland. The White House has said the ""military is always an option"" when it comes to a potential American takeover of the world's largest island.

While Republicans have cited Greenland's strategic value, most have balked at the idea of using the military to take the country, instead favoring a potential deal to purchase the country.

Democrats want to get out in front of any military action and are already preparing to respond. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego said he is working on a resolution ""to block Trump from invading Greenland.""

""We must stop him before he invades another country on a whim,"" Gallego wrote on X. ""No more forever wars.""

Kaine also said Wednesday that a resolution on Greenland would soon be filed, in addition to Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Nigeria.

Greenland belongs to a NATO ally, Denmark, which has prompted a much different response from Republican senators than the situation in Venezuela. Paul said Republicans discussed Trump's plans for Greenland at their Wednesday luncheon and he heard ""zero support"" for taking military action to seize it.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, used a Senate floor speech to criticize White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller for comments this week that the U.S. should take control of Greenland. Tillis said such remarks were ""amateurish"" and ""absurd.""

""This nonsense on what's going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he's doing,"" Tillis said of the president. ""And the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-05T221653Z_154738508_RC27VIAV3N0A_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:58:40.933099

In these darkest of times, people of good conscience in the United States must stand tall and resist this authoritarianism that seeks to wreck all that is good at home and to export its carnage around the earth.","Last Sunday, Stephen Miller, the chief wingman to the newly minted neo-imperialist Donald Trump, wrote an extraordinary post on X. For its brazen rewriting of history, it is worth reading in full:

None of this is true: The 18th and 19th century colonial projects were never about making the natives wealthy and successful‚ any more than slavery was about improving the condition of the slaves—a ludicrous and offensive position that Lost Cause advocates still argue. Colonialism was—and is—about the use of raw power to accumulate more power, more resources, more markets, more military bases, and more cheap and expendable labor. Miller’s “reverse colonization,” or—to use language not borrowed from Nazis such as Anders Breivik—a more liberal, race-neutral immigration system, never gave preferential treatment to new residents or naturalized citizens, but it did attract labor and talent and investments and dreamers from across the world.

Allowing more immigration was—and is—not about “self-punishment”; it’s about keeping countries economically dynamic. Immigrants—be they refugees, asylum seekers, or any other visa holders—start companies, provide needed medical and homecare skills, staff child care centers, and pick the crops that homegrown populations have long since decided they don’t want to pick. Take away immigration and remove immigrants, and you have a smaller, meaner, narrower, and poorer culture left behind.

Of course, the fact that Miller’s white-supremacist philosophy is based on lies and historically untenable claims should surprise no one. This is a political regime that, like all authoritarian regimes, thrives on misinformation and a Stalinesque rewriting of history to suit the needs of the moment. Witness the efforts by the White House this week around the fifth anniversary of the Trump-inspired insurrection to recast the murderous MAGA mob as peace-loving protesters attacked by the Capitol police at the behest of Nancy Pelosi. There is a Goebbels-like quality to their realization that if you simply repeat the Big Lie loudly and frequently enough, it will gain traction. They have embraced the Orwellian notion that if you use the levers of state power to maximize your propaganda, a shockingly large number of people will eventually accept that two-plus-two equals five.

For Lucan Way, a distinguished professor of democracy at the University of Toronto who has been writing on America’s slide into “competitive authoritarianism,” the GOP’s collaboration with Trump’s rewrite of January 6 is the clearest indication that the party as a whole has abandoned its commitment to democracy. “The GOP’s open embrace of authoritarianism is,” he said, “the most important fact of the American political system.”

Way believes that the United States has been functionally authoritarian since March, when Trump 2.0 began its onslaught against law firms that represented Democrats and advocacy organizations and against universities that the administration argued were too “woke” in their approach to academics. “In a democracy, we can oppose the government, and we don’t face a cost to our careers. In an authoritarian regime, you have to worry about contracts, about being investigated by the DOJ. That’s clearly the case in the US.”

This week, the fanaticism and authoritarianism of Miller, the fluffer-in-chief for Trump’s masturbatory fantasies of aggrandizement, has been on full display. In addition to embracing Breivik’s foul anti-immigration creed, he also espoused Hitler’s philosophy of international relations. “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” he declared, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in which he asserted that the United States would seize Greenland and its vast mineral resources, refusing to rule out the use of military force to accomplish that aim. “These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”

In other words, we are big and have a military with almost unlimited capacity to inflict harm, so—be you allies like Denmark or longtime foes like Venezuela—bend to our will or expect to get the shit kicked out of you.

Might is right is the philosophy behind the Trump administration’s decision to kidnap the admittedly odious leader of Venezuela, to hold a gun to the head of the remaining leadership after that act of international piracy, and to promptly steal tens of millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil—to be sold by the United States on the open market with the profits personally controlled by one Donald J. Trump. What is unfolding is no different from the Elizabethan era privateers who, with government support, would ransack ships on the high seas, steal their treasures, and head back to England to add to the riches of the country’s crown.

Pretty it up with statements about investment opportunities for hedge funds, oil companies, and other corporate raiders, and you’re still left with the taste of vinegar in your mouth. The raid into Venezuela was never about restoring democracy or protecting human rights or raising the quality of life for the tens of millions of Venezuelans who have languished under Maduro’s nutty dictatorship—it was always about the United States enriching itself on another country’s oil reserves. “This is not America First,” Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts noted. “This is Authoritarianism First.”

And if Trump goes next into Colombia or Cuba or Panama or even Denmark, you can bet your bottom crypto dollar that it will also have zero to do with human rights and everything to do with accessing resources that America’s gold-and-baubles-obsessed modern-day Midas craves.

“They’re not pushing for democracy or economic development or peace,” said Antonia Juhasz, an investigative journalist who has written several books on the oil industry and the influence that that industry exerts over US politics. “It was all about getting Maduro out,” and then installing a deputy who will do the United States’ bidding when it comes to oil demands.

Ad Policy

While the United States has fought many wars over oil, Juhasz told me that past administrations felt that they had to at least produce some sort of fictive justification under international law. “What makes it [the attack on Venezuela] different is the Trump administration is making no effort to abide by international law at all. This is a very public action; it’s not a secret mission. It’s the public removal of the president of another country without any feint toward legality.” And that opens the door to a 21st-century jungle in which the strongest simply consume the weak.

For Juhasz, what we are seeing is the consolidation of an informal alliance of authoritarians whose power is propped up by the vast amounts of money generated by the fossil fuel industry. “The Trump administration’s effort to control the Western Hemisphere and to do that through energy and to prop up fossil fuels further aligns Trump with his favorite authoritarians, Putin and Mohammed bin Salman. It divides up the world into spheres, which allows authoritarians to dominate their spheres of influence.”

This is what American authoritarianism looks and sounds like. It is an ugly beast from head to toe.

As I wrapped up this column, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot dead a peaceful protester as she was attempting to drive away after blocking a road to ICE vehicles. Witnesses say that when they tried to help her, armed ICE officers prevented them from reaching the scene. It is a tragedy that has been in the making for the past year. The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, made a furious speech in response. “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis,” Frey said. “People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart…and now, somebody is dead. That’s on you. And it’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure further damage, further loss of life and limb is not done.” He denounced ICE’s claim that the agent fired in self-defense as “garbage,” as was Kristi Noem’s absurd attempted justification of the killing by labelling the victim a “domestic terrorist.”

I hope that Frey’s message is heard. I fear, instead, that the federal government is going to ramp up its military occupation of cities.

Here's a recap of the Trump administration's comments about the fatal shooting in Minneapolis

Vice-president JD Vance appeared at the White House news briefing today, and repeated claims that the ICE agent who killed Renee Nicole Good was acting in “self-defense”. Vance said that Good, 37, was “dead because she tried to ram somebody with her car”, and claimed, baselessly, that she was part of a “left wing network” of people trying to incite violence against federal law enforcement officers. The vice-president further defended the ICE agent in question, by noting that he was “dragged by a car six months ago” and might be “a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile”.

At a press conference in New York today, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem continued to say that the shooting was in response to an “act of domestic terrorism”. Noem said that the officer who killed Good was “following his training” when he shot the 37-year-old. She added that the ICE agent “was hit by the vehicle, went to hospital and received treatment, was released, and is spending time with his family now” before noting that he is an “experienced officer”. Noem also said she was “not opposed” to sending more federal immigration agents to Minneapolis “to keep people safe”.

As demonstrations in response to Wednesdays’s shooting continue throughout the state, attorney general Pam Bondi warned protesting Minnesotans to “not test our resolve”. She said that “obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement is a federal crime” and noted that those who “cross that red line” will be “arrested and prosecuted”.

After news of the shooting, Donald Trump spoke with the New York Times and insisted that Good “behaved horribly”. According to the four reporters in the room, Trump replayed the eyewitness video of the incident. “She didn’t try to run him over, she ran him over,” he said. However, multiple angles of the shooting show Good reversing her car and letting at least one ICE vehicle pass before an officer tells her to get out of the car, she then tries to turn and drive away. The agent shoots her multiple times, remains on his feet and walks away apparently uninjured as her car crashes into a lamp-post and parked vehicle.

Walz authorizes national guard to prepare to deploy

Minnesota governor Tim Walz has authorized the state’s national guard troops “to be staged and ready to support local and state law enforcement in protecting critical infrastructure and maintaining public safety”.

“Minnesotans have met this moment. Thousands of people have peacefully made their voices heard. Minnesota: thank you. We saw powerful peace,” Walz said in a statement annnouncing the order. “We have every reason to believe that peace will hold. Yesterday, I directed the National Guard to be ready should they be needed. They remain ready in the event they are needed to help keep the peace, ensure public safety, and allow for peaceful demonstrations.”

Earlier in the day, lieutenant governor Peggy Flanagan told CNN the guard was on standby “out of an abundance of caution” although demonstrations had been peaceful so far.

Republicans, including Donald Trump, criticized Walz after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by saying the governor should have deployed the state’s national guard sooner.

In a statement, Walz said the Minnesota State Patrol has also mobilized 85 state troopers.

Here’s more on the House vote to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies from my colleague Chris Stein:

All Democrats voted for the measure along with 17 Republicans, many of whom were moderates who said they could not tolerate a hike in healthcare costs for their constituents, but acknowledged the House measure will likely be revised by the Republican-controlled Senate before it is enacted .

“I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate, so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Republican congressman Mike Lawler said during a preliminary vote on the bill on Wednesday.

Trump has opposed extending the tax credits, and the Senate last month rejected a Democratic-backed measure similar to the bill that passed the House. Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the plans will roughly double without the subsidies.

The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits , arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”. Democrats made an extension to a centerpiece of their demands during the record-long government shutdown that began in October, while moderate Republicans sought to strike a compromise that would be palatable to both parties.

But after Johnson refused to bring any deal to the floor, four Republicans last month signed a discharge petition that forced a vote on the legislation extending the credits for three years, in a significant rebuke of the speaker.

House bill passes to extend ACA subsidies

The House of Representatives has passed legislation that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies, 230-196, with a handful of Republicans joining with Democrats to pass the measure despite opposition from Republican leadership.

“Health care costs have skyrocketed for millions of families and this legislation will help bring costs down. This is a win for the American people,” the House Democratic Caucus wrote in a social media post.

The legislation would extend ACA subsidies by three years. The bill will now move to the Senate where pressure to pass a similar bipartisan healthcare agreement is growing.

Minnesota officials expressed frustration with the FBI and Justice Department’s decision to block the state from participating in an investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, and are considering ways the state might undertake its own investigation.

“We want to make sure that there is a check on this administration to ensure that this investigation is done for justice, not for the sake of a cover up,” said Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey.

Hennepin County attorney Mary Moriarty said her office is “exploring all options to ensure a state level investigation can continue” and that they’re “speaking to our local partners on paths forward.”

A bipartisan group of lawmakers has asked a US District Court to appoint a special master to compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. A special master is a neutral, third-party official appointed by a judge to make sure judicial orders are followed.

Congressmembers Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, sent a letter to Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York requesting the appointment.

“The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files. Millions of files are being kept from the public,” Khanna said in a press release announcing the letter. “The DOJ has failed to make the necessary redactions to protect survivors while removing records after publication without any explanation. That is why we are requesting the appointment of a Special Master to oversee the release of the files and ensure that the DOJ is following the law.”

“Attorney General Pam Bondi is egregiously violating the requirements of the Epstein Files Transparency Act,” said Massie. “Under her leadership, the Department of Justice is missing statutory disclosure deadlines, making excessive redactions, and illegally withholding the Department’s internal communications. Because the Department of Justice has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law, a Special Master should be appointed to oversee the release of the Epstein files.”

Khanna and Massie wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to release the files by 19 December.

Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term late last month, nixing two measures to fund a Colorado drinking water project and the protection of part of the Everglades in Florida.

The bills were uncontroversial enough to pass Congress unanimously, but Republicans in the House of Representatives just declined to override the vetoes, a reminder that the president retains significant sway over GOP lawmakers despite high-profile setbacks over the Jeffrey Epstein case and Affordable Care Act subsidies.

The House needed a two-thirds majority to undo the vetoes, but the Florida measure received only 236 in favor and 188 opposed, while the Colorado bill picked up 248 in favor and 177 against - not enough, in either case, to undo the president’s rejections.

Both vetoes appear to be retaliatory actions by Trump against parties who have defied him. In the Colorado case, the water project lay in the district of Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert, one of the lawmakers who had championed the bill to release the Epstein files.

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability,” Boebert said in a statement to a local broadcaster after the veto.

In the Florida case, the protected area is inhabited by the Miccosukee Tribe of Native Americans, which has clashed with Trump over the “Alligator Alcatraz” migrant detention facility that lies elsewhere in the Everglades.

In his final state of the state address, California Governor Gavin Newsom assailed the Trump administration for inciting a “carnival of chaos,” warning: “None of this is normal.”

“In Washington, the president believes that might makes right, that the courts are simply speed bumps, not stop signs, and that democracy is a nuisance to be circumvented,” Newsom said in his address, speaking from the state Capitol in Sacramento to a joint session of the legislature.

Referencing Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown, he continued: “Secret police, businesses being raided, windows smashed, citizens detained, Citizens shot, masked men snatching people in broad daylight, people disappearing, using American cities as training grounds for the United States military.”

Newsom, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028, has governed California through historic periods of crisis that overlapped with the end of Trump’s first term, and the first years of his second, as well as the pandemic and the LA fires.

In his address, Newsom cast the state as an American “marvel” and a bulwark against the “twisted nostalgia” of the Trump administration. Pre-empting some of the criticism he will surely face from Republicans should he seek the White House, Newsom argued vigorously that his state still leads the country - and the world - in culture, technology, education and agriculture.

“Every year, the declinists, the pundits and critics suffering from California derangement syndrome look at this state and try to tear down our progress,” he said, touting an environment that has created the “conditions where dreamers and doers and misfits and marvelers with grit and ingenuity get to build and do the impossible”.

As if offering a bit of advice to a potential presidential campaign, the president’s tormentor-in-chief said: “If we’re going to keep the faith of the California spirit we’ve got to do more than just resist what is wrong.”

“We’re not defined by what we’re against,” he added. “We’re defined by what we’re for.”

Today, the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution to display a commemorative plaque to honor Capitol police and other officers who defended Congress during the January 6 riots.

The plaque will be placed in the Senate wing of the US Capitol until it is permanently installed on building’s west front.

Despite a law approving the plaque’s display passing three years ago, it has never been officially hung. Today, outgoing senator Thom Tillis brought the resolution to the floor, which received no objection by lawmakers.

According to court records, Ross was involved in the June arrest of Roberto Carlos Muñoz, an undocumented Mexican immigrant with an open immigration detainer and a criminal conviction for sexually assaulting his 16-year-old stepdaughter in 2022.

Muñoz was contacted at his residence in Bloomington, Minnesota, by a group of federal agents on 19 June 2025.

According to an affidavit from an FBI agent, Muñoz was in his car when federal law enforcement approached him. He did not comply with commands to get out of his vehicle and drove away. The feds pursued Muñoz and conducted a traffic stop. An enforcement and removal operation (ERO) agent and an FBI agent approached the car and ordered Muñoz in both English and Spanish to put the car in park and provide documentation, which he did. When the ERO agent ordered Muñoz to exit the car, he refused.

At this point, according to the affidavit, the ERO agent broke the rear driver’s side window of Muñoz’s car and tried to unlock the driver’s door.

Muñoz threw the car into drive, speeding off with the agent trapped in the vehicle by his arm and dragged behind the car for 100 yards down the street along the curb, weaving past several cars. The agent was jarred loose from the window, and fell into the street, and Muñoz drove off. The agent suffered serious lacerations on both arms, which required 33 stitches in total to close.

At the White House on Thursday, Vance engaged in a lengthy defense of the officer’s actions and said: “[T]hat very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg. So you think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile.” The court documents indicate the stitches were on Ross’s arms and hand, not his leg.

Mr. Trump said in an Oval Office interview with New York Times reporters that he was “not happy” about a September raid that detained 475 workers, mostly from South Korea, who were building a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Mr. Trump argued that foreigners attempting to expand U.S. operations in globally competitive sectors would be dissuaded by such hostile treatment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 475 people in the raid.

“You have to allow them to bring some of their experts with them or they’re never going to be able to open their plant or factory,” he said of foreign companies in specialized industries that were looking to operate in the United States.

“They brought people that make batteries,” he added about the Hyundai raid. “And those people would have trained our people how to make batteries, and at some point they would have gone back because they want to go back to their country.”

While Mr. Trump presented his views as business-minded pragmatism, they contrasted sharply with those espoused by Mr. Miller, who has called for limiting immigration across the board, with few exceptions for highly skilled workers in competitive sectors.

When asked if that meant he disagreed with Mr. Miller, Mr. Trump did not criticize his aide personally, calling Mr. Miller “a very strong voice” in his administration.

“He feels that people who come into our country should be able to love our county and be able to contribute,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Miller, skipping over Mr. Miller’s hard-line approach to immigrants, including naturalized citizens, and their children.

While much of Mr. Miller’s efforts have focused on deporting immigrants without legal authorization to be in the United States, he also has pushed for the Trump administration to significantly limit the distribution of skilled worker visas and green cards, arguing they pose a threat to U.S.-born workers.

Earlier this year, Mr. Miller also set a target of 3,000 immigration arrests per day, which some have cited as a factor in driving I.C.E. to conduct large-scale workplace raids like the one that rounded up the Hyundai workers in Georgia.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08trump-miller-zwcv/08trump-miller-zwcv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:58:55.058217

Sakshi Venkatraman

A US immigration agent has shot dead a 37-year-old woman in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.

Federal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly.

Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. The FBI is investigating.

Hundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the White House's crackdown on illegal immigration.

Using an expletive, the city's Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey urged the agents to leave the city, following the fatal shooting.

Minneapolis shooting live updates

Videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time on Wednesday morning.

From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis.

A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the pavement.

Law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. ICE agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.

Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle.

It's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC.

That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.

The vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked nearby along the street.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was ""viciously"" run over. ""It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,"" he wrote.

The Republican president also blamed the ""Radical Left"" for ""threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis"".

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said the driver was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, ""and she began to drive off"".

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was ""stalking and impeding"" officers throughout the day and tried to ""weaponise her vehicle"" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of ""domestic terrorism"".

The federal agent fired ""defensive shots"" and was himself injured, Noem said, before he was treated and discharged from a local hospital.

The Minneapolis City Council, however, said in a statement that Good was simply ""caring for her neighbours"" when she was shot and killed.

The same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June, Noem said.

She added that ICE operations in the city would continue, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident.

Emily Heller told CNN she was at home when she saw the ICE agents arguing with protesters outside. She said she heard agents shouting at a woman driving an SUV, then one agent tried to open her car door, and the driver went into reverse and began pulling away.

""An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, 'Stop!' and then - I mean, she was already moving - and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,"" Heller told the US network.

Minnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting.

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

Top Democrats, including former Vice-President Kamala Harris and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events ""gaslighting"".

Protests and marches took place in several parts of the city as some outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave.

The scene of the shooting is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.

Protests were being organised in other US cities, including New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.

Minneapolis Public Schools announced that classes were cancelled for the rest of the week, ""due to safety concerns"". It comes after federal agents reportedly made arrests outside a high school on Wednesday.

Why is ICE in Minneapolis?

The Trump administration deployed an additional 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in response to allegations of welfare fraud in the state.

The mayor said in the Wednesday press conference that ICE was not making the city safer. ""They're ripping families apart, they're sowing chaos in our streets,"" he said.

The deployment, which began on Sunday, is one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in a US city in recent years.

It follows an immigration enforcement campaign launched by ICE late last year to target individuals in Minneapolis who were issued deportation orders, including members of the city's Somali community.

That community has been criticised frequently by Trump, who has called them ""garbage"".

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" the president has said. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

Trump later doubled-down on his remarks after a YouTube video by a conservative online content creator accused daycare centres run by Somali immigrants of mass fraud.

In response, Trump has withheld federal childcare funds from the state of Minnesota.

The Trump administration has sent ICE agents to other cities across the US, where they have made thousands of arrests as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the country.

They shouted ""No More ICE,"" ""Go Home Nazis,"" ""Quit Your Job,"" and ""Justice Now!"" as Border Patrol officers pushed them back from the gate and fired smoke grenades.

""We should be horrified,"" protester Shanta Hejmadi said. ""We should be saddened that our government is waging war on our citizens. We should get out and say no. What else can we do?""

WATCH: Minneapolis police chief urges 'lawful, peaceful' response to ICE shooting

Bystanders captured video of Macklin Good's killing in a residential neighborhood south of downtown, and hundreds of people turned up for a Wednesday night vigil to mourn her and urge the public to resist the immigration crackdown. Some then chanted as they marched through the city, but there was no violence.

""I would love for ICE to leave our city and for more community members to come to see it happens,"" said Sander Kolodziej, a painter who came to the vigil to support the community.

The videos of the shooting show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.

In another recording made afterward, a woman who identifies Macklin Good as her spouse is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who is not identified, says the couple recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Noem called the incident an ""act of domestic terrorism"" against ICE officers, saying the driver ""attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.""

President Donald Trump made similar accusations on social media and defended ICE's work.

Noem alleged that the woman was part of a ""mob of agitators"" and said the officer followed his training. She said the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem's version of events ""garbage.""

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" Frey said. ""Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t.""

He also criticized the federal deployment and said the agents should leave.

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. Wednesday's is at least the fifth death linked to the crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced the operation's launch Tuesday, at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A crowd of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting to vent their anger at local and federal officers.

In a scene that hearkened back to crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago, people chanted ""ICE out of Minnesota"" and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He expressed outrage over the shooting but called on people to keep protests peaceful.

""They want a show,"" Walz said. ""We can't give it to them.""

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot Macklin Good.

Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy.","Five Senate Republicans broke with party leaders on Thursday to advance legislation that would rein in President Trump’s use of the U.S. military in Venezuela, a move that comes as a growing number of GOP lawmakers have expressed unease about the White House’s threats to use force to acquire Greenland.

The procedural vote, which came over the objections of Republican leaders, now sets the stage for a full Senate vote next week on a measure that would block Trump from using military force “within or against Venezuela” without approval from Congress. Even with the Senate’s approval, the legislation is unlikely to become law as it is unlikely to pass the House, and President Trump — who has veto power over legislation — has publicly condemned the measure and the Republicans who supported it.

“This vote greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security, impeding the President’s Authority as Commander in Chief,” Trump wrote in a social media post shortly after the 52-47 vote in the Senate.

The Republican defection on the issue underscores the growing concern among GOP lawmakers over the Trump administration’s foreign policy ambitions and highlights the bipartisan concern that the president is testing the limits of executive war powers — not only in Venezuela but also in Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.), one of the Republicans who voted for the resolution, said that while she supported the operation that led to the capture and extradition of Nicolás Maduro, she did not “support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization.”

The resolution is co-sponsored by Sens. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). The Republicans who supported it were Sens. Collins, Paul, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri.

“Finally, the Senate is exercising its constitutional power over the authorization of the use of force to prevent America from being dragged into a new war over oil,” Schiff said in a social media post after the vote.

Vice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House on Thursday that he was not concerned about Trump losing support among Republican lawmakers in Washington, adding that passage of the resolution in the Senate would not “change anything about how we conduct foreign policy over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of months.”

But Republican support for the resolution reflects a deepening concern within the GOP over Trump’s foreign policy plans, particularly his threats to acquire Greenland — a move that prompted European leaders earlier this week to call on the United States to respect the Arctic territory’s sovereignty

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters on Wednesday that he does not believe “anybody’s seriously considering” using the military to take control of Greenland.

“In Congress, we’re certainly not,” Johnson said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) struck a similar tone the same day, telling reporters that he does not “see military action being an option” in Greenland.

Other Republican lawmakers have been more openly critical, warning that even floating the idea of using force against a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance that includes the United States, risks weakening America’s position on the world stage.

“Threats and intimidation by U.S. officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,” Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement. “And the use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America’s most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.”

In a statement Tuesday, the White House said acquiring Greenland was a “national security priority” and that using the military to achieve that goal was “always an option.” A day earlier, Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, told CNN that “Greenland should be part of the United States.”

“Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said.

Miller’s remarks angered Republican senators, including Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) who in an interview with CNN on Wednesday called the idea of invading Greenland “weapons-grade stupid.”

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C), who has served as the top Republicans on the Senate NATO Observer Group since 2018, criticized the idea as well in a searing Senate floor speech.

“I’m sick of stupid,” Tillis said. “I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy. And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”

Tillis, who is not seeking reelection this year, later told CNN that Miller needs to “get into a lane where he knows what he’s talking about or get out of this job.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c36cae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4777x2508+0+339/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F04%2Ff8335cb745a0b79a68096e5e7c83%2F2240791863.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:58:59.220860

Competing narratives quickly emerge

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, ""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. ""

""This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,"" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was angered by the killing, which he linked to President Trump's policy of sending ICE and other federal agents surging into cities such as Minneapolis.

""What we're seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict,"" Walz said on Wednesday. ""It's governing by reality TV and today that recklessness cost someone their life.""

Noem said on Wednesday that she had spoken with Walz about the killing, but added that they don't agree on whether it was justified: ""We have two very different viewpoints on what happened.""

Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.

""It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,"" she said, as NPR reported. ""Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.""

When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released ""and is spending time with his family now.""

Noem also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.

""We've got thousands of officers there,"" she said, ""and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.""

Key details of a controversial shooting

Here is a brief overview of what we know so far about the events leading to Good's death:

When: Police officers responded to reports of shots fired just after 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a timeline published by the city of Minneapolis.

""Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond,"" the city's account states. ""She was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she later died.""

Where: Good was shot in her car on Portland Avenue, near East 34th Street, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.

ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Noem said on Wednesday. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters, a witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR.

How: Callenson, who recorded a video of the incident, told MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders: One agent told her to drive away while another told her to get out of her SUV, Callenson said.

(Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)

Video footage from the scene shows Good's Honda Pilot SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. Two uniformed officers approach the vehicle from the left. As one officer grabs at her door handle, a third officer who had circled to the front of the SUV from the opposite side draws his gun. As Good begins to drive away, the officer fires into her car.

""The preliminary information that we have indicates that this woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference Wednesday. ""At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.""

What's next: On Wednesday, O'Hara said the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.

But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it ""has reluctantly withdrawn"" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.

Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, said that he believes the FBI should not be involved in the inquiry.

""I know that ICE and FBI are different agencies,"" Ellison said, ""but I think in order for public confidence to be at its best, there is some legitimate question as to what the role the FBI should be playing.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7496x4217+0+392/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2F32%2Fe7da77dd416f8d0822d45e65a75f%2Fgettyimages-2254640480.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:59:43.877617

Why it matters: Locals said they worry tensions between Massachusetts officials who back immigrant protections and federal enforcement agencies could lead to more ICE presence in metro Boston or a similar deadly incident.

The latest: The Trump administration intensified its legal battle against Boston's sanctuary policies this week, filing court documents arguing the city actively obstructs federal enforcement.

Zoom in: Justice Department lawyers submitted a 28-page motion Tuesday opposing Boston's attempt to dismiss a federal lawsuit challenging the city's sanctuary policies.

Federal prosecutors claim the sanctuary law enables deportable individuals to evade apprehension.

Trump's DOJ characterized Boston's stance as ""obstructionist"" discrimination against federal immigration enforcement.

Similar federal litigation is underway against multiple sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide

Yes, but: Boston Mayor Michelle Wu defends the Trust Act as crucial to the city's public safety strategy, claiming it contributes to the city's status as the nation's safest major municipality.

The filing is the latest example of rising tensions between local officials and federal authorities.

State of play: Protesters gathered on Boston Common to condemn the Minneapolis shooting and demand federal accountability, while Worcester activists held a rally outside City Hall on Thursday.

The big picture: Weekly demonstrations are already happening at Burlington's ICE field office, with hundreds participating in resistance efforts that show no sign of dissipating.

Wu has said residents felt ""terrified"" by ICE's tactics, a remark that prompted direct pushback from federal officials.

Between the lines: Local immigrant rights organizations are framing the Minneapolis shooting as validation of their warnings about aggressive enforcement.

They're pushing lawmakers to enshrine expanded sanctuary protections into law.

What they're saying: ""There is simply no reason for ICE agents to be on the streets of our communities doing the job of local law enforcement or deploying militaristic tactics which only make America less safe,"" Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition executive director Elizabeth Sweet said in a statement.

The death of Renee Nicole Good, 37, prompted furious demonstrations, and protesters were met with tear gas at a federal building Thursday morning. Documents obtained by The New York Times suggested that at least 100 more federal agents were being deployed to Minnesota.

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis said in an interview on Thursday that the Trump administration would use any chaos as an opportunity to “occupy Minneapolis in some form.”

“Our community members are not taking the bait,” he said.

Officials have described the killing of Ms. Good in starkly different terms. She was killed on Wednesday during a protest on a residential street as federal agents ordered her to move her vehicle.

Administration officials, including President Trump, defended the shooting as lawful, saying that the agent who fired was acting in self-defense. City and state officials described those accounts as “propaganda” and “garbage.”

A video analysis shows that the woman’s vehicle appeared to be turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

State officials initially said they would investigate the killing. But Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said on Thursday that the agency had withdrawn because it had been denied access to evidence.

Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference on Thursday that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation.”

At a news conference in New York City on Thursday, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said that Minnesota and Minneapolis officials had failed to maintain order.

“They have not been cut out,” Ms. Noem told a reporter who had asked about state investigators. “They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”

Cindy Burnham, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. office in the Minneapolis area, declined to comment.

At a White House press briefing, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on claims about the shooting, calling news reporters “agents of propaganda of a radical fringe” for reports indicating that Ms. Good never put the ICE agent in danger before she was shot.

And on social media, Attorney General Pam Bondi warned protesters in Minnesota not to cross a “red line” into obstructing, impeding or attacking federal law enforcement.

Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement action in Minneapolis have occurred for weeks, but Ms. Good’s killing ratcheted up the tension. Demonstrators gathered Thursday at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building just outside the city, the home of local ICE headquarters. By 9 a.m., federal agents had pushed protesters across the street after deploying tear gas.

The building also houses an immigration court, which was closed on Thursday. Public schools were also closed across the city, and will remain so on Friday, because of “safety concerns” related to “incidents around the city,” school officials said in a statement.

Many local and state leaders had been warning for weeks that the surge of immigration enforcement work was bound to stoke chaos. Mr. Walz put the blame squarely on Mr. Trump and Ms. Noem, asking them to pull back federal agents and declaring at a Wednesday news conference, “You’ve done enough.”

Now, more federal agents are on the way. The additional 100 federal agents the Trump administration plans to deploy are Customs and Border Protection officials who will travel to Minnesota from Chicago and New Orleans.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to pause operations in Chicago to support the operation in Minnesota.

The deployment of additional Border Patrol agents is expected to last through the weekend, with a planned return to their cities on Sunday. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the plans.

Tensions between federal and state officials have been exacerbated by a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the Minneapolis area. The president has unleashed xenophobic tirades and made repeated, derisive comments about members of Minnesota’s large Somali diaspora, whose members make up a majority of the fraud defendants.

The shooting on Wednesday happened on Portland Avenue, less than a mile away from the spot where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020, prompting angry protests and tearful vigils late into the night.

Mr. Frey said on Thursday that there were no major public safety incidents in Minneapolis overnight, and that local officials were still monitoring demonstrations.

The city’s priorities, he said, were “keeping people safe” and then “getting ICE out of here.”

Now, Walz slammed what the state claims is the federal government’s decision to exclude a Minnesota agency from its investigation.","The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it was ramping up its investigations in Minneapolis.

In an X post, DHS shared a video showing several law enforcement officers entering a building.

“DHS investigations in Minneapolis are accelerating as more of our brave law enforcement enter the state,” the agency said in the post. “We will not be impeded from ending the FRAUD that has ABUSED our nation’s generosity. See you on the streets!”

Context: Earlier this week, DHS said its agents were in Minnesota conducting a large scale investigation on fraud allegations at day care centers and other places.

It is “very disappointing” to see the vice president “rush out to these conclusions” amid the investigation into what happened in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement shooting of a woman in Minneapolis, former ICE acting director John Sandweg said.

“It makes it incredibly hard for me to understand how anyone is going to see the results of that investigation as credible,” Sandweg told CNN’s Brianna Keilar.

He said the “proper protocol” in this incident is to conduct the investigation as required by the Department of Homeland Security and for “department leadership to refrain from making any judgment until that investigation is complete.”

“It’s important for the credibility of the agency, which is so critical for the agency’s ability to operate,” Sandweg added.

Renee Good’s southside Minneapolis home still has holiday decorations up on the front porch and in the window.

A neighbor said Good had a “really sweet family” and had moved to the neighborhood “relatively” recently.

A few houses down, another neighbor, Clark Hoelscher said they would see Good and her family in the neighborhood from time to time, and “her kids’ sidewalk drawings during the summer.”

“I’m a parent … I can’t imagine, that they came home and their mom isn’t gonna be there anymore,” Hoelscher said.

Another community member who lived nearby stood in front of Good’s house much of the day, greeting anyone who attempted to knock on the door and relaying Good’s family would release a statement at the appropriate time.

“She (Good) was a very welcomed member of the community,” said Kimmy Hull.

Hull isn’t surprised organizing efforts are quickly growing.

“What happened with [George] Floyd, there’s a lot of hard things that came out of it. But there’s a lot of really good things. One of the best things was it taught a lot of people how to work together. How to come together,” Hull said.

Good’s home is less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed, now known as George Floyd Square.

Less than 24 hours after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer, the Latino community in the Twin Cities was feeling tension and concern today.

Abner Castillo, a 51-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant in Minneapolis, said he has carried his passport with him ever since President Donald Trump came into office and still worries about being accused of the passport being fraudulent.

Damian Plaza’s mother immigrated to the United States to give him a better life. Plaza said his cousins cannot attend school and his uncle does not want to go to work.

Those concerns were echoed by Ricardo Lezama, another resident of Minneapolis: “I don’t think anyone should lose their life over this. All of this is very crazy, and I hope everything changes soon.”

Bella Pesantez said she has lived in Minneapolis for several years “and until yesterday I thought everything was peaceful and calm.” Now, after this shooting, she feels unsafe.

The city of Minneapolis said it was concerned over the state’s claim that the federal government blocked a Minnesota agency from a joint investigation into Wednesday’s fatal shooting of Renee Good.

“The decision to remove the (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) from the ICE shooting investigation is deeply disappointing. We are concerned that the investigation is proceeding without state partners, and we are calling for a clear and transparent process that includes state investigating agencies,” the city government said in a post on X Thursday.

The state BCA “reluctantly” withdrew from investigating the shooting after the FBI told the agency the US Attorney’s Office “had reversed course” and would no longer allow the BCA “access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans had said in a statement Thursday.

In a news conference Thursday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Minnesota “must be part of this investigation.”

“I will continue to press that we be part of the investigation, that we do the investigation, so that Minnesotans can trust what the outcome is,” Walz said.

Vice President JD Vance said that the ICE officer who fatally shot a woman in Minnesota on Wednesday was previously hit by a car and received over 30 stitches in his leg.

“Look, in the past six months, he has been hit twice by a motor vehicle. One time, the first time, it led to over 30 stitches and very serious injuries to his legs. This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America. He’s been assaulted, he’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it. He deserves a debt of gratitude,” Vance said.

CNN has previously reported that the officer who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good has 10 years of experience with Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s enforcement and removal operations, according to a senior Homeland Security Official.

Enforcement and Removal Operations is the branch of ICE that deals specifically with the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants. Of that branch, the officer was part of the special response team, the Homeland Security Official said.

CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.

For years, religious leaders have called for the renaming of a federal building in the Minneapolis area that has been the site of protests and clashes with federal agents. They say what happens inside the building goes against the beliefs of the man it was named after.

The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building was named after Minnesota’s first Protestant Episcopal bishop, Henry B. Whipple, who was an advocate for Indigenous people in the 1860s. He was known for his missionary work among the Dakota and Ojibwe people.

In 2019, the Episcopal Church in Minnesota and other religious organizations in the state called for the removal of Whipple’s name from the building.

“The current practices and actions within the Bishop Henry Whipple building are oppositional to the belief, policy, values, practices, and theology of the Episcopal Church,” they said in a news release.

“The fact that the building carries the name of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota’s patriarch, and icon of human rights, is an affront to our church,” they added.

CNN has reached out to the Episcopal Church of Minnesota for comment.

The federal building houses the Fort Snelling Immigration Court in addition to offices for several federal agencies like the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.

Minneapolis City Council Member Aurin Chowdhury cast doubt on the ongoing investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good in her city after state officials said they were forced off the case.

“We are worried about the transparency and fairness of what comes out of this investigation,” she told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Thursday.

Chowdhury, who represents southeast Minneapolis, said local officials have little power to force federal immigration officers to leave the city, but she’ll continue to speak out against their deployment.

She discouraged local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents, which could destroy the trust built in the community, after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

“If MPD was doing the work of the federal government, that trust would be totally broken. We need MPD to work to protect and ensure the safety of our residents here,” said Chowdhury.

Vice President JD Vance on Thursday cast what happened in Minnesota as “an attack on federal law enforcement.”

“This was an attack on law and order. This was an attack on the American people,” he said from the White House podium, adding that he views media coverage of the shooting as “an absolute disgrace.”

Vance, at points, appeared to be shouting from the podium and argued heightened rhetoric surrounding the shooting “puts our law enforcement officers at risk every single day.”

He also claimed that the victim “was there to interfere with a legitimate law enforcement operation in the United States of America.”

Vance want on to claim that she was “part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to dox, to assault, and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job,” without providing any evidence for his claims.

His comments come as federal and local investigations into the incident are just beginning.

And he fiercely defended the ICE agent. “The president stands with ICE. I stand with ICE. We stand with all of our law enforcement officers,” Vance said.

Vice President JD Vance called yesterday’s fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minnesota “a tragedy of the making of the far left.”

“Nobody wants an American citizen to be killed. This is absolutely a tragedy. But it’s a tragedy of the making of the far left. They have radicalized a very small segment of the population, taught them that ICE agents are engaging in an wide-scale violation of people’s rights,” the vice president said.

Pressed further by reporters on who he thought was behind what he described as a “broader left-wing network,” Vance said that it was “one of the things we’re going to have to figure out.”

“You see friends of this woman’s or other people who are eyewitnesses saying basically that she was there to engage in obstruction of a legitimate law enforcement operation. How did she get there? How did she learn about this? There’s an entire network,” the vice president added.

Vance also said Good had to have been “a little brainwashed” and claimed without evidence that she had to also have been “radicalized.”

“I think she is a victim of left wing ideology. What young mother shows up and decides they’re going to throw their car in front of ICE officers who are enforcing legitimate law. You’ve got to be a little brainwashed to get to that point, to where you’re willing not just to protest. That’s fine. Not peacefully protest, but throw your vehicle in front of legitimate law enforcement officers and drive your car into them,” the vice president said.

“To get to that point, you have to be, I think, radicalized in a very, very sad way,” Vance said.

This post has been updated to include an additional quote from Vance.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said federal agents have caused more harm than good in his state.

“We believe that the situation has gotten worse and less safe because of their presence,” Walz said at a news conference Thursday.

“There were two incidents yesterday … that just tore at my soul. I saw an individual at the scene identify themselves as medical personnel, a physician, and asked to provide aid, and an ICE agent said, ‘I do not care,’” Walz said.

“That lack of humanity was chilling to me,” Walz said. “And after this incident happened, and after the tensions rose, ICE agents entered a Minnesota school, causing disruptions at that school.”

Walz, a former teacher, said ICE agents should stay out of children’s schools.

“I can’t say this strongly enough as governor, as a parent, as a teacher, to our elected representatives, Democrats and Republicans: I beg you, I implore you, to tell them to stay out of our schools.”

Some parents in Minneapolis are searching for ways to speak to their children about the fatal shooting of a community member by an ICE agent. Sam Clingan, the father of a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, says he is trying to approach the conversations with honesty.

“We don’t hide the truth of the world from them,” Clingan told CNN today as he visited a memorial at the scene of the shooting.

As a parent, he said he and his wife try to be prepared for unexpected moments when difficult questions arise, like in the car or at the dinner table. Kids process information in their own way, he said.

The couple has tried to explain to their 5-year-old why federal agents are in their community, and what the sound of whistles — used by some residents to warn of agents’ presence — might mean. It’s become a familiar practice for them in a city stricken by other difficult events, like the murder of George Floyd.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t a new practice for us, having tough conversations about things that have happened in our city,” he said.

Protesters barricaded a section of Portland Avenue where the shooting took place using a makeshift wall of trash bins, plywood, construction barricades and wood pallets this morning.

The blocking of the busy road between East 33rd and 34th Streets frustrated some motorist and caused them to be redirected.

“Y’all are disrupting the public!” a frustrated driver yelled out his window while being diverted. “Y’all are the problem!”

Within the barriers, protesters gathered round a fire in a metal trash can at one end and a portable firepit on the other. In between was the shrine to Renee Good, the woman killed in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent yesterday.

There is a mound of colorful bouquets of flowers near the streetlight where Good’s SUV crashed after she was shot.

“I honestly felt useless just staying home, so I thought the next best thing I could do is at least come show my compassion and frustration and sadness,” Caliey Warren said. She held a sign that said “Chinga la Migra,” Spanish for “F**k the immigration authorities.”

Michael McDowell, a longtime activist in Minneapolis, who lives near the area, said he arrived on the scene shortly after Good was shot and was pepper sprayed by ICE agents yesterday.

He said he would like to see people organize a large-scale work strike to protest ICE’s actions.

“Everybody not showing up to work in support of all our immigrant and Latino, Muslim brothers,” would send a message that it’s not okay and “we don’t want ICE here,” McDowell said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a news conference on Thursday that George Floyd’s 2020 murder “tore at the soul of who we were,” but the community healed. Walz said police also built back the trust of the community.

Minneapolis Police “Chief Brian O’Hara came in and took one of the most difficult jobs in America of building back trust in the police force in Minneapolis after Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd,” Walz said. “And he’s earned that, and he’s level and he’s fair, and he’s asking for that.”

“And so Minnesotans, I will continue to press that we be part of the investigation, that we do the investigation, so that Minnesotans can trust what the outcome is,” Walz said during the news conference, which his office said was a public safety update following Wednesday’s shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a federal ICE agent.

Acknowledging that some Minnesotans may be feeling scared, angry or hopeless in this moment, Gov. Tim Walz said all eyes are on the state to keep fighting for democracy.

Protesters have been gathering today in the Minneapolis area after a woman was shot by an ICE agent there yesterday. Now, Walz slammed what the state claims is the federal government’s decision to exclude a Minnesota agency from its investigation.

“It feels to me like we’re at one of those inflection points. That simply asking our government to give us accountability, listen to local leaders, ratchet down the rhetoric, let people feel safe in their person, and let’s let our kids go to school without fear,” the governor said, calling for people to look out for one another.

For the state of Minnesota to be able to file charges, Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson said, the state would need a full investigation.

That invesigation, he said, would need to include “the opportunity to have been at the crime scene, to have had the opportunity to take a look at all the video and evidence that the FBI would have in their possession.”

As a public safety professional, Jacobson – who oversees the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) – said he would not jump to any conclusions about who was at fault.

“What I will say, though, is that unless we do that thorough investigation, unless we have access to all of that evidence, unless we have access to the agents that were involved in that, any witnesses - without any of that, we would not be able to put together a quality investigation for any prosecutor to be able to make a determination as to whether or not someone should be charged with a crime.”

Earlier on Thursday, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it “reluctantly” withdrew from investigating the fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis after the FBI told the agency the US Attorney’s Office “had reversed course” and would no longer allow the BCA “access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews,” BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26007667457388.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-08 14:58:34.667437

It's arguably also the biggest flashpoint yet as Donald Trump's second administration has called on ICE and other agencies to pursue an aggressive deportation strategy.

Here's a look at the history of ICE and some of the major developments and controversies surrounding the agency in the first year of Trump's second term.

ICE expansion over 20 years

ICE came into being after the Homeland Security Act was enacted in 2002, as the United States sought to grapple with the consequences of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Individuals from four countries arrived in the U.S. beginning in 2000 and prepared and trained for the plane hijackings on 9/11.

Responsibilities and functions previously carried out by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) workforce under the aegis of the Department of Labour were reconsidered, and ICE was established in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security, focusing on the removal of unauthorized persons in the U.S. and stamping out cross-border trafficking of migrants.

The U.S. then and now has a significant number of unauthorized persons within its borders — the total is currently estimated at around 12 million by various immigration think-tanks. While president Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to a few million undocumented immigrants in 1986, that kind of measure has not occurred since.

Both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations have utilized ICE — Barack Obama was dubbed by some critics ""the deporter-in-chief."" But from the very first moments of launching his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has focused on illegal immigration in an unprecedented way.

Speaking to CBC's Front Burner podcast in 2025, U.S. historian Adam Goodman said that over the years, ""we've seen a real shift from the service side of the immigration bureaucracy to the enforcement side of immigration bureaucracy.""

In his first administration, Trump sought through executive orders and his own pulpit to pressure some local and state law enforcement agencies who over the years began to limit their co-operation with ICE in some circumstances.

Since capping his political comeback last year, Trump and some of his closest advisers — including Stephen Miller — have expressed a desire for one million deportations a year.

The first-year Trump budget allocated more than $170 billion US over four years for border and interior enforcement, with $75 billion going to ICE for further arrests of immigrants, including the building of more detention facilities. In an analysis critical of the administration, the liberal Brennan Center for Justice said the ICE budget for 2025, at almost $29 billion, was nearly triple the amount of the previous year's budget.

ICE tactics and arrests

A lot of attention has been focused in the past year on ICE agents wearing masks and not identifying themselves.

Todd Lyons, who has been acting ICE director since last March and is still yet to be confirmed by the Senate, has said in multiple interviews it may sometimes occur to prevent the doxxing of officers.

""I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool [for] the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their families safe, then I'll allow it,"" he told CBS's Face the Nation in July.

More seriously, ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents have in some incidents employed chemical agents and flash bangs. In a raid on a Chicago apartment building targeting gang members, agents rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter.

Lyons has said ICE is focused on detaining the worst offenders for eventual deportation, but that anyone who is in the U.S. without authorization is subject to arrest, given the administration's priorities.

Mike Fox, a legal fellow with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank in Washington, criticized that approach in September in an interview with CBC News.

""The [deportation] numbers are going to be a lot lower if you're actually focusing on the violent people that you should be focusing on,"" he said. ""It's a lot easier to just stand outside a Home Depot and round people up.""

Cato has been among a number of think-tanks and civil rights groups to point out that the statistics provided by the federal government have shown that significant numbers of people detained by ICE have not incurred a criminal record since entering the U.S.

Lyons has pointed out that data doesn't take into account criminal records in countries of origin.

Dozens of Canadian citizens are among those who have been detained. Given the administration's goals, it's an unsurprising development — in terms of visa overstays in the U.S., Canadians have perennially ranked high on the list.

The courts have not significantly hindered the way ICE goes about its business, with progressive organizations and some Democrats panning what they now call ""Kavanaugh stops,"" since a controversial Supreme Court order in September.

""To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a 'relevant factor' when considered with other salient factors,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote.

Shootings, but not indictments

Good's killing was the second fatal shooting by an ICE officer in four months. Good, a U.S. citizen, was not the target of any immigration enforcement and it's not clear what agents were doing in the Minneapolis neighbourhood.

ICE agents fatally shot Silverio Villegas González, a 38-year-old cook from Mexico, during a traffic stop in suburban Chicago on Sept. 12. The FBI and DHS have yet to release any information concerning previously announced inquiries into the shooting.

Three other people in the past eight months — two in California and one in Virginia — have died as a result of accidents while running from ICE raids.

Meanwhile, a gunman who opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas last year killed a detainee instead of federal agents he was allegedly targeting. There were also non-fatal shooting incidents in Texas last summer near an immigration centre and a U.S. Border Patrol facility.

ICE-involved shootings before this year were rare but not unprecedented, according to The Trace, an outlet devoted to gun-related news. What is unheard of are prosecutions.

Obtaining court records from a lawsuit filed by a shooting victim, The Trace said they revealed that between 2015 and 2021, 59 shootings by ICE officers occurred across 26 U.S. states, leading to 23 fatalities.

""There's no evidence any ICE agent was indicted,"" The Trace reported.

According to a Reuters legal analysis, federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution if conducting their official duties. At the federal level, a prosecution would have to deal with the challenge of proving the officer didn't believe they were potentially facing the prospect of death or serious injury.

In terms of civil litigation, ICE agents, like police officers, are entitled to qualified immunity for on-the-job shootings, though some Democrats would like to change that.

It is also worth considering that Trump has made liberal use of his power to pardon or issue commutations to individuals accused or convicted of crimes. In his decade as a politician, Trump has, with the exception of the 2021 Capitol riot, supported aggressive law enforcement tactics.

While Trump's border czar Tom Homan said in a CBS interview on Wednesday that he wanted the investigation into Good's death to ""play out"" before making conclusive statements, the president himself and other officials have quickly sought to push a narrative that absolved the unidentified officer and questioned the victim's actions leading up to the shooting.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday that the shooting was in response to ""an act of domestic terrorism.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/fba165ac-7f1c-4cee-847e-ac1d20c32c59,1767893749278/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C857%2C8231%2C4629%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-08 16:59:17.365529

NEW YORK — After a Minneapolis resident was horrifically shot and killed by a federal agent on Wednesday, and the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants, a broad coalition of New York State elected officials, legal service providers, advocates, and impacted families urged immediate and decisive state action today to protect due process through the Campaign for Access, Representation, and Equity (CARE) for Immigrant Families.

The campaign is calling for $175 million in FY27 to fund sustainable, statewide immigration legal services, along with passage of the Access to Representation Act (ARA) and the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act (BUILD), to safeguard New York from federal overreach that threatens to tear families apart and destabilize communities.

The coalition of more than 100 organizations—including the Vera Institute of Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, Immigrant Advocates Response Collaborative (Immigrant ARC), New York Civil Liberties Union, Neighbors Link, and Immigrant Children Advocates’ Relief Effort—highlighted the dramatic escalation in federal enforcement, record number of people in detention, and evisceration of due process rights.

The administration’s unprecedented $170 billion enforcement budget enables mass detention, sweeping raids, and the deployment of federal troops—creating unparalleled threats to New York’s immigrant communities. Nearly 12,800 people have been detained in New York through mid-October—more than double the number of people as the same period a year prior.

As of November, pending cases before New York State immigration courts have reached 327,000, and nearly 30 percent of those facing deportation lack legal representation. This number is even higher for detained people in New York immigration courts, with 40 percent of detained people lacking counsel—a stark indicator of an overwhelmed ecosystem now stretched beyond capacity.

In response to this deepening threat, the CARE campaign has outlined a comprehensive defense strategy, calling for

$175 million in FY27 for immigration legal services. This investment includes $85 million to sustain existing programs, $50 million for new emergency deportation defense, and $40 million to expand capacity-building and infrastructure investments.

Passing the Access to Representation Act (ARA). The ARA (A270/S141) would establish a right to counsel in immigration court, ensuring that anyone facing deportation who cannot afford a lawyer is provided one under a universal representation model.

Passing the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act (BUILD). The BUILD Act (A2689/S4538) would provide funding to strengthen legal services infrastructure through workforce development, rural expansion, and the integration of social workers to coordinate client support.

“While Donald Trump continues to rip apart families and ravage immigrant communities, New York will fight back and defend our neighbors,” said Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris. ""We must immediately take every possible action to establish protections in the law against the inhumane abuses we are witnessing more and more every day.”

“As the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda attacks immigrant New Yorkers, we must defend immigrant communities and meet this moment with action,” said Assemblymember Catalina Cruz. “New York has always been a sanctuary for those seeking safety, opportunity, and justice. But without legal representation, too many of our immigrant neighbors are forced to fight for their futures alone in a system stacked against them. Having a trusted and reputable immigration attorney is more essential than ever for reducing wrongful deportations and being able to understand and defend one’s rights in the immigration system. Our state must invest $175 million in legal services to ensure that no New Yorker is left without a fighting chance. Passing proven and effective legislation like the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act is not just about policy—it’s about standing up for the fundamental right to due process. This is how we push back against the injustice of a federal agenda that separates families, uproots people from their communities, and is against all that New York stands for.”

“As the Trump White House continues to throw billions of taxpayer dollars toward a hostile detention and deportation campaign, law-abiding immigrants are often left to face a chaotic and overwhelmed court system without access to legal counsel,” said State Senator John Liu. “New York needs to fight back by fully funding immigration legal services, establishing a right to counsel, and bolstering workforce development throughout immigration court. The Access to Representation Act and BUILD Act are not only matters of due process but a reflection of our core values of liberty and justice for all. Many thanks to Senator Mike Gianaris, [Assemblymember Catalina] Cruz, and the thousands of advocates across the state who are relentless in the fight to make sure these critical investments are available to help protect immigrant New Yorkers.”

""President Trump’s escalated enforcement and rhetoric over the last year have placed millions of New York families in jeopardy, creating a real risk of mass deportations and separations that is endangering our communities and New York’s future,” said Kelsey Pirnak, advocacy manager for the Vera Institute of Justice’s Advancing Universal Representation Initiative. “New York State leaders face a definitive choice: stand by as neighbors’ lives are upended or take bold, protective action. We must see unwavering investment in legal defense. That means fully funding immigration legal services at $175 million and passing the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act—essential measures to ensure every person who needs legal representation in immigration court in New York receives it.”

“Legal representation can determine whether or not immigrant families are separated, lives are uprooted, or a loved one is deported to a country where their life is at risk,” said Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “As federal immigration authorities aggressively ramp up arrests to meet cruel immigration quotas, New York lawmakers must step up and pass the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act to ensure legal funding is guaranteed for immigrants who need it. Access to a lawyer shouldn’t be incumbent on how much money someone has in their pocket.”

“Immigrant New Yorkers face unprecedented threats to their safety, the well-being of their families, and their ability to stay in their communities. Each day brings escalating violence, more neighbors being abducted and further erosion of due process, as the federal government advances its inhumane and arbitrary deportation agenda,” said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Access to legal counsel in immigration court is the difference between family unity and family separation. We call on our lawmakers to ensure that all New Yorkers in immigration court have equitable access to legal services if they cannot afford it. By making an investment of $175 million in immigration legal services and critical deportation defense work, as well as passing the Access to Representation and BUILD Acts, New York can guarantee no immigrant New Yorker faces immigration court without life-saving representation.”

“The Trump administration is pushing the immigration system to the brink through deliberate cruelty,” said Ellen Pachnanda, CEO of Immigrant ARC. “With the system stacked against them, families and communities pay the price. Without state investment, federal authorities will continue to swiftly deport individuals, tearing families apart. The government shows up with lawyers; families show up alone—setting them up for failure. Fully funding immigration legal services—and passing the Access to Representation Act and BUILD Act—is how New York makes it clear: due process is not optional and justice cannot be selective.”

“Right now, children are being moved through an immigration system that was never designed for them—expected to appear in court, make life-altering legal decisions, and navigate complex processes without an attorney or a trusted adult in their corner,” said Sierra Kraft, executive director of the Immigrant Children Advocates’ Relief Effort (ICARE) Coalition. “At ICARE, we see every day how harmful that is for young people, particularly those navigating trauma, family separation, and high-stakes legal deadlines at a critical stage in their development. The ARA/BUILD Act is urgently needed because it invests in the systems that allow children and youth to stabilize, remain with family, and move forward with dignity. Access to counsel is what separates a child being processed by an enforcement system from a child being protected within it.”

""As we see immigrants across New York facing a widespread federal deportation and detention agenda, the need for immigration legal services is more critical than ever,"" said Karin Anderson Ponzer, director of legal services at Neighbors Link. ""In New York, we have the opportunity to be a national leader in defending the rights of immigrants. Fully funding immigration legal services at $175 million and passing the Access to Representation Act and BUILD Act is a critical step in protecting the rights of immigrant families so they can stay together, continue to work, go to school, and remain in their communities.”

Background

Currently, people facing deportation are not guaranteed a right to appointed counsel. Instead, many who cannot afford to hire legal representation are forced to defend themselves against a trained government lawyer. Investing in legal defense will promote fairness, family unity, and economic stability in a time when immigrants are at acute risk from federal attacks.

Funding for new and expanded immigration legal services is a proven solution to meet the needs of people seeking stability and a chance to work and support their families, protect New Yorkers at risk of deportation, and put into place long-term infrastructure to equip New York to support communities with life-saving legal services. Passing the Access to Representation Act and the BUILD Act will address the uncertainty surrounding the state budget’s annual funding for immigrant legal services by creating a right to an attorney for any New Yorker facing deportation who cannot afford to hire one on their own.

As the Trump administration escalates sweeping arrests and mass deportations, these measures will protect New Yorkers from aggressive federal actions and will promote economic stability as the state faces labor shortages and declining population growth. Investments in legal services will promote community safety and economic stability across New York by ensuring that more parents remain home with their children, more essential workers remain on the job, and more business owners continue to invest in and support our communities.

About the Campaign for Access, Representation, and Equity (CARE) for Immigrant Families: The Vera Institute of Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, Immigrant ARC, New York Civil Liberties Union, Neighbors Link, and Immigrant Children Advocates’ Relief Effort lead CARE for Immigrant Families, along with a coalition of more than 100 leading organizations, religious groups, labor unions, and elected officials united to call for a $175 million investment in immigration legal services and passage of the Access to Representation Act (ARA) and Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense (BUILD) Act. The ARA (A270/S141) will guarantee access to legal representation for people at risk of deportation in New York. Sponsored by Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Catalina Cruz, the legislation would be the first in the nation to create a statewide right to legal representation for people facing deportation who cannot afford it, whether they have recently arrived in the state or have been New Yorkers for decades. The BUILD Act (A2689/S4538) is a companion bill to the ARA that creates a dedicated four-year fund to strengthen New York’s immigration legal services infrastructure, sponsored by Senator John Liu and Assemblymember Catalina Cruz.

Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Trump administration and U.S. Congress are launching a plan this week to overturn former President Joe Biden's mining ban in northern Minnesota and prevent future administrations from taking similar steps, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.

The move has been in development for much of the past year and involves ​a complex series of legislative steps that will benefit Antofagasta's Twin Metals copper, cobalt and nickel project, one of North America's largest untapped reserves of those critical minerals.

Details of the ‌plan have not previously been reported.

It marks a refocus of sorts by Trump on U.S. domestic mining projects, even as his administration continues to angle for access to minerals in Greenland, Ukraine and elsewhere.

The Minnesota plan is almost certain to further escalate ‌tension over where and how to procure minerals crucial for the electrified economy and national defense. Copper, nickel and cobalt are used to build electric vehicles, AI data centers, wind turbines, weaponry and myriad other devices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD OMISSION

Biden in 2023 blocked mining on 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest for 20 years, citing environmental concerns and a belief that the region's economy would benefit more from recreational activity than mining.

The mining ban was filed in the Federal Register, which tracks actions by the executive branch, but not the Congressional Record, which tracks legislative moves and serves as an official notice to Congress.

Under a 1976 law known as the Federal ⁠Lands Policy and Management Act, a president is required to notify Congress ‌of public land orders that affect more than 5,000 acres.

Because Biden did not file the notice in the Congressional Record, Trump's Interior Department is doing so now with the expectation that it will be rejected by Congress.

The U.S. House of Representatives was informed earlier this week by the Interior Department. The notice was ‍then sent to Vice President JD Vance, who is head of the U.S. Senate, and is under review by the U.S. Senate parliamentarian.

If approved by the parliamentarian, which is expected by Friday, Congress would have 60 days to approve or reject the plan with a simple majority. That vote would not be subject to a filibuster.

Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber, a Republican who represents northern Minnesota, plans by Friday to introduce legislation aiming to reject the mining ban. ​If Congress and Trump approve, which is expected in the Republican-controlled body, a future president could not replicate Biden's ban because of a provision in the 1996 Congressional Review Act.

Save the Boundary Waters, ‌a conservation group, said Stauber was using an unprecedented approach to try to force the mine's approval.

""And for what? To benefit a Chilean mining company that sends its minerals to China, will destroy America's most visited wilderness area and leave the mess up to the American and Minnesotan taxpayers,"" said Ingrid Lyons, the group's executive director.

MINING LEASES COULD BE REISSUED

The complex legislative plan came together after efforts failed to include the measure in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed into law last July, congressional staffers said.

""We have industries here in our country that need these critical minerals. We must never rely on foreign adversaries like China for supply,"" Stauber, who is also chair of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, told Reuters.

The White House was not immediately available to comment.

If the mining ban is lifted, the Trump ⁠administration would then be free to reissue mining leases for Chile-based Antofagasta, which has been trying to develop the ​mine for decades on land controlled by the federal government. The mine would still need to undergo an environmental review and ​obtain permits.

Stauber said he has been told by the Trump administration that it is working on reissuing the leases, but he did not have additional details.

Antofagasta's Twin Metals unit said it expects to get the leases back in the near future and that it is ""very appreciative of Congress for their efforts to overturn an unnecessary ‍and detrimental action that locked out a significant domestic ⁠source of critical minerals.""

The leases themselves have been a political hot potato since first issued in 1966. Former President Barack Obama took steps to block their re-issuance, before Trump renewed them in his first term, only to have Biden cancel them.

No mining has taken place at the site.

TENSIONS BETWEEN MINING, OUTDOOR RECREATION

The underground Twin Metals mine would, if built, be a major U.S. ⁠source of copper, cobalt and nickel. The only existing U.S. nickel mine is set to close later this decade.

The region is visited each year by more than 150,000 outdoor enthusiasts, many of whom have long feared that any mine disaster could ‌pollute rivers and quickly spread through the 1.1 million acres of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and into the Great Lakes.

Antofagasta has long said it would use the ‌most advanced equipment to protect the environment.

The event happened Wednesday evening at the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building in Seattle.

The shooting occurred on Wednesday morning at the corner of 34th and Portland Avenue in Minneapolis.

According to preliminary information, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said, the woman was sitting in her vehicle blocking the roadway when a federal law enforcement officer approached on foot.

When the vehicle began to drive away, at least two shots were fired, and the vehicle crashed on the side of the road.

According to the Department of Homeland Security Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, the woman was shot and killed after she allegedly attempted to run over law enforcement officers.

In a post on X, McLaughlin said ICE officers were “conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.”

“The officer, fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin said, adding that the woman was hit and killed.

In a press conference, Sec. Noem confirmed the officer, who was allegedly hit by the woman's car, has been treated and released from the hospital.

The Trump administration is backing the officer who fatally shot the woman, saying that it was an act of defense. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the officers were carrying out lawful enforcement operations, and that the woman had committed “an act of domestic terrorism” by attempting to run over the officer.

President Donald Trump claimed the woman “viciously ran over the ICE Officer.”

In response, emergency protests have erupted in Minneapolis and are expected to continue through Jan. 11.

The Seattle groups are joining the Legalization 4 All Network in calling for an immediate end to ICE raids and mass deportations.

They are also demanding justice and accountability for the woman who was killed, including the release of the name of the ICE agent involved and the names of all agents participating in such operations.

""What ice is doing is unacceptable its horrible, and it has to stop,” said Robert Engel, a spokesperson for the two organizations.

A few hundred protestors gathered at the demonstration on Wednesday evening by around 6:30 p.m., where megaphones, signs of all sizes, and messages sent a clear message across clearly:

“ICE has gone too far; there’s absolutely no reason for anybody to be murdered by ICE, in Minneapolis today, absolutely no reason,” said Raleigh Watts, a lifelong Seattle resident.

Others contended more aggressively that the shooting must made every citizen angry.

""Americans need to do something about it, or the lies and the bloodshed will continue,” said a protestor named Sam, while holding the end of a large banner that read 'Abolish ICE'.

Others, like Bennett Haselton, from Bellevue, say that the deadly shooting is just another symptom of the larger ongoing campaign by Homeland Security and ICE in President Trump's administration to target immigrant communities.

“It’s ridiculous, it’s racist, it’s xenophobic, it’s fomenting hatred toward specific ethnic groups, as well as fomenting hatred toward undocumented people in particular,” said Haselton.

Towards the end of the demonstration, the large crowd marched up Marion Street, to 4th Avenue, before going north for one block, and then heading back over to the Federal office building.

Seattle Police had an SUV following the group to ensure the march went smoothly.

When geopolitics becomes transactional—trade penalties, arms sales, access games—human rights often get sidelined.","Donald Trump gave us a very clear picture this week of how he wants Americans to think about India—and it’s not “shared democratic values,” “people-to-people ties,” or even “strategic partnership.” It’s dominance.

On January 5, 2026, talking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a good guy,” and then immediately reframed the relationship as something Modi needed to manage around Trump’s personal approval: it was “important to make me happy,” Trump said, because the U.S. can “raise tariffs… very quickly.”

On January 6, 2026, speaking at the House GOP Member Retreat, Trump doubled down on the same story—only more theatrical. He claimed Modi came to him asking, “Sir, may I see you please,” and then added that Modi is “not that happy with me” because India is “paying a lot of tariffs” tied to Russian oil purchases.

We’re not interested in treating this as gossip or “just Trump being Trump.” These comments matter because they show how easily a relationship that affects more than 1.4 billion people can be reduced to a reality-TV power play—tariffs as punishment, flattery as currency, and human rights as the first thing thrown off the boat.

This isn’t only a clash of personalities. It’s a model of politics—strongman competition—that treats trade and migration as weapons and turns diplomacy into humiliation theater. The cost tends to move downward: onto workers, migrants, minorities, and families.

What Trump actually did: turn a complex relationship into a loyalty test

Let’s name the pattern.

Trump isn’t talking about India as a place with workers, farmers, students, journalists, or minorities who deserve protection and dignity. He’s talking about India as a lever in his own performance of power: Who’s in trouble with me? Who’s trying to please me? Who’s paying a price?

In the Air Force One remarks, Trump tied tariffs to India’s oil trade with Russia and framed India’s choices as a response to his displeasure. In the retreat speech, he personalized it further—Modi as the person coming to seek an audience, Modi as the person who must be unhappy now that the tariffs are high.

This isn’t just undignified. It’s dangerous, because it normalizes the idea that international relationships should run on humiliation and coercion rather than law, rights, and accountability.

And it’s not hypothetical. Reuters reported Trump has already doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50% (as punishment connected to Russian oil purchasing), and that analysts describe the tariff structure as including a portion tied specifically to Russian crude. The Indian Express summarized the tariff setup as 50% total, with 25% described as a reciprocal levy and 25% tied to purchases of Russian oil.

When leaders play hardball on TV, real people absorb the consequences—especially workers in export-heavy industries, families facing price shocks, and communities that already live with economic precarity.

Here’s the part diaspora progressives recognize immediately

Trump’s remarks about Modi don’t function as ordinary diplomacy so much as a familiar genre in today’s global politics: strongman competition. It’s a contest over status and dominance—who gets to appear as the decisive “protector,” who sets the terms, who gets framed as conceding ground. The narrative is masculinist and dated, but it has returned to the center of international life with surprising force: policy becomes secondary to performance, and entire populations become props in a story about “great men.”

This dynamic lands in distinct ways across the Indian diaspora—and not only as symbolism. Diaspora communities understand, almost instinctively, that when leaders turn international relations into a dominance ritual, someone else pays: prices shift, contracts get canceled, uncertainty spreads through supply chains, and the costs migrate downward to exporters, workers, and small businesses. In other words, this is not just a clash of egos; it is “punish the economy to punish the government,” and everyone can predict who pays. Not presidents and prime ministers—shop owners, factory workers, farmers tied to exports, and households dealing with higher costs and uncertainty.

Many diaspora progressives will read the spectacle as a kind of exposure—less “justice” than revelation. If Modi’s political brand has been marketed internationally as strength and inevitability, there is a bitter clarity in seeing that brand treated as disposable within Trump’s own hierarchy. It underscores a core problem with strongman politics: the currency is dominance, and dominance always requires a target. When the goal is to appear powerful, there is no stable endpoint—only the next opportunity to demonstrate who can coerce whom, and whose economy can be made to flinch.

For sections of the diaspora that support Modi, Trump’s tone can register as a provocation. The same “strength” aesthetic celebrated in India—often alongside minimization of how that strength is exercised against minorities, dissenters, journalists, and civil society—can feel intolerable when the hierarchy flips internationally and Modi is positioned as the one being spoken down to. That reversal is instructive: it shows how quickly the language of pride and national dignity becomes entwined with a preference for hierarchy, rather than a commitment to rights—and how quickly “strength” talk becomes detached from the real question of who bears its costs.

The broader risk is that this style of politics normalizes a framework where relationships between states are managed through public humiliation, transactional loyalty, and punitive leverage, while human rights are treated as peripheral. Trump can call Modi “a good guy” and still reinforce a corrosive model of governance: personal loyalty over institutions, spectacle over accountability, punishment over persuasion. The effect is not simply rhetorical. It shifts what counts as “success” in foreign policy—from measurable improvements in safety and freedom to the optics of dominance—and that is precisely the terrain on which rights are most easily abandoned, while exporters, workers, and ordinary families are left carrying the bill.

The human rights cost of “transactional friendship”

There’s another reason this moment lands differently from an Indian diasporic perspective: when Washington treats India primarily as (a) a market for weapons or (b) a pawn in great-power competition, human rights become easy to downgrade into “noise.” But the human rights situation is not background noise. Human Rights Watch has warned about the high cost of dissent in India, including the misuse of broad laws that fall heavily on critics and minorities, and Freedom House continues to rate India “Partly Free.” These are mainstream, documented concerns—not niche talking points.

So when Trump turns the U.S.–India relationship into a dominance ritual—tariffs up, tariffs down; access granted, access denied—the conversation that gets crowded out is the one that matters most: Are people safer? Are minorities protected? Can journalists report? Can civil society breathe? And just as crucially: who is being sacrificed so two leaders can look “tough”? In this standoff, the real victims are often Indian families on both sides of the border who placed their faith in these strongman narratives—and are now paying the price.

That’s not “anti-India.” It’s pro-democracy, pro-people, and pro-rights—consistently, not only when it flatters whoever is in power.

About the Russia-oil piece: what’s real, what’s claimed, and what’s at stake

Trump is using India’s purchases of Russian oil as the headline justification for trade punishment.

We can hold two truths at once: Russia’s war economy is propped up in part by energy revenue, and countries’ purchase decisions matter. But we should also be clear that the energy priorities of the world’s most developed nations do not automatically take moral or political precedence over everyone else’s—especially when those same nations have long histories of climate and extraction policies that shifted costs onto the Global South. A rights-based approach has to reckon with uneven development, domestic energy needs, and the real distributional impacts of abrupt price shocks. That’s exactly why tariffs-as-shaming is not a serious human rights policy: when it’s delivered as a personalized punishment ritual, it treats entire populations as collateral while sidestepping the harder work of coordinated, transparent strategies that reduce war financing without reproducing global hierarchies.

Trump claimed India has reduced Russian oil purchases. Separately, Reuters reported that India’s imports of Russian oil may drop sharply in January 2026, after Reliance said it isn’t expecting Russian crude deliveries that month. That’s a concrete development—but it still doesn’t justify turning diplomacy into a public hazing ritual.

We should be skeptical of any approach that uses “humanitarian” or “anti-war” language as cover for ego-driven economic coercion—because the human rights results tend to be accidental, not designed.

Two Leaders And Two Political Machines That Thrive On Spectacle And “Strength”

What all of this reveals is a shared architecture: two leaders and two political machines that thrive on spectacle, hierarchy, and the promise of “strength,” even when the costs are pushed onto ordinary people. Trump’s language turns diplomacy into a dominance ritual; Modi’s brand of authority has long leaned on a similar aesthetic at home. When those logics collide, it doesn’t produce clarity or peace—it produces policy-by-posture: tariff threats that ricochet into prices and jobs, immigration moves that strand families and workers, and a public atmosphere that makes racism feel licensed.

For the Indian diaspora, that’s the hard moral test. We are close enough to feel the consequences and influential enough to shape the narrative. If we accept a world where leaders “win” by humiliating each other, we also accept a world where rights become conditional—for migrants in chains, for workers caught in trade crossfire, for students and journalists facing repression, for minorities made into bargaining chips, and for diaspora communities targeted by hate when politics becomes punishment.

A better U.S.–India relationship—one worthy of the word partnership—would be boring in the right ways: less swagger, more rules; less ego, more institutions; less coercion, more accountability. It would measure success by whether people are safer and freer, not by who looked dominant on camera. And it would insist on the same democratic baseline everywhere: pluralism, civil liberties, and minority rights are not side issues to be traded away for a short-term show of force.

FAQ: Trump Modi Remarks, U.S. Tariffs On India, Russian Oil, H-1B, And Anti-Indian Hate

What Did Trump Say About Modi And India This Week?

Trump framed Modi and India through a dominance lens—presenting U.S.–India relations as something managed through personal approval, public pressure, and consequences. The underlying message wasn’t “partnership,” but leverage: who sets terms, who gets treated as subordinate, and who pays when they don’t comply.

Why Are There U.S. Tariffs On India Right Now?

Trump has linked U.S. tariffs on India to India’s purchases of Russian oil, using tariffs as a pressure tool. Whatever the stated rationale, tariffs are a blunt instrument: they create uncertainty quickly and can trigger cascading effects through trade relationships.

How Do U.S. Tariffs On India Affect Indian Exports And Jobs?

Tariffs raise the cost of Indian goods entering the U.S. market, which can reduce demand, cancel contracts, and squeeze margins. That pressure often moves down the supply chain—impacting exporters, smaller suppliers, and workers before it meaningfully impacts political leaders.

How Could U.S. Tariffs On India Affect Indian Americans And The Indian Diaspora?

Diaspora communities are part of the connective tissue of US–India relations. Trade shocks can hit diaspora-run businesses, import/export networks, and family finances. Just as importantly, tariff showdowns can harden identity politics in diaspora spaces—turning “pride” into a loyalty test and crowding out serious conversations about rights and democratic norms.

Why Is Russian Oil Linked To India Tariffs?

Russia’s war economy benefits from energy revenue, and countries’ energy purchases matter. But using tariffs as public punishment isn’t the same as building effective, equitable policy. A serious approach would include coordinated strategies that reduce war financing while also addressing uneven development, energy constraints, price stability, and transition support—so ordinary people aren’t treated as collateral.

What Does This Mean For US–India Relations Long-Term?

When leaders conduct US–India relations as a dominance contest, institutions and norms weaken. The relationship becomes more volatile—less predictable for businesses and families, and less able to address shared challenges like climate, migration, and regional stability. It also makes it easier for human rights to be treated as “optional” or “inconvenient.”

Why Are Human Rights Groups Mentioned In A Post About Trump Modi Remarks?

Because the stakes aren’t just tone; they’re outcomes. When geopolitics becomes transactional—trade penalties, arms sales, access games—human rights often get sidelined. The questions that should remain central are: Are minorities protected? Can journalists report? Can civil society operate without fear? Is democracy expanding to include more people, not fewer?

What’s Happening With Indian Immigrants And Deportations?

Reports have described Indian undocumented migrants deported under visibly punitive conditions (including shackling), as well as third-country deportation tactics that can leave people effectively restricted or detained far from home. These practices raise basic questions of dignity, due process, and state violence—exactly the issues that get ignored when diplomacy becomes a strongman performance.

How Do H-1B Changes Affect Indian Tech Workers?

Policy shifts and enforcement uncertainty can strand Indian workers on either side of the border—unable to travel without risking status, unable to continue jobs, or trapped in long backlogs that shape life decisions for years. This isn’t just a labor-market story; it’s a family stability and rights story.

Is Anti-Indian Hate Rising—And Why Does This Climate Matter?

When leaders and political ecosystems normalize scapegoating and punishment politics, it can intensify a climate where anti-Indian racism spreads faster—online and offline. Slurs and harassment campaigns aren’t just “internet noise”; they shape what people feel permitted to say and do to Indian and South Asian communities, including migrants and visa workers. It is up to us to refuse loyalty-test politics. Ask who is paying for tariff shocks and immigration punishment. Challenge anti-Indian racism directly. And insist on a consistent democratic baseline: rights aren’t a reward for loyalty; they’re a constraint on power—at home in the diaspora, in Indi and across South Asia — and in the international order.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d45b55d7563de000169a046/66900c4f6a6414762936be39/695fa44eec0d4c7dc98f818b/1767878793178/January+26+EventsHolidays+%281%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-08 16:59:02.970266

Kayla Epstein

The fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis has sparked protests and placed increased scrutiny on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

ICE has made thousands of arrests since Trump returned to the White House, often in public settings.

Those actions have increasingly brought its agents into communities across the country, leading to resistance from some local residents who oppose their operations.

What is ICE and when was it formed?

ICE is taking the lead in carrying out the Trump administration's mass deportation initiative, which was a central promise of Donald Trump's election campaign.

The US president has significantly expanded ICE, its budget and its mission since returning to the White House. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US.

ICE was formed as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, a response to the terror attacks on 11 September 2001. The legislation created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with ICE as one of its subsidiary agencies.

What powers do ICE agents have to arrest people?

ICE sees its mission as encompassing both public safety and national security. However, its powers are different than the average local police department in the US.

Its agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally. They can detain US citizens in limited circumstances, such as if a person interferes with an arrest, assaults an officer, or ICE suspect the person of being in the US illegally.

Despite this, according to news organisation ProPublica, there were more than 170 incidents during the first nine months of Trump's presidency in which federal agents held US citizens against their will.

These cases included Americans they had suspected of being undocumented immigrants.

What powers does ICE have to use force?

ICE's use of force actions are governed by a combination of the US Constitution, US law and the Department of Homeland Security's own policy guidelines.

Under the US constitution, law enforcement ""can only use deadly force if the person poses a serious danger to them or other people, or the person has committed a violent crime"", said Chris Slobogin, director of the criminal justice programme at Vanderbilt University Law School.

But the US Supreme Court has historically granted broad leniency to officers making in-the-moment decisions without the benefit of hindsight.

A DHS policy memo from 2023 states that federal officers ""may use deadly force only when necessary"" when they have ""a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury"" to themself or another person.

Where does ICE operate?

Typically, ICE operates inside the US, with some staffing abroad. It's sister agency, US Customs and Border Protection, technically patrols the US borders.

But those roles have become increasingly blurred, as the Trump administration pulled agents from a range of federal law enforcement agencies to participate in immigration enforcement. Border Patrol officers increasingly operate within the US, taking part in raids with ICE.

ICE and other agencies have deployed hundreds of officers to cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and now Minneapolis, in partnership with other federal law enforcement agencies.

As many as 2,000 federal officers will deploy to Minneapolis as part of the latest operation, the Associated Press reported.

What happens to people who are detained by ICE?

The scale of Trump-era deportations have been significant.

The administration said it had deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had ""voluntarily self-deported"", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention.

An immigrant who encounters ICE can face a variety of outcomes.

Sometimes an individual is temporarily held, then released after questioning. In other circumstances, ICE will detain and transfer that person to a larger detention facility, of which there are several throughout the US.

While many immigrants continue to fight for legal status while detained, if they are unsuccessful, they may ultimately be deported.

About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University.

Immigration lawyers have told the BBC that, once ICE detains an individual, it can sometimes take days for families or lawyers to find out where they are.

What are the criticisms of ICE and what opposition have its agents met?

Many communities have pushed back when ICE and partner agencies like the Border Patrol carry out operations.

It is now common for residents to film ICE agents as they carry out arrests. Some encounters between ICE and the public have become aggressive or violent.

During ICE operations in Chicago, Illinois, a collective of media organisations sued the Border Patrol. They alleged agents used improper force against journalists, religious leaders and protesters. A federal judge sided with the group, before an appeals court overturned the decision.

The Minneapolis shooting is not the first time an individual has been injured by gunfire during an immigration enforcement operation.

There were two incidents in Los Angeles in October in which agents shot at drivers, the Los Angeles Times reported. DHS said in both instances that the drivers had threatened the officers with their vehicles.

ICE officers, and other immigration agents, have been criticised for wearing masks while carrying out their operations. DHS officials have defended the practice, saying it protects agents from doxing or harassment.

Tiffany Wertheimer

The woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.

She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.

But the Trump administration has called her a ""domestic terrorist"".

Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read ""Justice for Renee"".

Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was ""probably terrified"" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was ""one of the kindest people I've ever known"".

""She was extremely compassionate,"" Ganger told the daily newspaper. ""She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.""

Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that ""she had a good life, but a hard life"".

A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $500,000 in 15 hours.

In what appears to be Good's Instagram account, which has now been made private, Good described herself as a ""poet and writer and wife and mom"", who was ""experiencing Minneapolis"".

A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs and had moved to Minneapolis just last year from Kansas City.

The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that she used to host a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the newspaper.

She had two other children with her first husband, who spoke to US media on condition that his name was not used. He said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.

She had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.

Good studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.

""When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,"" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.

Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.

Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was ""yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation"".

""May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,"" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.

Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations.

Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was ""not part of anything"" that involved challenging ICE agents.

But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been ""stalking and impeding their work"" all day by ""blocking them in"" with her car and ""shouting at them"".

Good ""weaponised her vehicle"", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers ""in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism"".

The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and ""fired defensive shots"".

This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that ""the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting"".

He called her a ""professional agitator"" who ""violently, willfully, and viciously"" ran over an ICE officer.

But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.

""Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,"" Jacob Frey said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9bd7/live/0df09270-ec89-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:59:13.260400

The proposed spending bill would provide billions to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds DHS received last summer, including for private prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, we have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, leading to the detention of longtime residents, children, and even U.S. citizens. Passing this bill and giving DHS more money to detain our neighbors is dangerous and may lead to irreversible harm.

Congress reportedly is nearing an agreement to fund DHS for 44,500 immigration detention beds, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to abduct and deport more people at any given day than ever before. This number is up from 41,500 beds appropriated for FY24 and would be layered on top of the beds ICE is already spending on with the unprecedented $45 billion that Congress allocated as part of the 2025 reconciliation bill. This is especially alarming given reports that ICE is planning to erect new warehouse gulags for potentially over 80,000 people at a time. At Fort Bliss, the nation’s largest detention site, we have already seen people exposed to brutal conditions, including sexual abuse, overcrowding, and inadequate food; we expect these warehouses to similarly be sites of humanitarian catastrophe and immense suffering.

ICE is currently detaining a record breaking population of over 68,000 people with deadly consequences – six people died in ICE custody in December 2025 alone, during the deadliest year for people in detention in decades. Further, there is also nothing in this bill that prevents the administration from using this added funding to detain families, including young children, hundreds of whom have been detained for months in facilities without safe drinking water, medical care, education, or access to lawyers. This is a system that needs oversight, not another windfall in funds.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to pause operations in Chicago — where Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official, has led controversial arrest efforts — to support the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota. Border Patrol officials also plan to send all nonlethal weapons housed in Chicago to Minnesota, according to the documents.

The increased presence of Border Patrol agents is expected to last through the weekend, with a planned return to their cities on Sunday. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the plans.

The surge of Border Patrol agents in the Twin Cities comes as local officials have called on immigration officers to leave Minneapolis after the killing of Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday.

Federal officials have said that Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen who lived in Minneapolis, tried to use her vehicle to run over law enforcement officers before she was fatally shot by an ICE officer. State and local officials have disputed federal accounts of the shooting.

Surges of immigration agents have at times staged dramatic raids in recent months in a number of Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Portland and Washington, D.C. The deadly encounter in Minneapolis was at least the ninth shooting by an ICE officer since September. The immigration enforcement actions have prompted backlash and protests in those cities, and federal officials say the heated discourse has led to more threats against ICE agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis suggested that the shooting on Wednesday was the result of reckless actions by an ICE officer. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a Democrat, posted on social media about the administration’s account of events: “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

The Department of Homeland Security said this week that it had ramped up its presence in the region and deployed 2,000 law enforcement officers to the Twin Cities. Despite calls by local officials to leave, homeland security officials have pledged to continue operations in Minnesota.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday that immigration officers briefly paused their work after the shooting but were continuing operations in the region.

“We’re going to keep doing the work,” Mr. Lyons said.

The Trump administration has recently focused on Minnesota after fraud investigations into a Covid-19 program intended to feed children and other safety-net programs that were overseen by the administration of Mr. Walz, who on Monday dropped his bid for re-election.

More than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases. Most of the defendants are of Somali origin. President Trump has used xenophobic language in recent weeks to attack Somalis living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08DC-bp-minn-ltpj/08DC-bp-minn-ltpj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:58:47.090545

DOJ’s failure to act signals a troubling abdication of its authority to enforce the constitutional limits of federal agents’ coercive power.
Select Incidents Meriting Investigation Over the past seven months, many incidents involving federal immigration agents’ force have been documented on video.
Local prosecutors face significant legal hurdles in bringing charges against federal officials for violating state law: where federal agents’ actions are authorized by federal law and “necessary and proper” for fulfilling their federal duties, they may be immune from prosecution under the Supremacy Clause.
Other states and cities have created online portals that residents can use to report misconduct by federal agents.","On Wednesday morning in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed a woman in her car during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials characterized the shooting as a response to “an act of domestic terrorism,” stating the woman “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted to “run over” officers. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has disputed that account, describing the incident as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying.” Governor Tim Walz described it as “totally avoidable.” The FBI and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension initially announced they were jointly investigating the matter. Within hours, the U.S. Attorney’s Office reversed course, stripping the state agency of access to case materials and asserting unilateral control over the investigation.

The fatal Minneapolis shooting is among the most serious in a series of incidents over recent months involving federal immigration agents’ use of force. Videos have documented agents firing pepper balls at clergy, shooting rubber bullets at journalists, and deploying tear gas against protesters. Many of these incidents raise questions about whether agents used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment and federal criminal law. Yet, the Minnesota incident is only the first where the FBI has indicated it is investigating, and so far, DOJ has announced no criminal charges related to any such incident. While the current investigation is an important step, it is far from sufficient.

Private plaintiffs are challenging the legality of many DHS tactics in court. The Department of Justice (DOJ), for its part, has remained conspicuously silent through months of these tactics. This silence is a dangerous abdication of DOJ’s authority and responsibility. Under 18 U.S.C. § 242, which makes it a crime for any government official to willfully deprive someone of their constitutional rights, DOJ can and should investigate and, where appropriate, charge federal agents who use excessive force.

A Pattern of Force Raising Constitutional Questions

Reports of aggressive, violent, and potentially unlawful tactics by some federal agents have followed each surge of officers arriving in a new city to conduct the administration’s immigration enforcement operations. These have included a military-style, nighttime raid on sleeping families at an apartment complex, the firing of tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, and pepper balls at non-violent protestors, and widespread racial profiling followed by stops and detentions without reasonable suspicion or warrants. State and local officials have decried the unreasonable uses of force in court and in public statements, and at least two Senators have publicly called on DOJ to investigate. Nevertheless, the President and Department of Homeland Security leadership have repeatedly defended their tactics.

Traditionally, the DOJ—in any administration—would seek accountability for unlawful, excessively violent tactics by law enforcement officers, by charging them with violating people’s constitutional rights. However, the DOJ has not announced any charges relating to federal immigration enforcement actions, nor (before Wednesday) had it indicated it had even taken notice.

This is not surprising. By now, it is clear to those paying attention that the DOJ is acting as the administration’s enforcer, prioritizing politicized prosecutions against Trump’s perceived enemies, rather than exercising its independent judgment. And while public attention, understandably, has focused on those high-profile questionable prosecutions, DOJ’s omissions—the cases it is choosing not to pursue—also deserve scrutiny. The agency’s silence about violent tactics by federal agents suggests an apparent abandonment of its criminal civil rights enforcement authority, a silence that is destructive to the rule of law itself.

DOJ’s failure to act signals a troubling abdication of its authority to enforce the constitutional limits of federal agents’ coercive power. The federal statute that is most clearly implicated by aggressive ICE and CBP tactics, 18 U.S.C. § 242, is a Reconstruction-era law that makes it a criminal offense for federal, state, or local government officials to willfully deprive a person of their constitutional rights. Congress passed the statute as part of a series of laws intended to protect the rights of Black Americans following the Civil War. The statute was among those aimed at enforcing the protections of the newly enacted Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.

Investigations and prosecutions under Section 242, while not numerous, are often significant. Career prosecutors under both Republican and Democratic administrations have, for decades, relied on the statute to investigate the conduct of law enforcement officers when needed. DOJ used Section 242 to prosecute the men, including law enforcement officials, responsible for the 1964 murder of three young civil rights activists in Mississippi. In 1993, under the leadership of Attorney General Bill Barr, DOJ obtained indictments against four Los Angeles Police Department officers involved in the 1991 beating of Rodney King, two of whom were later convicted at trial. Nearly three decades later, the first Trump Administration’s DOJ, again under Attorney General Bill Barr’s leadership, opened an investigation into the death of George Floyd. The DOJ later charged four Minneapolis Police Department officers with violating Section 242, ultimately convicting them for violating Mr. Floyd’s constitutional rights.

DOJ’s failure to address apparent uses of excessive force by federal immigration agents, coupled with DHS doubling down on the appropriateness of its violent and constitutionally questionable tactics, makes the situation more dangerous. In prior administrations, agents credibly accused of violating the Constitution by using unreasonable force would commonly be placed on leave, or on desk duty, while the agency (in this case, ICE or CBP) conducted an internal administrative investigation or referred the incident to DOJ. DOJ could then conduct a criminal investigation when warranted and, if no charges resulted, the agency could determine whether it needed to take administrative action or return the officer to enforcement duties. Currently, however, DHS has permitted agents to continue to serve, with few known exceptions—and even lauded their conduct. Meanwhile DOJ’s silence emboldens further aggressive uses of force.

Select Incidents Meriting Investigation

Over the past seven months, many incidents involving federal immigration agents’ force have been documented on video. While each incident requires thorough investigation to determine whether agents violated federal law, the publicly available evidence in many cases appears to implicate Section 242 and merit a full investigation. Indeed, at least one federal court has already concluded that individual and organizational plaintiffs made a “strong showing” that the government’s tactics constituted unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

September 19, 2025 – Broadview, Illinois

To take one widely-reported example, on September 19, 2025, at least one federal agent stationed on the roof of an ICE processing and detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, fired pepper balls at Reverend David Black as he prayed outside the building with a group of protestors holding signs, shouting, and dancing. A video shows Reverend Black, dressed in clerical garb and standing with his arms extended, palms open and empty, in a parking space outside the building, when an agent drew and repeatedly fired a pepper ball launcher at Black, striking him in the head, arms, and torso, and causing him to fall to his knees. Black later stated in a court declaration that the officers had issued no warnings or orders to disperse before firing, and none can be heard in the video. Neither Black nor the other protestors visible in the video appeared to pose any threat to the officers.

While a full investigation would be required, the publicly available evidence indicates that one or more officers may have committed a felony civil rights violation in firing pepper balls at Reverend Black. To establish a violation of Section 242, a defendant must have been (1) acting under color of law when he (2) willfully (3) deprived a person of a constitutional or federal right. Officers act “under color of law” when they act in their official capacity. The agent who fired at Reverend Black was acting under color of law, and in firing pepper balls at Reverend Black and other protesters, the officer may have violated both Black’s First and Fourth Amendment rights.

Focusing on Black’s Fourth Amendment right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a law enforcement officer, it is not apparent there was a need for any force—the protestors did not pose a discernable threat to the safety of the officers or anyone else, and the video indicates no urgent need for the protestors to move. Firing pepper balls with no warning at a pastor’s head while he was praying under these circumstances is objectively unreasonable. And the very obvious unreasonableness of those actions indicates that the officer knew firing on Black would be unlawful. Knowing this—and choosing to fire anyway—is the definition of willfulness. Finally, Reverend Black’s reaction—clasping his hand to his eyes and collapsing on his knees—shows that he suffered bodily injury. Proving this element makes the crime a felony. In any previous administration, an incident like this, caught on video, would have prompted an immediate DOJ investigation.

October 23, 2025 – Oakland, California

In Oakland, on October 23, 2025, the Reverend Jorge Bautista attended an early morning vigil to protest an expected immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. As trucks carrying CBP agents drove past protestors toward a bridge connecting Oakland with the agents’ destination, a Coast Guard base, agents exited the trucks and approached the protestors, including Reverend Bautista. One agent trained a pepper ball launcher on Bautista from about five feet away. As Bautista said, “we’re here in peace,” the agent fired a pepper ball into Bautista’s face, leaving him coated in powder and bleeding from his chin. While video and photographs that capture the incident do not show all the circumstances that would be relevant to determining whether this use of force was reasonable, firing at such close range at the head of a pastor who, by his words and actions showed that he did not pose a threat, appears unreasonable; these facts would support an investigation.

June 7, 2025 – Paramount, California

On June 7, 2025, journalist Ryanne Mena was interviewing protestors near a Home Depot in Paramount, California, wearing press credentials, when federal agents exiting a nearby warehouse began firing rubber bullets at her and the protestors. They did so without first issuing a warning. Mena said relatively few protestors were present, and she did not see anyone threatening or antagonizing the agents. As she and a second journalist ran for cover, a rubber bullet struck her in the head; the other journalist was hit in the forehead with a tear gas canister. This incident, too, would be an appropriate subject for a Section 242 investigation.

Proving Section 242 violations beyond a reasonable doubt can be challenging in part because the law permits officers to use force—even lethal force—in certain circumstances. When officers willfully exceed the bounds of the law, however, the DOJ is authorized to prosecute. The DOJ’s prosecution of federal officers who have violated Section 242 involves, at its core, the enforcement of not just a criminal statute but the rule of law itself—as it ensures the officers entrusted to execute the law themselves act within its bounds.

Bringing civil rights prosecutions against law enforcement officers is never easy. Juries tend to be wary of harshly judging those who choose a job protecting the public at risk to their own safety. But DOJ has traditionally recognized the importance of holding the agents and officers who wear badges and carry guns responsible when they willfully violate the rights of those whom they serve. This practice underscores the idea that no one is above the law.

The video evidence and other evidence already in the public domain about these and other incidents provides ample cause to open civil rights investigations. Yet we have heard resounding silence from this DOJ.

Other Avenues for Relief are Challenging

Action from DOJ in response to excessive force by federal immigrant agents is vital also because alternative paths for pursuing accountability are challenging. Local prosecutors face significant legal hurdles in bringing charges against federal officials for violating state law: where federal agents’ actions are authorized by federal law and “necessary and proper” for fulfilling their federal duties, they may be immune from prosecution under the Supremacy Clause. Private litigants also face significant doctrinal challenges when suing federal officers, as the Supreme Court has both limited the availability of injunctive relief for ongoing violations and narrowed the circumstances under which suits for monetary damages may be brought against federal officials. Where litigants can sue, the robust protections provided by qualified immunity often mean the suit is dismissed before discovery—even if a court agrees that the federal officials violated the Constitution.

States, therefore, are pursuing creative methods to document perceived abuses, as Governor Pritzker has done in creating the Illinois Accountability Commission. This Commission aims to gather evidence of potentially unlawful conduct by federal agents, to support referrals to investigative agencies and recommendations for changes to existing laws to better protect state residents. Other states and cities have created online portals that residents can use to report misconduct by federal agents. Still others have announced they are investigating possible violations of state law by federal agents or that they stand ready to do so. Meanwhile, many state and local law enforcement leaders remain focused on improving both public safety and community trust, which go hand-in-hand. Their approaches include better engagement with communities, an emphasis on deescalation, and new guidelines for policing protest events. Where federal officers are not immune from state prosecution (because, for instance, their actions violate federal law) states can select the appropriate charge from an array of state statutes, including ones that, unlike Section 242, permit prosecution for criminal negligence and other lesser levels of intent than Section 242 requires.

The proposed rule would eliminate current (and past) language that states the use of public benefits by family members does not count against green-card applicants.
This regulation extensively detailed which prior public benefits use would count in a public-charge determination.
However, even before its implementation, news of the coming change caused immigrant families to disenroll from public benefits or never sign up.
Effects on Future Immigration The proposed rule’s lack of guidelines for applying a public-charge test could also significantly affect future immigration, depending on how adjudicators exercise their discretion.","The Trump administration is proposing to change how the federal government assesses who should be barred from getting a green card or immigrating to the United States because they are likely to become a “public charge.” This term has been in U.S. immigration law for more than a century and has generally meant someone who is mainly reliant on the government for basic needs.

In a proposed rule issued in November, the administration seeks to remove provisions it says “straight-jacket” officers making public-charge assessments. By rescinding all prior regulatory specificity about how public charge is defined—and 26 years of precedent governing which benefits use should be considered—the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would give frontline officers vast discretion in applying the law.

The withdrawal of earlier federal guidance would mean that service providers could no longer provide any bright-line instruction to immigrant families about which public benefits are safe to access without harming future immigration options and which are not. The rule leaves open the possibility that even use of Head Start, free school lunch, care at Community Health Centers, or other programs could hurt future green-card applications.

If finalized as written, the administration’s sweeping moves could also jeopardize the use of public benefits by the U.S.-citizen children of immigrants. The proposed rule would eliminate current (and past) language that states the use of public benefits by family members does not count against green-card applicants.

The likely result will be that many immigrant families will be afraid to access any public benefits for which a household member is eligible, forgoing supports in times of need to preserve future immigration prospects. Noncitizens who are eligible for public benefits already utilize them at lower rates than the U.S. born. And most immigrants eligible for public benefits already have a green card or U.S. citizenship, and therefore would not face a future public-charge test. But given the complexities of benefits eligibility and immigration laws, hundreds of thousands of people in immigrant families—if not more—may nonetheless feel deterred from accessing needed supports.

As the proposed rule itself recognizes, this could lead to “worse health outcomes” for immigrants and communities, as well as “increased poverty, housing instability, reduced productivity, and lower educational attainment.” In doing so, the futures of millions of U.S.-citizen children may be hampered.

History of Public Charge

Since 1882, federal law has barred the immigration of people likely to become a public charge. Public-charge assessments apply to visa applicants abroad and green-card applicants within the United States. (Refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and certain other humanitarian groups are exempt.)

U.S. law never formally defined the term public charge until 1999, when the Clinton administration issued a definition: Individuals who were “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence” with determinations of public charge required to rest on either receipt of cash assistance (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF] or Supplemental Security Income [SSI]) or long-term institutionalization at government expense. That definition, put in place to counter the chilling effects that arose after mid-1990s changes to welfare law, remained until the first Trump term.

Changes During the First Trump Term

In 2019, DHS issued a regulation to substantially broaden the definition of public charge to include anyone who received certain public benefits for more than 12 months in a 36-month period. This regulation extensively detailed which prior public benefits use would count in a public-charge determination. Importantly, it also specified what would not be considered: use of benefits not explicitly listed in the rule, benefits use by applicants’ family members or that occurred before the final regulation, and the use of Medicaid by children or during pregnancy.

Litigation limited how long the new rule was in force. However, even before its implementation, news of the coming change caused immigrant families to disenroll from public benefits or never sign up. In December 2018, roughly one in seven adults in immigrant families said they or their relatives had avoided public benefits out of fear of immigration consequences. Even 9 percent of adults in U.S.-citizen families said their family had avoided benefits use. The impacts also extended to U.S.-citizen children. The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) found that public benefits use fell twice as fast between 2016 and 2019 for U.S.-citizen children who lived with noncitizens as for those who lived only with citizens—even though children’s benefits use had no bearing on public-charge tests.

A Brief Restoration

In 2021, the Biden administration restored the 1999 definition, codifying it in regulation in 2022.

The Trump administration now seeks to void that 2022 regulation, without issuing new guidelines. DHS says it will issue future instructions for adjudicators; that guidance will likely not be offered for public scrutiny before it takes force.

Chilling Effects Ahead

If clear guidelines are abolished, immigrant families may avoid using any public benefit for which they are eligible—not least because they and the service providers tasked with helping them could be left with no way to predict which usage by any family member could hurt a noncitizen’s future immigration prospects.

The chilling effects are likely to be far greater than those observed during the first Trump term, for several reasons. First, the elimination of all guidelines on which benefits will be considered leaves open the possibility that welfare-adjacent programs, including child-care subsidies, public health programs, or even use of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) could potentially block future immigration. Second, the rule opens the possibility that family members’ benefits use will count against immigrants. Noncitizen parents may therefore worry about enrolling their children in any government program. And third, the rule comes amid a range of other compounding policy changes.

The proposed rule follows recent congressional cuts to key benefits programs for refugees, asylees, humanitarian parolees, and other lawfully present immigrants, further complicating already confusing eligibility rules. At the same time, federal agencies are moving to classify a range of additional programs—such as Head Start, Community Health Centers, family planning, and adult education—as “federal public benefits.” These changes suggest use of these programs could potentially be considered in a public-charge test. Finally, ramped-up and highly visible immigration enforcement and efforts to share public-benefit application data with DHS already are chilling benefits use by immigrant families.

Because of the prevalence of mixed-status families, millions of benefits recipients—primarily U.S. citizens or green-card holders—live with relatives hoping to obtain permanent residence. For example, MPI estimates that 5.3 million U.S.-citizen children lived in mid-2023 with an unauthorized immigrant parent (only a fraction of whom received public benefits). If even a small share of people in mixed-status households withdrew from benefits, hundreds of thousands of children could lose access to vital economic supports.

Effects on Future Immigration

The proposed rule’s lack of guidelines for applying a public-charge test could also significantly affect future immigration, depending on how adjudicators exercise their discretion. Already, the State Department has instructed consular officers to consider visa applicants’ age and health, including obesity and mental health, in deciding if someone is likely to become a public charge.

The new proposed rule asserts that immigrants who cannot be self-sufficient or supported by family or private entities should not be granted permanent status in the country. But consular and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers are not experts in how health conditions or past benefits use predict future self-sufficiency. Research shows immigrants often use public benefits as a launching pad to future economic success. And a strong body of research shows that children who receive economic supports in childhood have better health, education, and employment outcomes in adulthood.

Further, decades of court and administrative decisions have established that time-limited benefits receipt, on its own, should not cast someone as likely to become a public charge, particularly if the person can work or has family support. But the proposed rule provides no assurance that DHS will train adjudicators on this case law.

Without clear guidance, rulings may vary widely from adjudicator to adjudicator. Individual biases could animate decisions, potentially reshaping the face of U.S. immigration. The recent DHS framing of officers as “homeland defenders” charged with protecting U.S. culture also raises serious questions about the environment shaping future decisions.

Intended Chilling Effects?

The proposed rule is likely to be finalized in early 2026. It will probably face litigation, but the courts may allow the rule to take effect even as legal challenges proceed.

If the final rule looks similar to the draft, the main impact may well be sharp reductions in the number of U.S. citizens and green-card holders in immigrant families who access a wide range of public benefits.

This could have serious implications for family and community well-being during times of need. Parents may forgo health-care services and child-care, housing, and food supports that help them achieve stable employment, secure safe housing, and reach self-sufficiency. Spells of family poverty without access to medical, nutrition, housing, and other supports can hamper children’s health, development, educational attainment, and future success. And the effects can extend into communities, affecting health, school environments, and even local economies.

The immigration consequences are less certain. With adjudicators’ unconstrained discretion, immigration decisions may be highly variable and unpredictable.

DHS acknowledges the proposed rule could harm the health and wellbeing of children and families. If the Trump administration wanted to reduce these harms, it could clarify that children’s benefits usage will not be used against parents, or that use of certain basic health, education, and housing programs would not be considered.

But the proposed rule’s acknowledgment of likely harmful impacts suggests that perhaps the chilling effects are, after all, part of the intended outcome.",https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/commentary_photos/Short%20Read-Public%20Charge-Jan2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:12:53.640877

Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting.
“Well,” Mr. Trump said.
“I — the way I look at it … ” “It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video.","President Trump wanted to run the tape.

Just hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Mr. Trump told a group of New York Times reporters that the woman was at fault because she had tried to “run over” the officer.

We were in the Oval Office for an interview with the president, and the unfolding situation in Minneapolis was high on our list of questions. As soon as we started asking him about the incident, he said: “I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either.”

When we pressed Mr. Trump on his conclusion that the victim, Renee Nicole Good, tried to run over the agent, he asked an aide to pull up the video on a laptop in an effort to prove his point.

“That was a vicious situation that took place,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to what federal officials have said was an effort by Ms. Good to run down an ICE agent.

The exchange was a glimpse into Mr. Trump’s reflexive defense of what has become a sometimes violent federal crackdown on immigration, which in this case claimed the life of an American citizen who was protesting ICE’s presence in Minneapolis.

On Thursday, after our interview with the president, a Times analysis of footage from three camera angles showed the motorist was driving away from — not toward — a federal officer when he opened fire.

But on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump stuck to his position even as we pointed out the inconsistencies in his account and the lack of clarity in videos circulating on social media. We asked if, in his mind, firing into a vehicle like that was acceptable.

“She behaved horribly,” Mr. Trump said. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over.”

We told the president that the early videos circulating online were unclear.

“I’ll play the tape for you right now,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump’s aide Natalie Harp brought a laptop over to the Resolute Desk to show us what he said would be evidence of the woman’s wrongdoing.

Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting. “With all of it being said, no, I don’t like that happening,” he said, before pivoting to his common refrain of criticizing illegal immigration.

As a slow-motion surveillance video of the shooting played on the laptop, we told him that this angle did not appear to show that an ICE officer had been run over.

“Well,” Mr. Trump said. “I — the way I look at it … ”

“It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”

But did this fatal shooting mean his ICE operation had gone too far? Mr. Trump sidestepped the question, instead blaming his predecessor’s immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:57:20.916652

Since early December, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations – many of them masked and brandishing rifles – have grabbed people at hardware stores and gyms, or outside homes and schools around the cities. They have violently tackled undocumented immigrants as well as US citizens, including advocates and protesters.

By the time Macklin Good was shot on Wednesday – in broad daylight, as dozens of bystanders screamed in shock – local leaders and human rights advocates had been bracing for a catastrophe.

“Before this administration, I don’t think we’ve ever seen this kind of hyper-militarized enforcement, with surges of thousands of officers,” said Setareh Ghandehari, the advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, a non-profit that tracks deaths in ICE custody. Advocates like Ghandehari have warned that more deaths could come, and that shows of force make everyone in the country less safe.

“I don’t think we should be surprised that this has been happening.” she said. “And unfortunately I think there is definitely a chance of an incident like this happening again if the administration and ICE continue to be allowed to act with impunity and without any semblance of accountability.”

Just a few days into 2026, the mobilization in Minneapolis suggests the administration has no plans of easing indiscriminate immigration enforcement operations that have defined the president’s second term.

Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, immigration officers have been connected to 14 shootings, including at least four fatal shootings, according to data compiled by the Trace, a non-profit newsroom focused on gun violence in the US. In September, immigration officers shot Silverio Villegas González, an undocumented immigrant, during a vehicle stop on the outskirts of Chicago.

In Good’s case – as in Villegas González’s case and the cases of non-fatal officer shootings – the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Good “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers”, a statement that appeared to be contradicted by eyewitness accounts and videos of the incident. On several occasions, judges have dismissed cases in which ICE agents accused people they shot of attempting to hurt officers with vehicles.

Shootings have not been the only cause of death amid immigration raids. In October, a 24-year-old Honduran man died while trying to flee ICE agents in Virginia. In July, a farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during an ICE raid in California.

And 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the deadliest year for the agency since 2004.

“Over the past year, the Trump administration has granted ICE agents virtual impunity to visit terror and violence on immigrant communities across our country,” said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center. “The violence has to stop, immediately.”

The administration has justified its massive – and ultimately deadly – show of force in the Twin Cities as necessary to root out criminals, a refrain it used in other operations last year. But a preliminary analysis from Minnesota Public Radio of who is being arrested in the raids show that most of those targeted have no criminal convictions. Overall, most of the immigrants arrested by ICE since the beginning of the second Trump term have no criminal records.

In Minneapolis, residents and organizers were bracing for more violence. Hours after Good’s death, about 3 miles (5km) from where she was shot on Wednesday, armed immigration officers descended on Minneapolis’s Roosevelt high school, tackled people, handcuffed two staff members and released chemical weapons on bystanders, school officials told MPR.

“They don’t care. They’re just animals,” a school official told the station. “I’ve never seen people behave like this.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf370ebe862185cba863add91e59906c19062a7a/617_0_4627_3701/master/4627.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17e808b3bdc7e03cf8defe240b5352a8",N,,2026-01-08 11:57:33.775737

Additionally, according to the court, ""most cases in this and other districts have also recognized that website-based trackers can plausibly constitute a pen register.""
In Greenley, the court latched onto CIPA's supposedly ""expansive"" and ""vague"" definition of pen register to reach the conclusion that software which identifies consumers, gathers data, and correlates that data through unique fingerprinting could constitute a pen register.
Importantly, Camplisson illustrates the significant uncertainty that persists as to the precise scope and contours of CIPA pen register/trap and trace claims.
Regardless of liability theory, consent has, and will continue to serve, as the strongest defense to CIPA class action claims.","In a recent decision that could reshape the CIPA litigation landscape, Camplisson v. Adidas Am., Inc., 2025 WL 3228949 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2025), a California federal court rejected several recent decisions dismissing substantively identical CIPA pen register/trap and trace claims. The court held that allegations of Adidas installing tracking pixels on website visitors' browsers that recorded their personally identifiable information (PII) were sufficient, without more, to plausibly allege use of a pen register device and therefore to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Following Camplisson, businesses are likely to see yet another substantial uptick in the already high volume of CIPA pre-suit demand letters and class action lawsuits, which have continued to plague website owners and operators for several years now. More than that, the decision highlights the significant uncertainty that persists with many of the core issues at the heart of CIPA disputes, while underscoring the need for companies to work proactively with privacy counsel.

Background of CIPA

Enacted in 1967 in response to concerns over eavesdropping and telephone surveillance, CIPA makes it illegal to intercept communications or aid and abet third parties in doing so. In addition, under Penal Code § 638.51 (CIPA § 638.51), CIPA prohibits the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices without a court order or user consent. The law provides for the recovery of statutory damages of $5,000 per violation, even in the absence of any actual injury or harm, as well as attorney's fees in certain instances.

Historically, pen registers and trap and trace devices were used by law enforcement while conducting telephone surveillance, with pen registers capturing the phone numbers of outgoing calls and trap and trace devices doing the same for incoming calls. CIPA defines pen register as ""a device or process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of a communication."" The critical distinction between pen registers and other devices is that the former is designed to capture information about a communication, but not the content of the communication itself.

Camplisson v. Adidas Am., Inc.

In Camplisson, website visitors brought a putative class action against Adidas, alleging it violated CIPA § 638.51 through its website's use of two ""tracking pixels,"" the TikTok Pixel and Microsoft Bing, installed on the visitors' web browsers without their consent. According to the plaintiffs, the trackers purportedly collected IP addresses, browser information, unique identifiers, and other PII and addressing information. The plaintiffs also alleged the trackers used so-called ""device fingerprinting,"" a process that associates information collected through the trackers with other PII to facilitate specific device activity tracking.

Adidas moved to dismiss, arguing (among other things) the trackers did not meet the statutory definition of a pen register, thus precluding the plaintiffs' CIPA § 638.51 claim as a matter of law, because:

The trackers only captured specific outgoing information, as opposed to all outgoing communications, from a given device; and

The information collected through fingerprinting was substantive, rather than mere dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information.

The court rejected both arguments. Relying on CIPA's purportedly ""intentionally broad language,"" it found that limiting pen registers to a process that collects all information would ""take away from CIPA's purpose of protecting privacy, making it underinclusive."" Additionally, according to the court, ""most cases in this and other districts have also recognized that website-based trackers can plausibly constitute a pen register."" Turning to the dispute before it, the court held the plaintiffs' allegations that the trackers recorded their PII, including the information contained in an IP address, were sufficient to plausibly allege use of a pen register and, in turn, avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Adidas also argued that the plaintiffs' consent barred their CIPA claims as a matter of law. The court disagreed, finding the website did not:

Make Adidas's online terms and conditions sufficiently conspicuous, as website visitors were required to find the details of the terms and Adidas's privacy policy by scrolling down to the footer of its site; or

Offer a pop-up window or similar method for visitors to affirmatively demonstrate their assent to Adidas's online terms.

Accordingly, the court held the plaintiffs were not put on notice of the terms and privacy policy outlining Adidas's use of the trackers and, thus, did not consent to the use of pen registers on their web browsers.

Analysis & Takeaways

The seminal CIPA pen register/trap and trace decisions, which opened the floodgates to the current wave of class action filings, are Greenley v. Kochava, Inc., 684 F. Supp. 3d 1024 (S.D. Cal. 2023), and Moody v. C2 Educ. Sys., Inc., 742 F. Supp. 3d 1072 (C.D. Cal. 2024). In Greenley, the court latched onto CIPA's supposedly ""expansive"" and ""vague"" definition of pen register to reach the conclusion that software which identifies consumers, gathers data, and correlates that data through unique fingerprinting could constitute a pen register. Shortly thereafter, in Moody the court declined to ""foreclose the possibility that software may qualify as a pen register or trap and trace device under California law, at least at the motion to dismiss stage.""

The plaintiff's bar used these two decisions as a springboard to launch their newest campaign of class action filings for purported violations of CIPA § 638.51. In the early stages of these cases, defendants had considerable difficulty in achieving dismissals at the pleading stage. However, last year multiple courts issued defendant-favorable rulings dismissing CIPA § 638.51 class actions, including Price v. Headspace, Inc., 2025 WL 1237977 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Apr. 1, 2025), Kishnani v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., 2025 WL 1745726 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2025), Mitchener v. Talkspace Network LLC, 2025 WL 1822801 (C.D. Cal. June 27, 2025), and Mitchener v. CuriosityStream, Inc., 2025 WL 227413 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2025), all of which held the TikTok Pixel definitionally does not fall under the ambit of CIPA § 638.51. More importantly, these opinions called this particular CIPA liability theory into question altogether, indicating a potential shift in the trajectory of pen register/trap and trace disputes.

That sliver of hope may be short-lived if additional courts follow the reasoning of Camplisson, which squarely rejected Headspace, Royal Caribbean, Talkspace, and CuriosityStream. Importantly, Camplisson illustrates the significant uncertainty that persists as to the precise scope and contours of CIPA pen register/trap and trace claims. Looking ahead, courts will likely continue to issue conflicting decisions on CIPA's applicability and scope, with businesses remaining subject to substantial legal risk and liability exposure tied to the use of digital tracking tools for the foreseeable future.

What to Do Now: Strategic Compliance and Risk Mitigation Measures

While the CIPA legal landscape remains in flux, it is imperative that all companies that have a website work with experienced privacy counsel to evaluate their current practices and implement risk mitigation strategies as part of their comprehensive privacy compliance programs. Doing so ensures compliance with CIPA's statutory requirements and helps manage the considerable legal risk and associated potential liability arising from the high volume of privacy- and technology-related class action filings focused on cookies, pixels, and other digital tracking tools – which will only increase as time progresses.

As an initial roadmap, companies should prioritize the following action items.

Affirmative, Meaningful Consent. Regardless of liability theory, consent has, and will continue to serve, as the strongest defense to CIPA class action claims. Accordingly, effective, dependable methods and mechanisms must be in place for securing affirmative, meaningful consent from website visitors. Clickwraps, which require visitors to take a clear, affirmative action – such as clicking a button or ticking a box – after being presented with an online agreement or privacy disclosure to signify their assent, should be used, as courts regularly uphold their validity. Consent mechanisms should be tested prior to initial deployment to confirm no cookies or similar technologies ""drop"" or ""fire"" until consent has been affirmatively manifested.

Privacy Disclosures. Privacy policies, notices, and other external-facing disclosures must clearly and conspicuously disclose all tracking technologies in use on any digital property. Disclosures should also provide detailed descriptions of all other tools that may collect, use, or share PII, such as through session replay software or the deployment of video content. Online terms and similar agreements may need to include arbitration and class action waiver provisions. All disclosures must be accurate and reflect actual data practices.

Digital Audits. Regularly assess and evaluate all digital tracking tools and how they collect and process PII. In particular, closely evaluate whether PII is shared with third parties, as this has become an increasingly significant target of plaintiffs' attorneys and privacy regulators alike. At the same time, audit all tracking tools deployed by third parties to ensure they are compliant with applicable law and contractual obligations.

Vendor Agreements. Ensure that vendor agreements where PII is implicated by way of digital tracking tools contain language: (a) requiring vendor compliance with applicable law governing the use of digital tools and PII; (b) limiting vendor data use to what is necessary for performance under the agreement; (c) barring any vendor sharing or disclosure of PII for any reason without prior express consent; and (d) requiring vendor indemnification for any claims, losses, expenses, and fees (including attorney's fees) arising from any actual or alleged legal noncompliance or contractual breach relating to the handling of PII.

Demand Letter Response Playbooks. Be prepared with demand letter response playbooks containing documentation that conclusively establishes legal and regulatory compliance, as well as pre-scripted negotiation strategy guidance. Where feasible, consider maintaining digital audit analyses and reports that are generated by the same tools used by plaintiffs' attorneys.

The Final Word

In today's digital world, companies with even a small digital footprint face mounting legal risks and liability exposure stemming from the extremely common (and often unknown) use of cookies, pixels, and other digital tracking tools. Implementing strategic compliance and risk mitigation measures as part of comprehensive compliance programs can directly address and mitigate the threats posed by the high volume of CIPA and similar privacy class action filings, which will only continue to increase for the foreseeable future.

As we begin 2026, now is the perfect time to consult with experienced privacy counsel, who can review and audit current compliance practices and assist in remediating any gaps to minimize the risk of being targeted with CIPA or other wiretapping class action claims. Robust, comprehensive compliance measures, such as those discussed above, can also arm companies with formidable defenses in the event they find themselves on the receiving end of a tenuous CIPA demand letter or class action complaint.",https://www.bakerdonelson.com/images/_wbmanaged/screenshot2026-01-08124146_wbc_socialimage_167329.png,N,,2026-01-08 14:58:56.495061

Minnesota officials condemned those remarks.

Democratic Governor Tim Walz issued an order to prepare to mobilize the Minnesota National Guard, calling Good’s killing “preventable” and “unnecessary.” This is Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit. This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed. … To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.”

This comes after the Trump administration ordered a surge of 2,000 ICE agents to the Twin Cities this week, after President Trump called the region’s large Somali community “garbage” and accused state officials of failing to root out fraud in social services programs.

The killing of Renee Nicole Good was at least the ninth time federal immigration officers have fired on people since last September; five people have died in mass deportation operations since President Trump retook the White House. After headlines, we’ll go to Minneapolis for the latest.

The Trump administration has announced plans to control sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” as it demands Venezuela’s government cut ties with U.S. adversaries, including Cuba, China, Iran and Russia. On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the U.S. would continue to “dictate” policy to Venezuela’s interim leaders, after the abduction of President Nicolás Maduro in a bloody U.S. military raid on Caracas early Saturday morning.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt: “The president is fully deploying his 'peace through strength' foreign policy agenda, so we’re continuing to be in close coordination with the interim authorities. And their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America.”

On Wednesday, U.S. forces seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports — one in the Caribbean; the other, a Russian-flagged tanker in the North Atlantic that the U.S. had pursued for weeks. In response, Russia accused the U.S. of violating maritime law, calling for the release of the ship’s crew. Their capture came as Vice President JD Vance reiterated that the Trump administration would have complete control of Venezuela’s oil reserves. In Caracas, interim President Delcy Rodríguez defended plans to cede control of Venezuela’s oil to the U.S.

Interim President Delcy Rodríguez: “Venezuela is open to energy relations where all parties benefit, where economic cooperation is very well determined in commercial contracts.”

On Wednesday, President Trump told The New York Times he expects the United States will be running Venezuela for years to come. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interior minister said 100 people were killed in the U.S. attack that removed President Maduro from power on Saturday. We’ll have more on Venezuela later in the broadcast.

In Sudan, at least 13 people have been killed, including eight children, after a drone strike hit a house in the city of el-Obeid — that’s according to the Sudan Doctors’ Network. The group says that it was likely carried out by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group. Meanwhile, several Sudanese women recounted harrowing stories of rape by the RSF to Al Jazeera. A senior doctor revealed that 14 infants were raped. The U.N. describes the situation in Sudan as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, as the civil war between the Sudanese army and the RSF has been raging for nearly three years. More than 11 million people have been displaced, and over 150,000 people have been killed.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.

The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant’s visa expired. Some licenses were also given to citizens of Mexico and Canada who don’t qualify. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.

But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.

Key European allies are criticizing U.S. global leadership in the wake of tensions over Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has a largely ceremonial role, warned of a major realignment in unusually strong remarks at an event in Berlin last night.

Steinmeier said there had been a “breakdown of values by our most important partner, the USA, which helped build this world order,” according to a translation by Reuters.

He added: “It is about preventing the world from turning into a den of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want, where regions or entire countries are treated as the property of a few great powers.”

France’s President Emmanuel Macron also criticized U.S. leadership in separate remarks this morning, saying that events in recent days have confirmed “major global powers are seeking to divide the world among themselves.”

Macron told a gathering of ambassadors that the U.S. was “gradually turning away from some of its allies and giving up on established rules.”

Macron also criticized China, Russia and Iran, adding: “We are in a world where might is right, and perhaps Europe is the only forum now where we can reaffirm these values and rules so dear to us.”

Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., announced yesterday that she will introduce articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for what Kelly calls “obstruction of justice, violation of public trust, and self-dealing.”

Any member of the House can introduce articles of impeachment against a Cabinet official. No action has to be taken on those articles. Republicans, who control the floor and committees, will not bring this impeachment resolution forward.

Kelly could try to introduce this impeachment under the privileges of the House, which would request a vote on the matter within two legislative days. In that scenario, Republicans can offer a “motion to table” or “motion to refer to committee,” to sideline the effort. Kelly does not specify in her press release that she will attempt this route.

Other Democrats have introduced impeachment resolutions of Trump and Cabinet officials this Congress that have gone nowhere:

Rep. Al Green, of Texas, has introduced articles of impeachment against Trump several times.

Rep. Shri Thanedar, of Michigan, introduced articles of impeachment against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Rep. Haley Stevens, of Michigan, introduced articles of impeachment against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Kelly is currently running for the Senate in Illinois.

The State Department said it had paused all U.S. assistance to Somalia’s federal government, citing reports that officials had destroyed a U.S.-funded World Food Program warehouse and “illegally seized” 76 metric tons of food aid meant for civilians in the East African country, one of the world’s poorest.

“The Trump Administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance,” the department said yesterday in a post on X.

“Any resumption of assistance will be dependent upon the Somali Federal Government, taking accountability for its unacceptable actions and taking appropriate remedial steps,” it said.

Somali officials have not yet responded to the allegations. It is unclear how much assistance will be affected, as the Trump administration made drastic cuts to U.S. foreign aid last year.

The pause in assistance comes amid mounting White House attacks on Somali immigrants in the U.S., including over unsubstantiated claims of fraud at child care centers in Minnesota. The Trump administration has increased immigration raids in Minneapolis, home to the country’s largest Somali community, and Somalia is one of 19 countries whose nationals are barred from entering the U.S., as well as continuing their immigration applications.

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., will announce this morning that he is not seeking re-election, a spokesperson for the congressman confirmed to NBC News.

The 86-year-old is among the longest-serving members of Congress, having held his seat since he won a special election in 1981. Hoyer plans to make his formal announcement when he speaks on the House floor at 10 a.m.

“I did not want to be one of those members who clearly stayed, outstayed his or her ability to do the job,” Hoyer told The Washington Post about his retirement plan.

Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., announced in a video this morning that he is running for re-election.

""We've gotten s--- done all across our commonwealth to make a real difference in people's lives,"" he said in a video posted on X, laying out his credentials for issues including job growth, championing public safety and cutting taxes.

Shapiro won his 2022 race for governor with 56.5% of the vote, while his Republican opponent Doug Mastriano garnered 41.7%. The swing state is often a bellwether for the direction of the country's politics.

Earlier this week, he announced that his campaign for governor ended last year with more than $30 million on hand.

The governor has often been floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender.

The Senate will vote this morning on whether to advance a resolution that would require congressional authorization before the military can engage in additional hostilities within or against Venezuela.

The resolution, which only needs a simple majority to advance, is the first congressional test of whether Republicans will publicly oppose Trump’s actions against Venezuela after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

The vote would be to discharge the resolution to the full Senate. It was introduced by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Rand Paul, R-Ky., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, and Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

“This is not the surgical execution of an arrest warrant, it was much bigger than that before last Saturday, and it’s going to be much bigger than that from now for the next few years,” Kaine told reporters yesterday. “So, this is something that shouldn’t happen without Congress.”

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., released a statement opposing the resolution, calling it “the wrong message to send to hardened drug traffickers and to dictators.”

“Let’s be clear about what that resolution does and what it does not do,” Barrasso said in a statement. “It does not reassert Congress’s powers. It does not make America stronger. It makes America weaker and less safe. It would weaken the President’s legitimate, constitutional authority.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/250107-trump-jan-8-liveblog-lr-782615.jpg",N,,2026-01-08 09:57:54.701276

Tim Walz derided what he called a federal “propaganda machine,” saying that the shooting was both “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable.”

The outpouring of anger from the Democrats who govern Minnesota marked a boiling-over point in a rhetorical fight with the Trump administration that had been building for weeks.

The next steps in that dispute seemed uncertain.

Federal officials, who vowed to continue a surge of immigration enforcement work in the Minneapolis area despite protests, defended the shooting on Wednesday as necessary and lawful.

“This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.

Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz both warned demonstrators to stay peaceful, stating their belief that the federal government was looking for a pretext to deploy the military on Minnesota’s streets.

“Do not take the bait,” Mr. Walz said. “Do not allow them to deploy federal troops into here. Do not allow them to invoke the Insurrection Act. Do not allow them to declare martial law.”

Bad blood between Mr. Walz and President Trump is nothing new. Mr. Trump has long criticized the governor’s handling of the riots that followed the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, and the pair exchanged campaign-trail insults in 2024 when Mr. Walz was the Democratic nominee for vice president. When a gunman killed a Democratic Minnesota state legislator and her husband last year, Mr. Trump said he had no plans to call Mr. Walz, whom he described as “whacked out.” Mr. Walz, for his part, criticized immigration agents last year as “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.”

But that mutual distaste morphed into a far more tangible clash in recent weeks, as the president and his allies portrayed Minnesota as a failure of liberal governance, citing a fraud scheme that resulted in hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars being pilfered from social service programs. The president began describing Minnesota’s large Somali diaspora, whose members make up a majority of the fraud defendants, in especially derisive terms. Immigration agents briefly surged into the state last month, sometimes clashing with residents.

All of it was prelude to this week, when the federal government announced the deployment of around 2,000 agents to the Minneapolis area in what it said was its “largest operation to date.” The mobilization, they said, was necessary to crack down on fraud and to root out illegal immigrants.

ICE agent shoots and kills woman during Minneapolis immigration crackdown

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city's mayor described as ""reckless"" and unnecessary.

The woman was shot in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her killing quickly drew a crowd of angry protesters.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor said.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the Minneapolis woman, whose name wasn't immediately released, was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. During her Texas visit, Noem confirmed that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area and said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the 37-year-old driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,"" the chief said. ""At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

DeSantis announces special legislative session on redistricting

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced during a press conference Wednesday that he is calling for a special legislative session to tackle redistricting.

“Today, I announced that I will be convening a Special Session of the Legislature focused on redistricting to ensure that Florida’s congressional maps accurately reflect the population of our state. Every Florida resident deserves to be represented fairly and constitutionally,” DeSantis posted on X and Facebook.

The governor said that the planned special session would begin after the regular legislative session. That would, in DeSantis’ opinion, free up lawmakers to “focus on the pressing issues facing Floridians.”

The Florida Legislature took its first official step in early December toward potentially redrawing the state’s congressional districts as lawmakers convened a new House committee tasked with exploring possible changes.

At least six other states are redrawing maps, or at least attempting to, ahead of this year’s midterm election. Florida’s redistricting process is somewhat unique, however, because of its 2010 “Fair Districts” constitutional amendment, which prohibits maps drawn to favor political parties or incumbents.

“Florida voters approved the Fair District Amendments in 2010 because we wanted to rid our system of this type of partisan gerrymandering and rigging for political gain,” said Genesis Robinson of the voting rights group Equal Ground.

Over the summer, President Donald Trump urged Republican-led states to redraw their congressional maps to expand the GOP majority in Congress, alleging Democratic leaders in other states have gerrymandered maps of their own. DeSantis reaffirmed his administration’s intent to follow along, noting the state will likely pursue changes if and when the U.S. Supreme Court rethinks federal redistricting rules.

“We’re going to do it,” DeSantis said. “And part of it is we’re going to be forced to do it, I think, because the Supreme Court’s VRA decision is going to impact the current map. So just no matter what else happens, that is going to have to be addressed.”

The governor’s plan, though, will require House and Senate cooperation.

“Three people have to turn the keys at the same time in order to get new maps,” said Jonathan Webber of the Southern Poverty Law Center. “And right now, it does not seem like all three people are aligned. And maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe it’s a bad thing. But overall, it’s a bad thing for the people of Florida that there is not clear leadership from their leaders.”

Thus far, the Senate has taken no action on the issue. In a memo, Senate President Ben Albritton said work on redistricting may launch in the new year.

“The Governor has expressed a desire to address this issue next spring,” Albritton said in a statement. “As such, there is no ongoing work regarding potential mid-decade redistricting taking place in the Senate at this time.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ice-shooting-protesters_AP_Cropped,N,,2026-01-08 10:59:32.076010

Jacob Frey: I have a message for ICE. To ICE, get the f*** out of Minneapolis.

Rachel Hayter: 2,000 federal agents were deployed to the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul as part of the Trump administration's latest crackdown on immigration. But today, that law enforcement operation went fatally wrong.

Rachel Hayter: Footage shows an SUV blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. A crowd of people who appear to be protesting are lining the footpaths. Multiple law enforcement vehicles appear and immigration agents start ordering the woman behind the wheel to get out. One of the ICE agents tugs at the driver's side door handle. Another, near the front of the vehicle, opens fire as the SUV attempts to drive away. 37-year-old woman Renee Nicole Good is killed. In a post on Truth Social, the US President Donald Trump says an ICE officer was viciously run over, though videos of the incident appear to indicate that's not the case. Even so, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem insists the officer opened fire in self-defence.

Kristi Noem: It was an act of domestic terrorism. What happened was our ICE officers were out in enforcement action. They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis. They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday during the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in the head in front of a family member in a snowy residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Her killing after 9:30 a.m. was recorded on video by witnesses, and the shooting quickly drew a large crowd of angry protesters. By evening, hundreds were there for a vigil to mourn her death and urge the public to resist immigration enforcers.

The woman, Renee Nicole Macklin Good, had a 6-year old child, her mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Macklin Good described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” who was from Colorado.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear in the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer and there is no indication of whether or not the woman had interactions with ICE officers before the videos started. After the shooting, the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

In another video taken at the scene, a woman, who described Macklin Good as her spouse, is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who was not identified, said the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

In a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.

Local officials dispute the narrative

Noem claimed the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the veteran officer who fired his gun had been rammed and dragged by an anti-ICE motorist in June.

“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” Noem said, adding that the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem’s version of what happened as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor said.

Shooting is fifth linked to crackdowns

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the woman in Minneapolis was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Noem said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

“She was driving away and they killed her,” said Lynette Reini-Grandell, a local resident who was among those who filmed the shooting.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers, chanting “ICE out of Minnesota” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Governor calls for calm

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He described the killing as “predictable” and “avoidable.” He also said like many, he was outraged by the shooting, but he called on people to keep protests peaceful.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said.

Minneapolis Public Schools canceled school, sports and activities for Thursday and Friday, saying in a statement that the decision was “due to safety concerns related to today’s incidents around the city.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone.

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot the driver. Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,” Jacobson told reporters.

The shooting happened in the district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it “state violence,” not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

Local and federal officials were immediately divided on how the shooting unfolded. President Trump and other federal officials asserted that the agent acted “in self-defense,” while Minnesota officials described those accounts as “propaganda” and “garbage.”

On Wednesday night, thousands of people gathered to protest at a vigil as the shooting reignited the debate on the deployment of federal agents and troops in cities across the country. Local and state leaders implored the administration to withdraw federal agents from Minnesota.

Here’s what we know:

What happened in the encounter?

In videos posted on social media and verified by The New York Times, a maroon Honda Pilot is shown partly blocking one lane of a snowy residential street. The driver of the S.U.V. rolls forward slightly, then stops and waves to signal that approaching vehicles should drive past.

The vehicle is shifted from reverse into drive and begins to move ahead. The agent at the front of the vehicle, standing near the driver’s side headlight, pulls out a gun and fires at the driver, continuing to shoot as the vehicle moves past him.

The Honda accelerates and then crashes. The agent who fired approaches the vehicle, then walks away and tells other agents to call 911.

One witness who spoke with The Times described seeing an ICE agent trying to rip open the Honda’s door, while hearing another agent in front of the vehicle shouting “Stop!” before quickly firing.

Who is the victim?

The authorities identified the driver as Renee Nicole Good, 37. Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen, lived in Minneapolis with her partner, her mother said in an interview with The Minnesota Star Tribune.

Ms. Good had a 6-year-old child and was “loving, forgiving and affectionate,” her mother, Donna Ganger, told The Star Tribune.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said in a news conference that there was “nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation.”

How have officials responded?

Officials clashed over the details of the shooting, with local officials describing it as avoidable and federal officials defending the use of force.

In a post on social media, Mr. Trump said he believed the agent had shot the driver in self-defense and falsely claimed the woman “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over” the officer.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said at a news conference that the woman was “stalking” officers, and that the agent who killed her “used his training to save his life and those of his colleagues.”

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis called federal accounts of the shooting “bullshit.” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota urged residents to protest peacefully and said on social media, “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

Why have federal agents deployed in Minnesota?

The Trump administration began an immigration crackdown in Minnesota last month, deploying scores of federal agents to the state. Federal immigration officers on Tuesday described their presence in Minnesota as the “largest operation to date.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement effort in the state is part of a broader deportation push that has targeted cities across the country since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term.

Immigration efforts in Minnesota have targeted undocumented immigrants, like in other cities, but singled out Somalis. The state has roughly 80,000 people of Somali ancestry, but the vast majority are American citizens or legal permanent residents.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07nat-minn-ice-shooting-wwk-2-vmqp/07nat-minn-ice-shooting-wwk-2-vmqp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:59:05.515530

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this week that a shutdown was not on the table.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked if the appropriations process should be used to constrain ICE, told us: ""We're focused right now on … advancing the Affordable Care Act tax credits.""

But progressive lawmakers see the end-of-January funding cliff as a leverage point to exploit, as they fume about the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem.

""Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn't restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on X following the shooting.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said: ""We can't just keep authorizing money for these illegal killers. That's what they are, this rogue force.""

""Statements and letters are not enough, and the appropriations process and the CR expiring Jan. 31 is our opportunity,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.).

Between the lines: Getting both sides to agree on funding for a department as divisive as DHS was always going to prove challenging.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) told us today: ""I'm having a hard time seeing how we're gonna come to agreement on it.""

""We need to arrest that ICE agent for a excessive use of power,"" Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told us. ""And we should be opposing the hundreds of billions of dollars going to a lawless agency.""

The other side: Among the Republicans defending ICE after the shooting are several members of leadership, including House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and House Republican conference chair Lisa McClain (R-Mich.).

""Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals. May God bless and protect them in their efforts,"" Emmer said in a statement.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.""

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies, and commissions, following his administration's review of participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House release.

WATCH: White House pushes to dismantle leading climate and weather research center

Most of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor, migration and other issues the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and ""woke"" initiatives. Other non-U.N. organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Global Counterterrorism Forum.

""The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,"" the State Department said in a statement.

Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.

This is the latest U.S. withdrawal from global agencies

The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO as it has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump's agenda and those which no longer serve U.S. interests.

WATCH: The potential impacts of Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization

""I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is 'my way or the highway,'"" said Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group. ""It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington's own terms.""

It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations — both Republican and Democratic — have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.

Many independent nongovernmental agencies — some that work with the United Nations — have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Despite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The global organizations from which the U.S. is departing

The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.

UNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump — who calls climate change a hoax — withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.

Gina McCarthy, former White House National Climate Adviser, called the move ""shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision.""

""As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of U.S. climate change leadership and global collaboration,"" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement. ""This Administration is forfeiting our country's ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies, and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country.""

Mainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.

The U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it ""gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.

It will also be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.

The U.N.'s population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health across the world, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition and Trump himself cut funding for the agency during his first term in office. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in ""coercive abortion practices"" in countries like China.

When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support GOP claims.

Other organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

Congressional forecasters have lowered their projection of population growth over the next decade by 7 million people, in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown as well as falling birth rates.

The U.S. population is now projected to grow from 349 million this year to 357 million in 2035, according to a forecast released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.

That's slower growth than CBO was predicting a year ago. The biggest reason for the downshift is the administration's aggressive effort to cut down on illegal immigration. The U.S. also admitted fewer foreign students in 2025, although the number of authorized green card holders is expected to increase over the next decade.

In addition to slowing immigration, people in the U.S. are having fewer children, which is also putting the brakes on population growth. By 2030, the CBO estimates there will be fewer babies born in the U.S. each year than there are deaths. Absent immigration, the population would begin to shrink at that point.

Immigration also helps to boost birth rates, since foreign-born women have more children, on average, than women born in the U.S.

The demographic outlook helps to shape CBO's annual economic forecast, which will be released next month.

Analysts caution that the long-run forecasts of births, deaths and immigration are uncertain and small changes in any of those factors could significantly change the population over time.

Officials say the woman, a mother of three and a U.S. citizen born in Colorado, was inside her car when she was shot. The confrontation was captured on video, fueling public outcry and leading several city and state leaders to call for ICE to leave Minneapolis.

While Minneapolis deals with its own conflict involving federal immigration authorities, Boston is currently in the middle of a separate legal battle with ICE.

The federal government and the City of Boston are clashing in court over the city’s sanctuary policy — specifically, the Boston Trust Act and whether it interferes with federal immigration enforcement.

In a recent court filing, federal officials allege that Boston’s policy causes local police to “categorically flout” immigration enforcement officers, allowing individuals to “evade ICE apprehension.”

The Boston Trust Act, last amended in 2019, allows Boston police to prioritize criminal law enforcement while leaving civil immigration matters to federal authorities.

The city has argued in court that the policy has contributed to making Boston the safest major city in the country and has asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed.

This case is one of several lawsuits the federal government has filed challenging sanctuary city policies across the U.S.

State and local officials demanded ICE leave the state after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good was shot in the head. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said agents are not going anywhere.

The Department of Homeland Security has deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area in what it says is its largest immigration enforcement operation ever. Noem said more than 1,500 people have been arrested.

Macklin Good's killing Wednesday morning in a residential neighborhood south of downtown was recorded on video by witnesses, and by the evening hundreds of people came out for a vigil to mourn her and urge the public to resist immigration enforcement. Some then chanted as they marched through the city, but there was no violence.

“I would love for ICE to leave our city and for more community members to come to see it happens,” said Sander Kolodziej, a painter who came to the vigil to support the community.

The videos of the shooting show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.

In another recording made afterward, a woman who identifies Macklin Good as her spouse is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who is not identified, says the couple recently arrived in Minnesota and they had a child.

Noem called the incident an “act of domestic terrorism” against ICE officers, saying the driver “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

President Donald Trump made similar accusations on social media and defended ICE’s work.

Noem alleged that the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem’s version of events “garbage.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,” Frey said. “Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

He also criticized the federal deployment and said the agents should leave.

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. Wednesday's is at least the fifth death linked to the crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced the operation’s launch Tuesday, at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A crowd of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting to vent their anger at local and federal officers.

In a scene that hearkened back to crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago, people chanted “ICE out of Minnesota” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He expressed outrage over the shooting but called on people to keep protests peaceful.

“They want a show,” Walz said. “We can’t give it to them.”

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot Macklin Good.

Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

The fight dates back to 2023, when Republicans in the Tennessee General Assembly passed several bills aimed at stripping power from Metro, following the Metro Council’s refusal to support a bid for the Republican National Convention. Several of those laws, especially one taking over the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, have been held up in court for years.

Metro sued the state over the law restricting the council’s size, and in 2024 a three-judge trial court panel ruled that the law breached the state constitution’s Home Rule Amendment.

“This bill was full of extraordinary provisions that were a gross overreach of their constitutional authority,” Dietz said.

But last year, an appellate court panel reversed that decision in a split ruling that said the law did not violate the Home Rule Amendment because it “clearly applies to all counties that have formed or will form a consolidated metropolitan government.” Nashville’s is one of just three metropolitan governments in the state, and it’s the only one with a legislative body made up of more than 20 members.

Judge Kenny Armstrong dissented from the appellate panel decision, pointing out that the state constitution explicitly exempts metropolitan governments from a 25-member cap on the number of seats a local government body can have.

The Tennessee Supreme Court granted Metro’s request for an expedited hearing on the case.

Dietz told the council’s Charter Revision Committee on Wednesday that Metro will file its final brief in the case by Jan. 16, and Supreme Court hearings on both the council and the airport authority cases are expected on Feb. 12. He said the legal department is working on its oral argument, and that there is no specific timeframe for a potential decision to be handed down.

Metro will argue next month that the law violates the Home Rule Amendment and the specific constitutional provision exempting metropolitan governments from a cap on legislative body size. Dietz said Metro would also argue that the entire law is moot because the implementation deadlines in the case passed nearly three years ago.

The Metro Planning Department was already working on new maps reflecting a smaller Metro Council in 2023 before an injunction put the law on hold. That work could pick up speed in the coming months if the council is forced to shrink itself ahead of 2027 Metro elections.

“We think we’re going to win, but if we don’t win we have to be prepared for having an election in 2027 with a vastly different landscape,” Dietz said.

Nashville voters soundly rejected a 2015 charter amendment proposal that would have reduced the Metro Council from 40 members to 27.

“I don’t expect us to lose, but I also think we need to engage the public as quickly as we can,” Councilmember Emily Benedict said.

During legislative deliberation, Sen. Mark Pody (R-Lebanon) was the only Republican senator to vote against the bill. He is the only Republican to represent any part of Nashville in the legislature.

“I hate where the state is reaching down and telling local governments what to do,” he said.

House Majority Leader William Lamberth was a main champion of the bill, alternating between criticizing Nashville governance and claiming that the legislation was about more than just Nashville.

“This isn’t just about Nashville,” Lamberth said. “It’s about every single city in this state not being able to expand and make the mistake Nashville made 50 years ago to have 40 members.”

Sumner County, Lamberth’s home, has a county commission made up of 24 members, plus nearly 50 more councilmembers and commissioners in the county’s municipalities.",https://i0.wp.com/nashvillebanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Metro-Council-Safety-committee-11-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-08 07:56:58.917334

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: That immigrant-detention center in the Everglades has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or re-enter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social-media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-yearolds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers.

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.",http://www.aroundosceola.com/sites/aroundosceola.com/files/2026-01/Legislative-update.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 07:57:17.747495

“I’ll play the tape for you right now,” Mr. Trump said.
Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting.
“Well,” Mr. Trump said.
“I — the way I look at it … ” “It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video.","President Trump wanted to run the tape.

Just hours after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Mr. Trump told a group of New York Times reporters that the woman was at fault because she had tried to “run over” the officer.

We were in the Oval Office for an interview with the president, and the unfolding situation in Minneapolis was high on our list of questions. As soon as we started asking him about the incident, he said: “I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either.”

When we pressed Mr. Trump on his conclusion that the victim, Renee Nicole Good, tried to run over the agent, he asked an aide to pull up the video on a laptop in an effort to prove his point.

“That was a vicious situation that took place,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to what federal officials have said was an effort by Ms. Good to run down an ICE agent.

The exchange was a glimpse into Mr. Trump’s reflexive defense of what has become a sometimes violent federal crackdown on immigration, which in this case claimed the life of an American citizen who was protesting ICE’s presence in Minneapolis.

Speaking at a news conference in Minneapolis, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said that the woman was “stalking” officers, and that the agent who killed her “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.”

But details were in dispute. State and local officials described federal accounts of the shooting with terms like “propaganda” and “garbage.”

Mr. Trump stuck to his position even as we pointed out the inconsistencies and the lack of clarity in videos circulating in social media. We asked if, in his mind, firing into a vehicle like that is acceptable.

“She behaved horribly,” Mr. Trump said. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over.”

We told the president the videos on social media were unclear.

“I’ll play the tape for you right now,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump’s aide Natalie Harp brought a laptop over to the Resolute Desk to show us what he said would be evidence of the woman’s wrongdoing.

Before the video began, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tragic nature of the shooting. “With all of it being said, no, I don’t like that happening,” he said, before pivoting to his common refrain of criticizing illegal immigration.

As a slow-motion surveillance video of the shooting played on the laptop, we told him that this angle did not appear to show an ICE officer had been run over.

“Well,” Mr. Trump said. “I — the way I look at it … ”

“It’s a terrible scene,” Mr. Trump said at the end of the video. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl/08dc-trump-minnesota-bwfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 10:59:39.562828

FEMA terminated dozens of CORE staff late last year, though the agency has said that was a routine part of the agency’s operations.
President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly voiced frustration with FEMA and floated the idea of eliminating it entirely, arguing states should handle their own disaster recovery efforts.
Thompson said FEMA’s workforce should not consider that built up workforce expendable.
“These are the professionals responsible for disaster response, recovery, and preparedness to support Americans when they are at their most vulnerable,” he said.","The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not take any steps to further slash its workforce, the top House Democrat with oversight over the agency said, following reports that the Trump administration is looking to institute reductions.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, called any plans to significantly cut FEMA’s staffing levels ""irresponsible"" and leave the agency incapable of handling upcoming hurricane seasons. His comments followed reporting from several outlets that FEMA has put together plans to eliminate more than 40% of its Cadre of On-Call Response and Recovery (CORE) staff, who make up the bulk of FEMA’s workforce.

FEMA terminated dozens of CORE staff late last year, though the agency has said that was a routine part of the agency’s operations. CORE employees, who quickly deploy after disaster strikes, are hired on two-to-four year terms that can be extended based on the availability of work.

The plans, which were preliminary and not directing any specific action, were first reported by The Washington Post. President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly voiced frustration with FEMA and floated the idea of eliminating it entirely, arguing states should handle their own disaster recovery efforts. For now, Trump has appointed a panel to review the agency’s mission and recommend changes to its structure.

The panel has yet to release its findings and last month canceled a meeting at which it was scheduled to vote on its final report. Noem has taken an unusually direct role in determining which CORE employees can have their contracts renewed, The Post found.

Thompson noted FEMA has already lost 2,000 of its full-time, permanent workforce due to “mismanagement and disastrous policies” and said further would undermine the agency.

“Even considering cuts of this scale is more evidence of the Trump administration’s reckless and dangerous behavior and sends a clear message that the administration is willing to gamble with Americans’ lives and violate federal law that Congress passed to ensure readiness for disasters,” Thompson said.

Trump has yet to nominate a permanent administrator for FEMA, which is currently operating under its third acting head since the president took office. As of June, half of the agency’s Senior Executive Service roles were vacant. The Government Accountability Office recently found FEMA began the 2025 hurricane season with only 12% of its incident management workforce available, a five-year low. Agency officials said they have to scramble to reassign employees when a disaster strikes, taking staff away from ongoing recovery efforts elsewhere.

Former FEMA officials have warned that the staffing cuts, particularly in the leadership ranks, would lead to lost capacity and institutional knowledge.

FEMA for years struggled with ​​insufficient staffing, which was exacerbated by the ever-growing demands of a more intense and frequent disaster season. That continued into the Biden administration as the COVID-19 response and a lack of downtime between deployments led to burnout within the workforce. Toward the end of his presidency, however, FEMA reported making headway in its recruiting efforts—in part due to a legislative reform that made it easier for part-time responders to come and go from the agency—and officials stressed they had the personnel necessary for multiple concurrent crises.

Thompson said FEMA’s workforce should not consider that built up workforce expendable.

“These are the professionals responsible for disaster response, recovery, and preparedness to support Americans when they are at their most vulnerable,” he said. “The Trump administration’s continued efforts to weaken FEMA through drastic staffing reductions undermines public safety and the resilience of the entire country.”

FEMA has stressed the leaked plans do not amount to a mandate to institute cuts and was merely a tool to weigh its options.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/07/010725_Getty_GovExec_FEMAcuts/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 09:58:02.166776

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration raids have targeted New Yorkers in their homes, in their workplaces, in courthouses and even in their schools and places of worship.

These attacks tear entire communities apart, threaten family unity, undermine our core values and harm our economy. As we confront this injustice, we must defend due process and our democratic values by ensuring that anyone facing deportation has legal representation to help them understand their rights in a complex immigration system.

For immigrant New Yorkers facing deportation, having an attorney can mean the difference between being at home with loved ones, contributing at work and thriving in their neighborhoods, or languishing in inhumane conditions in detention and facing permanent separation from their families and communities. These risks are not isolated or rare. Over the past six months, ICE has increasingly detained people who were simply attending immigration court for required appointments or hearings. Attorneys provide critical protection in this hostile environment, helping clients not only to prove their case so that they can remain in the country but also to safely navigate a system that now punishes compliance with the law.

Albany must meet this moment by taking three clear steps to defend due process and our immigrant neighbors.

Invest $175 million in immigration legal defense and social services: Strengthen and expand emergency deportation defense, sustain existing programs, retain experienced staff and invest in long-term infrastructure to ensure that the legal services field remains ready to respond to a changing immigration landscape and provide high-quality services statewide.

Pass the Access to Representation Act (ARA, A270/S141): Establish a right to counsel in immigration court for anyone who can’t afford a lawyer. This would ensure fairer proceedings, as representation significantly increases the likelihood of being granted relief and allows longstanding community members to remain in the country and with their loved ones.

Pass the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act (BUILD Act, A2689/S4538): Invest in the infrastructure needed to make this right a reality. This bill focuses on workforce development to recruit, train and retain immigration attorneys. It also expands services to rural and suburban areas and integrates comprehensive support from social workers and community-based organizations to coordinate client support.

Unleashing an agenda of mass detention and deportations is a devastating and cruel choice by the federal government. New York state must now choose whether we will stand aside and watch or take action by funding the protection our neighbors need to fight back.

Immigrant New Yorkers power this state’s economy and strengthen our communities. New York cannot thrive without them, and we cannot allow them to stand alone. We must be firm in our values and choose representation, due process and dignity for every New Yorker.

How deportation flights work Deportation flights are notoriously difficult to track and have grown even more opaque under the second Trump administration, said Savi Arvey, director of research and analysis at Human Rights First.
That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights.
The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said.
Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025.","Avelo Airlines will end its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and stop deportation flights by Jan. 27, spokesperson Courtney Goff told The Nevada Independent Tuesday.

The budget, Houston-based airline operated the majority of the 124 ICE-chartered flights that stopped at Las Vegas’ Harry Reid International Airport in 2025, according to new data shared exclusively with The Indy by the immigrant- and refugee-focused nonprofit Human Rights First. That’s more than double the 60 ICE-chartered flights that passed through Las Vegas in 2024.

Of last year’s flights, 74, or nearly 3 of 5, were operated by Avelo, which ceased commercial operations in Las Vegas in August.

Goff said Avelo’s ICE contract “provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.”

It is unclear why deportation flights stop in Nevada and if the planes pick up detainees held in detention centers in the state. ICE discloses little information about the flights’ passengers or paths, multiple immigration experts told The Indy.

ICE representatives did not respond to requests for comment from The Indy.

Federal immigration authorities use the flights to transfer detainees between detention centers and major deportation facilities and to deport detainees.

Some detainees are placed on multiple domestic flights before being sent to deportation facilities in a process Human Rights First refers to as the domestic “shuffle.”

The Obama and Biden administrations also shuffled detainees around the country, but the pace of such flights has increased dramatically under the Trump administration. The ICE Flight Monitor counted more than 7,300 domestic shuffle flights between Jan. 20 and Nov. 30, 2025, a 114 percent increase compared with the number of shuffle flights during the same period in 2024.

The Los Angeles Times reported in September 2025 that detainees were being transferred at much higher rates under the second Trump administration than under Biden, with twice as many detainees being transferred at least four times compared with in 2024.

How deportation flights work

Deportation flights are notoriously difficult to track and have grown even more opaque under the second Trump administration, said Savi Arvey, director of research and analysis at Human Rights First.

The nonprofit tracks the flights through its ICE Flight Monitor using publicly available aviation data, according to its website.

Arvey told The Indy that while the Biden administration also kept data on deportation flights secret, it was generally more forthcoming when detainees were removed to foreign countries.

ICE contracts its air operations through the company CSI Aviation, which in turn subcontracts operations to 10 airline carriers. Although federal immigration agents are usually onboard, flights are primarily staffed by the airlines’ civilian crews.

At least some of the airlines with ICE contracts, including Avelo, have removed their logos from aircraft used to transport detainees, leaving only tail numbers as identification. The airlines have also utilized a federal aviation law that allows them to block certain planes from appearing on flight tracking websites.

That leaves only a handful of resources available to track ICE flights. Human Rights First’s flight monitor relies on a “very complex process that took us a long time to learn,” said Arvey.

Beyond the lack of public transparency over flight patterns, immigration experts told The Indy that detainees often have no idea where they are going and whether they are being sent to another domestic facility or being permanently deported.

“This can make people terrified,” said Michael Kagan, a UNLV professor who directs the university’s immigration law clinic. “ICE moves people with no warning. Lawyers aren’t told. Family isn’t told. … They’ll even sometimes reverse the move and bring people back to the first detention center with no explanation.”

Kagan also said ICE fails to regularly update its detainee locator.

Relocations make it harder for detainees to secure adequate legal representation, Kagan said. Sometimes detainees are transferred out of state before lawyers can complete their intake requirements, he said, and some states have residency requirements for legal filings that make it impossible for detainees to secure consistent representation.

“It’s definitely not what you would do if you wanted fair procedures and to make sure the law is applied correctly,” he said.

Lucas Guttentag, a professor at Stanford Law School who tracks federal immigration policy, told The Indy he believes the increase in domestic transfers is part of “the public spectacle and private terror of the Trump administration’s actions.”

The purpose of domestic shuffles, he argued, “is to frighten people about enforcement actions.”

Last year, both ProPublica and The American Prospect reported on allegations by multiple flight attendants of inadequate security and safety measures on ICE-chartered flights, including federal agents forcing detainees to remain handcuffed while in the air and failing to check detainees’ luggage before takeoff.

Airports also have little information about or control over deportation flights.

Harry Reid International Airport spokesperson Monika Bertaki told The Indy that they do not receive advance notice of ICE-chartered flights and do not receive information on passengers onboard. “Armed federal agents that are on airport property” do trigger additional security measures, she said.

The deportation flights are organized by two aeronautical service companies that have contracts with Harry Reid, Bertaki said. Neither of those companies responded to The Indy’s requests for comment.

Of ICE’s partner airlines, Avelo is sole commercial operation

In May 2025, Avelo announced it had agreed to operate deportation flights, becoming the first — and so far only — commercial airline to sign an ICE contract. The agency’s other contracts are with charter airlines.

Avelo ranked third last year for its number of deportation flights, operating more than 1,700 of the flights through November 2025. Avelo-owned planes made their first immigration-related stops in Las Vegas in May 2025.

For a number of months last year, it was the only ICE-contracted airline that made stops in Las Vegas.

The Avelo-ICE contract was criticized by Democrats nationwide, some of whom introduced legislation aiming to cut Avelo’s public funding. Critics also organized protests in or near airports to lobby against the Avelo contract and signed online pledges to boycott the company.

But Goff, the Avelo spokesperson, denied such actions were part of Avelo’s decision.

“We did not see an impact in regard to customers choosing to fly,” Goff wrote. “It was a commercial decision.”

In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil on Wednesday, Homan watched a video of the deadly incident but declined to comment on what he saw.

Instead, he claimed that members of Congress have called the incident ""murder,"" which he said will only incite ""more violence, more threats and hopefully not more bloodshed"" against ICE employees.

Homan did not name any lawmakers, though a handful of House Democrats referred to the killing as a murder in social media posts throughout the day. Most lawmakers who condemned the incident did not call it a murder in their public statements.

""I'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation,"" Homan said, before pivoting to chastise those who have criticized ICE. ""The comments about murder [are] going to incite … more violence, more threats and hopefully not more bloodshed.""

Witnesses and videos dispute the agency's narrative.

In recent days, the Trump administration began a massive deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as part of an expanded immigration crackdown.

When asked by CBS News if he has ever seen an example of excessive force, Homan blamed public anger toward the agency on ""false media reporting"" and ""hateful rhetoric"" pushed by some public officials.

The woman shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent during a federal operation in the US state of Minnesota has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Good was fatally shot on Wednesday, Jan. 7, just blocks from her home, where she lived with her partner and three children, according to media reports.

Speaking to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, said that family members were notified of her death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid,” Ganger said after learning details of the shooting, adding: “She was probably terrified.”

Ganger said that her daughter was not involved in any protest directed at ICE agents, adding: “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known.”

""She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

An Instagram account appearing to belong to Good describes her as a poet, writer, wife and mother living in Minneapolis. She previously studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia, where she won the school’s undergraduate poetry prize in 2020.

University President Brian O. Hemphill, in a statement, said Good graduated from the school in 2020 with an English degree, calling her killing ""yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.""

""May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,"" Hemphill said, adding: ""My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.”

Good was previously married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., who died in 2023, according to the Tribune. His father, Timmy Ray Macklin Sr., said the couple shared a 6-year-old child. “There’s nobody else in his life,” Macklin said. “I’ll drive. I’ll fly. To come and get my grandchild.”

Hundreds gathered Wednesday evening for a vigil near Good’s home, chanting her name as they walked through the neighborhood. Speakers described her as a peaceful neighbor who acted out of care for others.

Neighbors described Good as warm and attentive, often outside with her young son. “It’s a beautiful family,” Mary Radford, who lived next door, told the newspaper. “We’re gonna miss seeing them -- forever.”

Good’s shooting

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed that Good, 37, attempted to hit officers with her vehicle, prompting an agent to fire in what officials described as an act of ""self-defense.""

Local officials disputed that account, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying he reviewed video footage of the shooting and rejected claims that it was justified, calling it a reckless use of force. He demanded that the federal immigration agents leave the city.

Releasing a joint statement on the incident, the Minneapolis City Council said Good was a resident whose “life was taken today at the hands of the federal government.”

“Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” said the council, demanding ICE “immediately leave our city so we can get rid of their chaos and violence that ended the life of one of our neighbors today.”

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on the US social media company X that ICE officers were conducting targeted operations when ""rioters"" began blocking them and ""one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle.""

An ICE officer ""used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said, adding that officers injured in the incident were expected to make full recoveries.

But Gov. Tim Walz echoed the mayor's view, calling the Department of Homeland Security's account of the incident the product of ""propaganda.""

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,"" he wrote on X.

Frey said he was aware of the shooting, while accusing federal immigration enforcement agents of causing ""chaos"" in Minneapolis.

The three main cable networks’ on-screen graphics framed the incident slightly differently. Fox News referred to it as a “Deadly ICE-involved Shooting”, while CNN said more plainly: “ICE Officer Kills Woman in Minneapolis.”

The progressive network MS NOW – formerly MSNBC – also characterized the incident in part as “Agent Kills Woman” in an on-screen graphic.

Both CNN and Fox News brought on former officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide analysis based on their government experience, though their conclusions differed.

John Sandweg, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the Obama administration, questioned whether the federal agents had been properly trained and vetted.

“My immediate concern is this: to what extent has this rushing of hiring of people – this shortcutting on our trainin g – to what extent might that have informed what happened here,” he said on CNN.

Chad Wolf, the former acting United States secretary of homeland security, appeared on Fox News and criticized Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, for his comments during a press conference, when he told ICE to “get the fuck out of” the city.

“The mayor’s comments were probably some of the most unintelligible, unhinged comments I think I’ve heard in quite some time,” Wolf said, accusing Frey of having unfairly blamed the federal agents while laying “no blame at all on the individuals that are impeding law enforcement”.

“If you get in their way, and you don’t take their commands, well then that’s against the law,” Wolf added.

Paul Mauro, a Fox News contributor and former inspector in the New York City police department, also seemed to put blame on the protesters, saying many “really want confrontation” and document ICE actions using cellphone video “to get social media clicks”.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham said the incident is “the legacy of the normalization of violence and disrespect toward law enforcement that was legitimized and in many ways celebrated – mostly by the Democrats, far-left agitators, for years”.

But network personalities and guests were not unified in their perspective on the incident.

Jessica Tarlov, a prominent left-leaning voice on Fox News, shared a video of the shooting on X and called it “horrific”. “A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman,” she said.

On MS NOW, former chief of the US Capitol police Tom Manger also criticized the remarks by Frey, the Minneapolis mayor. “When elected officials get out in front of an investigation and give you their conclusions, I don’t know how helpful that is,” he said.

Witnesses say the woman was a legal observer who was trying to drive away from agents when she was shot. News surrounding the fatal shooting is still unfolding.

“To ICE, get the f-ck out of Minneapolis,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during an afternoon press conference following the shooting. Frey was adamant in his demands that immigration agents leave the city immediately.

“Do not let them tell you that what they are doing is about creating safety,” Frey said. “They need to leave Minneapolis.”

Jon Collins, a reporter with MPR News, is reporting that tensions are high at the scene. There are about 200 people at the scene. Local officials are pushing for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) in Minneapolis to take over the investigation because they don’t trust federal agents.

Reporters and witnesses have also shared to Bluesky photos of Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino at the scene. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security writes that the ICE agent, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Frey said he’s watched a video of the incident. “They [DHS] are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit,” he said.

In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois during the feds’ enforcement surge in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Unraveled Press were the first to report that the initial narrative of events from the Department of Homeland Security was quickly disproven by videos captured by witnesses.

Bovino and his team of federal agents have carried out immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, and in his home state of North Carolina — with Charlotte being the city specifically targeted by agents. More federal operations have taken place in Louisiana and in Minnesota.

1:35 p.m.

WARNING — Graphic video and details from the scene.

Phil Lewis, deputy editor at the Huffington Post, shared witness video of the incident on social media. He said the witness originally shared the video with the Minnesota Reformer.

The video begins with agents getting out of a pickup truck and walking over to a Honda SUV. Multiple agents surround the SUV. As one masked agent tries to open the driver’s side door of the SUV, the driver of the SUV backs up. A woman’s voice behind the video camera can be heard screaming “no.”

Another agent appears from the front of the SUV, reaching for his waistband. As the driver of the SUV pulls forward, the agent points his gun at the driver and fires multiple shots. The woman’s voice behind the camera can be heard screaming, “oh my f-cking God!”

The SUV veers off, crashing into parked cars on the street. The woman behind the camera screams, “what the f-ck did you do?!”

Agents rush over to the crashed SUV. Witnesses also walk towards the SUV with their cellphone cameras in hand. The video shows some graphic images of the scene before agents begin to cordon off the area.

2:50 p.m.

“I want Minnesotans to hear this from me. The desire to get out of the protest and to speak up to this administration [about] how wrong this is, that is a patriotic duty,” Walz told reporters, adding that civil unrest must be done peacefully.

Walz said the Minnesota National Guard is on standby.

“They’re there to protect you and protect your constitutional rights. These are our neighbors. They don’t wear masks,” Walz said about the Minnesota National Guard. He said the guard members are not bussed in from somewhere else.

He added that the National Guard would protect people and protect in the event that disruptors want to be destructive, as Minneapolis experienced during the civil unrest following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.

2:55 p.m.

Walz told reporters if he activates the Minnesota National Guard, he would do so under an executive order, “and then they will be put in state duty status.”

Walz told Minnesotans do not give the Trump administration a reason to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in federal troops into Minneapolis. He asked rhetorically, “is this the McCarthy moment?”

“We have a chaotic situation caused by the largest deployment in American history of federal agents into a community with no communication to locals. We had a chaotic situation where an individual is in their car, shot and killed,” Walz said.

He continued, “I want to be very cautious here, because Donald Trump will make this about me. He will make this about politics. This is about public safety, and this about normalcy. To Americans who are watching this, if you’re in Portland or you’re in LA, or you’re in Chicago, or you are wherever they’re coming next, stand with us.

Dueling narratives emerged over what led to the shooting. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed the woman “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on DHS’s narrative in a press conference Wednesday afternoon, saying, “they are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,” referring to ICE. “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is b---s---.”

Witnesses described seeing the woman in the vehicle trying to flee officers when she was shot, disputing the notion that she was attempting to run officers over. Police described the deceased as a “middle-aged white woman” who did not appear to be the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.

Immigration enforcement officers were conducting targeted operations in Minneapolis when the shooting happened, but it’s unclear what operation ICE was conducting in that particular neighborhood.

U.S. & World

Stories that affect your life across the U.S. and around the world.

Several video clips of the incident emerged on social media.

In one video, a gray pick-up truck is seen pulling up to a burgundy SUV stopped perpendicular to the truck as someone shouts “get the f— out of our neighborhood.” Agents get out of the truck, and one walks up to the SUV and yanks on the driver’s door handle, ordering the driver to get out. The vehicle reverses.

Another agent is standing near the front of the SUV as it pulls forward. The agent appears to draw his firearm and as the SUV drives forward in his direction he moves backward, shooting into the SUV as it drives off, the video shows.

In another video showing a different angle of the scene, the agent appears to be knocked back as the SUV drives forward before crashing into a parked car and hitting a light pole. President Donald Trump attached the video clip showing this angle to a post on Truth Social, saying the woman driving was “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting,” and that it was hard to believe the agent survived the incident.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference Wednesday evening that the ICE agent was ""hit by the vehicle"" driven by the woman who was shot. He went to the hospital and was released, she said.

Noem said the officer, whom officials have not yet identified, had been attacked before while on the job.

“The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time as well,” she said.

Noem said at a press conference earlier in the day that the agents’ vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman “attacked them.”

“It was an act of domestic terrorism,” she said, without providing further evidence.

At the mayor's news conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara expressed concern about the tactics used by ICE agents.

“I do not know the exact circumstances of the shooting, but I would tell you, in any professional law enforcement agency in the country ... it’s obviously very concerning whenever there’s a shooting into a vehicle of someone who’s not armed,” he said, noting that at times it could be justified, but that “most law enforcement agencies in the country have trained very intensely to try and minimize the risk” of using deadly force.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he witnessed the incident and it didn’t look like the woman was trying to run over an agent.

“I heard that Noem is trying to say they were trying to run down an officer. There was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through,” he told NBC News, adding that it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

Emily Heller, 39, wasn’t even dressed when she heard whistles alerting the neighborhood that ICE agents were in the area this morning. When she walked out to her porch she said she saw six or seven ICE vehicles and a person who had parked perpendicular to traffic.

Heller said she saw agents exit their cars and tell the driver to leave, to “get out of here.”

“And then they went up to her car and started trying to open her door, and that’s when I’m sure she got spooked and tried to flee,” Heller said. “So she reversed a little bit and then angled her wheels so she could drive away. And as she was trying to move forward, one of the ICE agents stepped in front of her vehicle and reached across the hood and fired his weapon about three or four times and shot her in the face.”

Aidan’s wife Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood two and a half years and “we love it.”

“We are really happy here. We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue,” she said. “There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards.”

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

DHS stepping up immigration enforcement

Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The push has ramped up tensions with local officials in some cities and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts.

In September, in the Chicago area, an ICE agent fatally shot a man during a traffic stop. His family called for justice and local police said the FBI had been investigating the death.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said. That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12.

DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon following the shooting, mayor Frey told ICE agents to ""get the f--- out of Minneapolis.""

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday’s shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2026/01/MINN-SHOOTING-ICE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-08 02:57:24.590002

MINNEAPOLIS (OSV News) ─ Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda is continuing his call for prayers after police said a woman was pronounced dead following a shooting involving a federal agent in Minneapolis Jan. 7.

""Following this morning's deadly shooting in Minneapolis, I reiterate my plea for all people of good will to join me in prayer for the person who was killed, for their loved ones, and for our community,"" Archbishop Hebda, head of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, said in a statement following the incident, referring back to his request for prayers on Dec. 23 as immigration enforcement efforts in the Twin Cities drew concerns from some about attending Christmas Masses.

The incident Jan. 7 occurred in the area of 34th Street and Portland Avenue, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.

The woman shot by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been identified by Minnesota media as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet originally from Colorado.

During a news conference, O'Hara said police responded to the area after receiving a report of a federal law enforcement officer being involved in a deadly force incident, ""meaning shots had been fired.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security indicated on social media that ""ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations"" Jan. 7.

Upon arrival, O'Hara said officers found a woman who had suffered a gunshot wound to the head. O'Hara said CPR and other life-saving measures were administered and the woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

O'Hara said a preliminary investigation into the incident indicated the woman ""was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue, midway between 33rd Street and 34th Street in the city.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her, on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway,"" O'Hara said.

O'Hara said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are among the agencies investigating the incident.

""This has been a very difficult time for everyone in the city and this is obviously a very, very tragic situation where a woman has lost her life,"" O'Hara said.

""We've dreaded this moment since the early stages of this ICE presence in Minneapolis,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during his remarks at the news conference.

""We ask that the community continue to call for peace,"" O'Hara said. Frey agreed. ""Let's unite around hope and love and peace and getting justice, that's what we need to be doing right now,"" Frey said.

Archbishop Hebda in his statement appealed for all people ""to lower the temperature of rhetoric, stop fear-filled speculation and start seeing all people as created in the image and likeness of God.""

He said, ""That is as true for our immigrant sisters and brothers as it is for our elected officials and those who are responsible for enforcing our laws.""

Archbishop Hebda also said he wanted to ""echo today the repeated call of the U.S. Catholic bishops that we come together as a nation and pass meaningful immigration reform that does justice to all parties.""

He indicated that the issue is becoming ""more divisive and violent"" the longer the country refuses to grapple with it.

""It is only by working together -- with God's help -- that we will have peace in our communities, state and world,"" he said.",https://img.hghlnd.com/imgix/https://detroitcatholic.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/1152844/20260107T1647-MPLS-ICE-DEADLY-SHOOTING-1810807.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 01:56:27.558299

Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.
He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate.
“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.
Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies.","WASHINGTON – The margin for error for Republicans in Congress was slim before the unexpected death Tuesday of Doug LaMalfa, a conservative rice farmer from northern California: 220 to 213.

Along with the resignation Monday of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former supporter of President Trump who held a Georgia seat, LaMalfa’s death means House Republicans can lose two votes on a given bill and still pass it. “It’s not a big majority,” Trump said when asked about LaMalfa’s death. “But it’s a unified majority, and it’s people that know what it takes to make America great again.”

There are four vacancies in the House, including the former seat of Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey’s governor elect.

Facing a challenging mid-term election period this November – the president’s party on average loses 28 seats in the House of Representatives – Trump and Republicans in Congress, who hold control of both the House and Senate, show no signs of breaking from the swaggering governance style they embodied in 2025, both state-side and abroad.

“Nobody can take us. Nobody,” Trump said Tuesday, days after ordering a military raid to seize Venezuelan president Nicholás Maduro.

Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.

Backed with an immense public following, the commander in chief trained his ire against Democratic-leaning states, like New Jersey, where his administration canceled offshore wind projects, targeted climate grants, threatened transit projects and moved to jail Democratic officials. In the fall, after a group of lawmakers urged U.S. troops to disobey unlawful commands, Trump called their actions “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”

Domestically, Trump and his political allies punished critics, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th), the target of a federal prosecution in Newark, and a New York senator over the Gateway train-and-tunnel project. He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate. He refused to rule out a third term in the White House, something the U.S. Constitution bans. He and budget officials repeatedly broke the law, according to non-partisan watchdog groups, including by cancelling public-health grants. And he has surrounded himself with the trappings of a king: a military parade in the summer on his birthday, the bulldozing of the White House’s East Wing for a ballroom in his name and banners of his face on federal buildings.

“It’s just been so chaotic,” McIver said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “I never thought a bunch of grown people would not be able to work together for the betterment of the millions of people we serve.”

Workers in December hammered new letters, adding Trump’s name, into the facade of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in Washington – an act that drew legal challenges in federal court.

Though Trump campaigned in 2024 as a populist promising to lower costs for the average American, his signature bill Congress passed into law will benefit the rich and hurt the poor, according to economic analysts.

“This is a reverse Robin Hood,” Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at the think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “It is taking money from people who need it the most and giving it to people who need it the least.”

The wealthiest 10% of households will get an average of $13,600 in benefits annually because of the new law, while those in the lowest 10% of the economic system will lose roughly $1,200 each year.

At the same time, that law will remove about 400,000 people in New Jersey from the U.S.’s largest anti-hunger system, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides benefits of $6 a day on average.

Historically, states have not paid the costs to implement SNAP – something the new law changed. And New Jersey is in a small category of states that may be required to pay extra, under language Republicans included during the marathon summer negotiations on the bill.

State legislators in Trenton and Sherrill, a former Democratic House member and the incoming governor, are bracing for the impact the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, the federal health insurance system for the low-income and disabled, will deliver to the New Jersey state budget.

The state’s Department of Human Services estimates as many as 350,000 people in New Jersey could lose insurance directly due the law, and that, depending on how federal medical taxes are implemented, state hospitals could lose $2.8 billion.

“I think it’s probably fair to say this is the most significant federal legislation affecting Medicaid since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,” Greg Woods, assistant commissioner at the department, said after passage.

When they wrote the law, Republicans in Congress front-loaded tax breaks for people and held off cuts to these food and health programs, a strategy that may shield their party at the ballot box in November.

“The mindset was just to get people really used to it, to get the states used to having to be more efficient and for the system to work better,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd).

On the environment, Trump and his fellow Republicans in Washington have rescinded or watered down much of the Biden administration’s environmental legacy.

Beyond phasing out tax credits for renewable energy, such as a popular incentive for rooftop solar power, the Trump administration moved to eliminate the legal justification that allows the U.S. to regulate greenhouse gases altogether.

While Congress made sweeping changes to the economy through the Republican tax law, the Trump administration made policy changes that will touch the lives of regular people. It ended a federal program that allowed people to file their taxes for free. It undid a rule that would have limited overdraft banking fees to $5. And it threatened the future of the Gateway project, a lifeline for passenger and freight rail in the Northeast.

“The first thing that comes to mind is Trump’s decision with respect to the Gateway tunnel,” Rep. Nellie Pou (D-9th), reflecting Trump’s second term so far, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “That’s a huge, monumental problem for us.”

During his first term, Trump threatened to launch a barrage of tariffs – taxes on imported goods, passed on to the public. But his economic advisors generally talked him out of it. That was not the case in 2025.

Last year, in an effort to take back wealth “stolen” from the U.S., Trump, who as president can unilaterally impose or end tariffs, issued a barrage of tariffs on countries worldwide that cost the average U.S. household $1,200, according to research Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee, an arm of Congress, released last year.

“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. The tariffs and rising health care costs, after Congress declined to extend subsidies for the 2010 health law known as Obamacare, dominated last year, Gottheimer said.

“There’s nothing that hasn’t been impacted by that,” he said of Trump’s tariff agenda.

Premiums for New Jersey patients covered in the 2010 law will rise an average of 15.9% this year, from 2025 prices, according to state officials. Members of Congress are trying to find a way to extend the subsidies for the health law, a path to passage is hazy.

Perhaps the most striking changes with Trump back in Washington for New Jersey, where about 25% percent of residents were born in another country, came on immigration policy.

The administration moved hundreds of thousands of people through the federal immigration detention system last year and shows no signs of stopping.

The White House is eyeing Roxbury Township in Morris County for a possible new detention center, in addition to the use of a military base in South Jersey to hold then deport immigrants.

Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies. “We can’t let them forget that we did such a great job on the border.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/11/donald-trump-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:56:58.255308

Operation Metro Surge began in the city in December, but escalated a few days ago with an influx of federal agents to Minneapolis neighbourhoods.
Minneapolis is a sanctuary city, which means the local authorities do little to enforce federal immigration laws.
Some of the other claims coming from federal authorities include that the victim tried to run over ICE agents and that the officers acted defensively.
""The residents putting their personal safety on the line to observe ICE agents and their activities are keeping us safe.","The city of Minneapolis had been preparing for a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as Donald Trump's blitz on Democratic strongholds rolled out across the country.

Operation Metro Surge began in the city in December, but escalated a few days ago with an influx of federal agents to Minneapolis neighbourhoods.

Like in Los Angeles and Washington DC, ordinary citizens and local organisers have formed networks of those who want ICE gone and who are wiling to help.

They patrol the streets too, warning neighbourhoods of incoming ICE raids, documenting what happens and sometimes offering legal advice to those targeted.

Now, a US citizen has been fatally shot by an ICE agent, and according to a local council member and the area's congressional representative, that person was one of the legal observers, who usually operate in a volunteer capacity.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, has been identified as the victim.

Local councillor and an organiser of these civilian resistance networks Jason Chavez said Ms Good was ""out in our community because of the care and love"" for immigrant neighbours.

""We have a variety of community responders on the ground watching ICE agents, helping families with rent, food, watching our neighbourhoods, making sure that we can keep our neighbourhoods safe and make sure that immigration enforcement isn't splitting our families apart,"" he told local media.

""Making sure that they can alert and blow a whistle whenever ICE is near so their neighbours know what is happening.""

Minneapolis is a sanctuary city, which means the local authorities do little to enforce federal immigration laws. Los Angeles, New York and Chicago are also sanctuary cities.

Local media is reporting that for nearly a year, migrant rights and neighbourhood advocates and activists across the Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and the neighbouring St Paul are known, have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge.

From places of worship to caravan parks, these organisers have set up very active online networks.

They reportedly scan licence plates to identify possible federal vehicles, and hand out whistles to sound a warning of any enforcement presence.

They are connected in chat groups, have code names and two-way radios and use their own cars. Some have legal training, others volunteer their time, effort and smartphones to document what they see in case it might be of legal significance down the line.

In blue cities, when federal agents sent by Donald Trump's administration are on the streets, there will very likely be someone from one of these networks around the corner, too.

In August, the ABC spent an evening inside one of these networks in operation in and around Washington DC as National Guard troops and federal agents patrolled the city.

'We are trying to get there as quickly as possible'

With her car and her phone, Anna, who asked for her real name not to be used, was dedicating several weeknights to patrol the streets of Washington DC, just as National Troops and several federal agencies were.

She worked as a full-time teacher outside the nation's capital during the day, then made her way into the city come nightfall.

""Sometimes maybe 2 hours will go by and nothing will happen and we're just sitting around and we're watching and we're waiting and then sometimes we will realise 40, 50 … police officers are being called to the scene of a simple fight,"" she told the ABC in August when Washington DC was the focus of Donald Trump's crackdown.

""And we're wondering why so many cops are being called to one area.

""So we're basically just trying to go around and get footage and ask questions about everything that's happening because it all feels very performative.

""It feels that this is all supposed to be a big display of a show of force even for things that normally would be a much smaller situation or offence, so we're just trying to get that on film and ask questions and do our due diligence.""

In August, the ABC witnessed Anna and others as they received tip-offs about where law enforcement was suspected to be active that night. In a convoy, they'd travel to that location and start filming.

She said, ""details and context are incredibly important"".

""We need to be vigilant about what the story actually is. We are trying to get there as quickly as possible to see exactly what happened,"" she said.

""It's a community and we're all giving pieces of detail, that are all part of the big puzzle that's being put together that makes it more informative for the entire public. We're all trying to piece the picture together,"" she said.

""We're all trying to help and make it so we know what's going on in our city and our communities.""

In Minneapolis, there are competing narratives about what happened in the lead-up to the death of Ms Good.

Donald Trump claims the victim was a ""professional agitator"". Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X that the ICE officer began firing after a ""violent rioter"".

Some of the other claims coming from federal authorities include that the victim tried to run over ICE agents and that the officers acted defensively.

But with so many people present at the scene of the enforcement activity, there are several videos of the incident taken from multiple angles that will allow the world and any potential investigators to see and judge the shooting for themselves.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has been scathing, saying: ""They're already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence… having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly — that is bullshit.""

The fatal shooting happened just blocks from where an officer of the Minneapolis Police Department murdered black man George Floyd in May 2020.

Observing ICE actions 'not a crime'

Local councillor Chavez had been putting a call-out on his Facebook page for several days ahead of the shooting, asking community members to join the observer networks.

Since the shooting, he has posted several times saying: ""Observing the federal government's actions at 34th and Portland is not a crime, and even if it were, it would not be punishable by death.""

""The deceased should be with us today, but because these masked agents believe they are above the law, [the victim was] murdered for exercising their rights.

""The residents putting their personal safety on the line to observe ICE agents and their activities are keeping us safe. They're documenting the government's criminal activities, driving our friends and family to work or school, and they're providing mutual aid.""

Democratic congressional representative for Minnesota Ilhan Omar said: ""For weeks, ICE's so-called 'Operation Metro Surge' has spread fear, chaos and violence across our state.""

""ICE's actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible. I am beyond outraged that their reckless, callous actions led to the killing of a legal observer in Minneapolis,"" she said.

Just two days ago, the White House issued an update on Operation Metro Surge, saying: ""The streets of Minneapolis are safer today thanks to the hard work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and their federal partners.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0a9d2f5dd9984dd543467764df7d1e39?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1774&cropW=3153&xPos=0&yPos=164&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-08 02:57:28.714657

... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.
People protest as law enforcement officers attend to the scene of the shooting involving federal law enforcement agents, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis.
The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly.","Court records show that Renee Nicole Macklin Good had previously been married to a man named Timmy Ray Macklin, who died in 2023 at age 36.

The man’s father, Timmy Ray Macklin Sr., told the Minnesota Star Tribune that his son and Macklin Good had a child together who is now 6 years old.

“There’s nobody else in his life,” Macklin Sr. told the paper.

Donna Ganger, the deceased woman’s mother, told the newspaper that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid” that she was killed, Ganger told the newspaper. “She was probably terrified.”

Asked about protesters challenging ICE officers, Ganger said her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all.”

A hospital record obtained by The Associated Press identified the woman as 37-year-old Renae Macklin-Good, though business records spelled her name as Renee Nicole Macklin Good.

In social media accounts, Macklin Good said she was a “Poet and writer and wife and mom” originally from Colorado but “experiencing Minnesota.” A profile picture shows her smiling and holding a young child against her cheek.

In a video from the scene of the shooting posted to social media, a distraught woman is seen sitting near the vehicle crying, describing Macklin Good as her spouse and that they had a 6-year-old child.

“That’s my wife, I don’t know what to do!” wailed the woman, who wasn’t identified.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening.

Noem alleged that the woman who was killed was trying to block officers with her vehicle, had been harassing them through the day and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over” before she was shot.

“We’ll let the FBI continue the investigation to get it resolved,” she said, adding that the officer was hit by the vehicle, taken to a hospital and released.

Noem added that immigration enforcement has made over 1,500 arrests in Minnesota in recent weeks.

Black Visions, a Black Lives Matter-affiliated group in Minneapolis, said the killing was “the outcome of escalating state violence fueled by raids, fear, and the criminalization of immigrant life.”

“Our communities have been sounding the alarm, and today that violence turned deadly,” reads a statement posted to a Facebook account for the group, which was involved in organizing protests after the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.

“We will not normalize this violence,” it continued. “Our greatest resistance has always been our love and care for one another. They cannot defeat us.”

The Rev. Ingrid Rasmussen, a pastor of nearby Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, said she and other clergy, wearing their stoles and collars, are there “to be in community with a neighborhood that’s hurting and a city that feels under siege.”

Rasmussen, who had opened her church to the community during the protests and rioting after the killing of George Floyd, said she hoped violence wouldn’t happen again, but blamed federal law enforcement activities like Wednesday’s shooting for inciting it.

“We are all gathered around our own grief,” she said.

Lynette Reini-Grandell, 65, had already heard that ICE agents were in her neighborhood when she saw the chaotic scene, one car askew in a lane and ICE vehicles backed up behind it.

She said she tried to figure out what was going on when several gunshots rang out and the car that was askew crashed to a stop.

“She was driving away and they killed her,” said Reini-Grandell of the motorist.

Reini-Grandell said she started recording ICE officers approach the woman’s vehicle and kept a close watch as law enforcement told bystanders to stand back.

“I didn’t want to get shot or chemical sprayed,” she said. “I was much calmer when it was happening than I am now.”

The Department of Justice says in its Justice Manual that firearms should not be used simply to disable a moving vehicle.

The policy allows deadly force only in limited circumstances, such as when someone in the vehicle is threatening another person with deadly force, or when the vehicle itself is being used in a way that poses an imminent risk and no reasonable alternative exists, including moving out of the vehicle’s path.

Police training experts have told The Associated Press that officers are generally taught not to step in front of moving vehicles to try to block them.

Training also emphasizes weighing the totality of the situation, including whether the person involved poses an immediate danger and whether the underlying allegation involves violence.

Many department policies specifically bar firing at vehicles just to stop a fleeing suspect.

Some policing experts say the rules need flexibility, pointing to cases in which people have used vehicles as weapons, including attacks in recent years where cars were driven into crowds.

The debate has been sharpened by high-profile cases, including a 2023 shooting in Ohio in which an officer fired through a windshield in a grocery store parking lot while investigating a shoplifting allegation, killing the pregnant motorist. The officer was later charged and acquitted.

For decades, police departments across the U.S. have limited when officers are allowed to fire at moving vehicles, citing the danger to bystanders and the risk that a driver who is shot will lose control.

The New York Police Department was among the first major agencies to adopt those limits. The department barred officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car and sparked protests.

Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s later found that the policy, along with other use-of-force restrictions, helped reduce bystanders being struck by police gunfire and led to fewer deaths in police shootings.

Over the years, many law enforcement agencies followed New York’s lead. Policing organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended similar limits, warning that shooting at vehicles creates serious risks from stray gunfire or from a vehicle crashing if the driver is hit.

Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O’Hara didn’t say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.

“At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

The governor said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He also said that like many, he is outraged about the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” But he called for calm.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference.

“If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”

The president, in a social media post, said he’d viewed video footage of the incident and criticized the woman who was shot as acting “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and “then violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer.

The president also described another woman seen screaming in the footage of the incident he viewed as “obviously, a professional agitator.”

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said of the ICE officer.

“The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.”

In October, a Chicago woman was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in a similar incident involving a vehicle, though she survived.

Almost immediately, Homeland Security officials issued a statement labeling Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, as a “domestic terrorist” who had “ambushed” and “rammed” agents with her vehicle.

She was charged in federal court with assaulting a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

But federal prosecutors were later forced to dismiss the case against Martinez before trial after security camera video and body cam footage emerged that her defense lawyers said undermined the official narrative.

The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez’s truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said.

Text messages showed the federal agent bragging about his marksmanship after the shooting.

“I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes,” read a text message that the agent, Charles Exum, sent to colleagues. “Put that in your book boys.” Twenty-four hours after the shooting, Exum texted, “Cool, I’m up for another round.”

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine,” Walz wrote on X, responding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s post alleging that a woman had “weaponized her vehicle” before she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” wrote the governor.

Major protests and rioting erupted in 2020 after Floyd’s death, damaging many businesses that have struggled to recover.

Public safety in the area has long been under scrutiny as well — most recently in November, when a Minneapolis city council member, Jamal Osman, parked just a couple of blocks away from the area, was robbed and his vehicle stolen by suspects he was told had carjacked another person earlier that evening.

Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, says it was carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Mayor Frey blasted that characterization as well as the federal deployment in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said.

The location is just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

The crowd vented its anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that harkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago immigration crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

That’s according to a statement from department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A federal officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist when she allegedly tried to run over law enforcement officers during an immigration crackdown in the city, authorities said Wednesday.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly. Fry rejected federal officials’ claims that the officer had acted in self-defense.

During a news conference hours after the ICE officer shot the woman, whose name hasn’t been released, an angry Frey blasted the federal immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets and in this case quite literally killing people.”

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the city’s oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her death quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor added.

Videos taken by bystanders from different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the SUV moves towards him.

It was not clear from the videos whether the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked at the kerb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they had seen.

After the shooting, emergency medical technicians attempted to administer aid to the woman.

The killing marked a dramatic escalation in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the Minneapolis driver, whose name was not immediately released, was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since the Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who fired the shots. Bob Jacobson, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said state authorities would investigate the shooting alongside federal officials.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy,” Jacobson said. “Any speculation about what has happened would be just that.”

The shooting occurred in the district of Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, who described it as “state violence”, not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighbourhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have built extensive online networks, scanned licence plates for suspected federal vehicles, and stocked whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert communities to any enforcement presence.

What we know:

Dozens of people were seen gathered in the area of Hancock Park near L'Enfant Plaza starting around 5 p.m. on Jan. 7.

D.C. Police traffic posted on X about the activity, saying there are rolling and stationary road closures in the vicinity as the demonstration continues.

Just after 5:20 p.m., officials said the participants were marching west on D Street from 7th Street, SW.

By 5:45 p.m., D.C. Police Traffic said the demonstrators had gathered on the sidewalk in the 500 block of 12th Street, SW, and the only road closures remaining are at 12th Street from C Street, SW, to Maine Avenue, SW.

Dig deeper:

It appears that several organizations were encouraging protesters to join the demonstration at Hancock Park.

Movimiento Migrante DC was one of them. It's a political group that focuses on multicultural and multilingual audiences and allies in D.C.

Another is Anaknayan DC, a national democratic youth organization dedicated to serving the Filipino people and mobilizing our communities.

Some of the other groups putting out the message to join the protests are, DC Against the Trump Agenda Coalition, ILPS Baltimore-DMV and Metro DC Democratic Socialists.

The backstory:

An ICE agent fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning.

Federal officials are claiming the agent acted in self-defense, but Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is calling ""bullshit"" on that claim.The shooting happened around 9:30 a.m. in the area of East 34th Street and Portland Avenue. The woman died at the hospital.

Witnesses told FOX 9, a woman got into a red vehicle and there was one ICE agent on either side of the vehicle trying to get in, and a third ICE agent came and tried to yank on the driver's side door.

One of the agents on the driver's side door then backed away, and then opened fire, shooting three times through the driver's side window, witnesses said.

One witness claimed that the vehicle wasn't moving toward the agents. However, federal officials said ICE officers were ""conducting targeted operations"" when ""rioters"" blocked officers. One of the ""rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

Officials said an ICE officer who was ""fearing for his life"" fired ""defensive shots"" to save himself and his officers, killing the woman.

A video of the shooting shows a red Honda Pilot blocking the roadway as an ICE squad approaches. When agents approach the vehicle, the Pilot attempts to drive away, moving towards an agent. When that happens, the agent fires three shots at the driver. Police say the driver was struck in the head. The agent appears to mostly avoid the vehicle as it speeds past and ends up crashing into a parked vehicle.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/anti-ice-protest-dc.png?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-07 23:58:13.776782

President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies, and commissions, following his administration's review of participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House release.

Most of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor, migration and other issues the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and ""woke"" initiatives. Other non-U.N. organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Global Counterterrorism Forum.

""The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.

U.S. builds on pattern of exiting global agencies

The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. It has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies it believes align with Trump's agenda and those that no longer serve U.S. interests.

""I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is 'my way or the highway,'"" said Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group. ""It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington's own terms.""

It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations — both Republican and Democratic — have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.

Many independent nongovernmental agencies — some that work with the United Nations — have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Despite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The latest global organizations the U.S. is departing

The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.

UNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump — who calls climate change a hoax — withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.

Gina McCarthy, former White House National Climate Adviser, said being the only country in the world not part of the treaty is ""shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision.""

""This Administration is forfeiting our country's ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies, and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country,"" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement.

Mainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.

The U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it ""gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.

It will also be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.

The U.N. Population Fund, the agency providing sexual and reproductive health worldwide, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition, and Trump cut funding for it during his first term. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in ""coercive abortion practices"" in countries like China.

When President Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support GOP claims.

Other organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5694x3201+0+512/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F29%2Fe58fcb064f8eb472315e6c4d4421%2Fap25343442464463.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:57:02.011108

Minneapolis mayor blasts federal immigration enforcement Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly.
During a news conference hours after the ICE officer shot the woman, an angry Frey blasted the federal immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown in a major U.S. city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city’s mayor described as “reckless” and unnecessary.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him. It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of a series of immigration enforcement operations in major U.S. cities under the Trump administration. The killing was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns in a handful of states since 2024.

What federal policy says about shooting at vehicles

The Department of Justice says in its Justice Manual that firearms should not be used simply to disable a moving vehicle.

The policy allows deadly force only in limited circumstances, such as when someone in the vehicle is threatening another person with deadly force, or when the vehicle itself is being used in a way that poses an imminent risk and no reasonable alternative exists, including moving out of the vehicle’s path.

Police training experts have told The Associated Press that officers are generally taught not to step in front of moving vehicles to try to block them.

Related: DHS deploys 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis area to carry out ‘largest immigration operation ever’

Training also emphasizes weighing the totality of the situation, including whether the person involved poses an immediate danger and whether the underlying allegation involves violence.

Many department policies specifically bar firing at vehicles just to stop a fleeing suspect.

Some policing experts say the rules need flexibility, pointing to cases in which people have used vehicles as weapons, including attacks in recent years where cars were driven into crowds.

The debate has been sharpened by high-profile cases, including a 2023 shooting in Ohio in which an officer fired through a windshield in a grocery store parking lot while investigating a shoplifting allegation, killing the pregnant motorist. The officer was later charged and acquitted.

Why many police agencies limit shooting at moving vehicles

For decades, police departments across the U.S. have limited when officers are allowed to fire at moving vehicles, citing the danger to bystanders and the risk that a driver who is shot will lose control.

The New York Police Department was among the first major agencies to adopt those limits. The department barred officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car and sparked protests.

Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s later found that the policy, along with other use-of-force restrictions, helped reduce bystanders being struck by police gunfire and led to fewer deaths in police shootings.

Over the years, many law enforcement agencies followed New York’s lead. Policing organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended similar limits, warning that shooting at vehicles creates serious risks from stray gunfire or from a vehicle crashing if the driver is hit.

Minneapolis Police chief gives no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone

Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O’Hara didn’t say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. … At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.

“At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

Walz calls on protesters to remain peaceful

The governor said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He also said that like many, he is outraged about the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” But he called for calm.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference.

“If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”

Trump says the ICE officer who fatally shot the motorist appears to have been acting in self-defense

The president, in a social media post, said he’d viewed video footage of the incident and criticized the woman who was shot as acting “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and “then violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer.

The president also described another woman seen screaming in the footage of the incident he viewed as “obviously, a professional agitator.”

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said of the ICE officer.

“The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.”

A vigil is planned for the woman killed

An immigrant rights group says on Facebook that it will hold a vigil for the woman who was shot.

“We witnessed an atrocious attack on our community today,” read the post from the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. “Community members were taken from us and an observer was shot dead. ICE OUT OF MINNESOTA NOW.”

Why is the Minneapolis area the target of what immigration enforcement describes as its largest operation?

Minnesota initially grabbed President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ attention over a series of fraud cases where many of the defendants had roots in Somalia. Prosecutors say that billions of dollars were stolen from federally funded health care benefits and a COVID-19 program in recent years.

Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., a group Trump called “garbage” in December and said he didn’t want them in the country.

The president has also criticized Democratic Gov. Walz for failing to catch the alleged crimes.

Late last month, a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming that a day care center in Minneapolis run by Somali residents had taken over $100 million in fraud. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel then posted on social media about increased operations in the city partly targeting, as Patel put it, “large-scale fraud schemes.”

On Tuesday, DHS said it planned to deploy 2,000 federal agents and officers to the Minneapolis area.

Chicago experienced a similar incident during immigration crackdown

In October, a Chicago woman was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in a similar incident involving a vehicle, though she survived.

Almost immediately, Homeland Security officials issued a statement labeling Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, as a “domestic terrorist” who had “ambushed” and “rammed” agents with her vehicle.

She was charged in federal court with assaulting a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. But federal prosecutors were later forced to dismiss the case against Martinez before trial after security camera video and bodycam footage emerged that her defense lawyers said undermined the official narrative.

The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez’s truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said.

Gov. Tim Walz calls Homeland Security’s claims in the Minnesota shooting ‘propaganda’

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine,” Walz wrote on X, responding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s post alleging that a woman had “weaponized her vehicle” before she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” wrote the governor.

County attorney’s office says investigation must play out before any decision made on charges

Daniel Borgertpoepping, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, says that “We have jurisdiction to bring charges, as do the feds.

“It’s a little bit of a complicated interplay but the bottom line is yes, we have jurisdiction to bring criminal charges.”

Homeland Security secretary describes the incident as an ‘act of domestic terrorism’

Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, says it was carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Mayor Frey blasted that characterization as well as the federal deployment in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said.

Shooting occurred in modest neighborhood not far from where George Floyd was killed

The location is just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

Frey demands ICE leave Minneapolis

The mayor says in a social media post that immigration agents are “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey said.

A large throng of protesters gather at the scene after the shooting

The crowd vented its anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that harkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago immigration crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

Department of Homeland Security says an ICE officer shot the woman in a residential neighborhood

That’s according to a statement from department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

According to sister station KMBC, Minneapolis City Council members identified the victim as Renee Nicole Good, describing her as a “member of our community.”

Donna Ganger, her mother, also identified her to local media in Minneapolis. Good had a 6-year old child, her mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Good described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” who was from Colorado.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

It’s not clear where Good resided at the time of the shooting, but court records in Jackson County, Missouri, show that her name was connected to an address in Kansas City in 2023. The vehicle involved in the incident was also registered in Kansas City, Missouri, according to KMBC, which confirmed this through vehicle records from a federally recognized source.

Her killing after 9:30 a.m. was recorded on video by witnesses, and the shooting quickly drew a large crowd of angry protesters. By evening, hundreds were there for a vigil to mourn her death and urge the public to resist immigration enforcers.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It is not clear in the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer and there is no indication of whether or not the woman had interactions with ICE officers before the videos started. After the shooting, the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

In another video taken at the scene, a woman, who described Macklin Good as her spouse, is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who was not identified, said the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

In a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.

Local officials dispute the narrative

Noem claimed the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the veteran officer who fired his gun had been rammed and dragged by an anti-ICE motorist in June.

“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” Noem said, adding that the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem's version of what happened as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is (expletive),” the mayor said.

Shooting is fifth linked to crackdowns

The shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the woman in Minneapolis was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Noem said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

“She was driving away and they killed her,” said Lynette Reini-Grandell, a local resident who was among those who filmed the shooting.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers, chanting “ICE out of Minnesota” and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Protestors also gathered in several other U.S. cities on Wednesday night.

Governor calls for calm

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he's prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He described the killing as “predictable” and “avoidable."" He also said like many, he was outraged by the shooting, but he called on people to keep protests peaceful.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone.

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot the driver. Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.",https://compote.slate.com/images/76841c9c-ad18-43a1-b1dd-eb8080548632.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-08 00:57:05.386285

By asserting the absolute litigation privilege where appropriate, litigants can avoid unnecessary and costly litigation.","In American Backflow & Fire Prevention, Inc. v. Hincks et al, 2025 IL App (1st) 250023, the Illinois Appellate Court, Second District, affirmed the dismissal of claims arising from allegedly defamatory statements made to the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET), and the Illinois State Fire Marshal. The Appellate Court held that the statements were protected by Illinois’s absolute litigation privilege and reaffirmed that this privilege applies broadly to communications made before, during, or after judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings and specifically applies to complaints made to certification bodies, such as the ASSE and the NICET.

Background & Procedural Posture

The plaintiffs – a fire protection company and its owner – sued union representatives, a former employee, and counsel, alleging a coordinated campaign to interfere with their business and damage their reputation through complaints to the ASSE, NICET, and the Illinois State Fire Marshal. These complaints challenged whether plaintiffs and their employees had sufficient field experience for ASSE and NICET credentials and alleged that plaintiffs had fraudulently documented their work experience.

Plaintiffs asserted an array of claims—tortious interference with economic advantage, tortious interference with contract, defamation, defamation per se, violations of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (815 ILCS 510/1 et seq), and civil conspiracy—seeking nearly $934,000 in damages. Defendants moved to dismiss under 735 ILCS 5/2‑619(a)(9), invoking the absolute litigation privilege. The circuit court (Lake County) dismissed plaintiffs’ Complaint in its entirety, and the Second District affirmed.

The Court’s Analysis

The court’s analysis centered on Illinois’s expansive application of the absolute litigation privilege. The court reaffirmed that the privilege applies broadly to communications made before, during, or after judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, and even to statements by non-parties, so long as they are pertinent to the matter at hand. Motive is irrelevant, and any doubts about pertinency are resolved in favor of applying the privilege.

To determine whether ASSE and NICET qualified as quasi-judicial bodies, the court applied the six-factor test from Kalish v. Illinois Education Ass’n, 157 Ill. App. 3d 969, 971–72 (1987). The test considers whether the entity has the power to: (1) exercise judgment and discretion; (2) ascertain facts and decide; (3) make binding orders; (4) affect personal or property rights; (5) examine witnesses, compel their attendance, and conduct hearings; and (6) enforce decisions or impose penalties.

The court found that ASSE and NICET satisfied at least five of these factors. Both organizations investigate complaints, exercise discretion in determining whether to revoke certifications, conduct hearings with rights to counsel and witnesses, issue binding decisions on certification status, and impose penalties by revoking credentials. Although they lack subpoena power, the presence of these other powers was sufficient for the court to conclude that ASSE and NICET function as quasi-judicial bodies, triggering the absolute litigation privilege for statements made in connection with their proceedings.

The court further concluded that defendants’ statements were related to the quasi-judicial proceedings they were submitted through each entity’s formal complaint process and specifically questioned plaintiffs’ qualifications for the ASSE and NICET certifications. Even though defendants were not parties to the proceeding, their statements concerned the same subject matter and were necessary to initiate the quasi-judicial proceeding and therefore met the pertinency requirement and are thus protected by the absolute litigation privilege.

The court also found two alternative bases to support the application of the absolute litigation privilege: the statements were made in anticipation of enforcement actions under the Fire Sprinkler Contractor Licensing Act and were related to ongoing NLRB proceedings.

Finally, the court held that, while the plaintiffs brought claims other than defamation, the absolute litigation privilege extended to all claims because they arose from the same allegedly defamatory statements and were merely attempts to recast their defamation claims to avoid the protection afforded by the privilege.

Key Takeaways

This decision reinforces Illinois’s expansive view of the absolute litigation privilege and further clarifies that it can apply to communications with private certification or licensing bodies, even when the speaker is not a party to the proceeding. By asserting the absolute litigation privilege where appropriate, litigants can avoid unnecessary and costly litigation.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16387_2958.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 22:57:10.933701

Within hours of a Minnesota protester being fatally shot after allegedly attempting to run over ICE agents, a familiar network of far-left protesters for causes ranging from communism to climate change mobilized across the country.

The deceased, identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by the Minneapolis City Council on Wednesday afternoon, was killed at the wheel of her SUV just after 11 a.m. ET.

Federal authorities said she had tried to run over ICE agents who were part of a 2,000-strong team sent to the Twin Cities to round up and deport illegal immigrant criminals.

""This appears to be an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference late Wednesday in Minneapolis. ""The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.""

MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF BLASTS ICE AFTER AGENT SEEN DRAGGING WOMAN THROUGH STREET, KNEELING ON HER BACK

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Good was shot in the head, and later pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center.

""I have just viewed the [video] clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense.""

Almost immediately, various groups with causes as diverse as socialism, communism, climate change, Palestinian rights and the Democratic Party launched what seemed to be coordinated protests online and in American streets, using similar language.

The effort by left-wing groups with no obvious shared cause echoed protests over the weekend, when many of the same groups sprang into action in the hours following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

""It's the same network of people that have thousands of Americans blocking the streets, waving communist and terrorist flags and attacking law enforcement and innocents,"" said Brandy Shufutinsky, director of the Education and National Security Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""They are stoking the grievance industry that they built.""

While authorities said an investigation was underway, the protest groups were quick to brand the killing a murder. A sentiment analysis of relevant social media posts by left-wing groups showed the graphic and emotional language used in the posts was designed to provoke moral outrage and mobilize people to take to the streets. For example, posts told people to ""get in the streets now,"" ""hit the streets"" and ""get to the White House ASAP.""

Indivisible, the Democratic Party-aligned nonprofit and PAC that was at the forefront of protests against Tesla and the Trump administration, shared a picture on Instagram of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees ICE, with two Xs over eyes, a symbol often used to portray someone as dead.

""EMERGENCY ALERT. THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT!"" wrote 50551 on Instagram at 11:50 a.m.

The UNFCCC treaty forms the bedrock of international cooperation to deal with the climate crisis and has been agreed to by every country in the world since its inception 34 years ago.
“This is a shortsighted, embarrassing and foolish decision,” said Gina McCarthy, who was a top climate adviser to Joe Biden’s White House.
“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate change leadership and global collaboration.
The climate crisis is, in fact, a matter of scientific consensus and is already taking a measurable and growing toll upon economies and people’s lives.","Donald Trump has sparked outrage by announcing the US will exit the foundational international agreement to address the climate crisis, cementing the US’s utter isolation from the global effort to confront dangerously escalating temperatures.

In a presidential memorandum issued on Wednesday, Trump withdrew from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions, calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States”.

The UNFCCC treaty forms the bedrock of international cooperation to deal with the climate crisis and has been agreed to by every country in the world since its inception 34 years ago. The US Senate ratified the treaty in October 1992.

Trump has, however, routinely ridiculed climate science as a “scam” and a “hoax” and has actively hobbled clean energy projects and other climate policies as president, attempting to force the US and other countries to stay wedded to the fossil fuels that are driving disastrous heatwaves, storms, droughts and conflicts that imperils billions of people around the world.

“This is a shortsighted, embarrassing and foolish decision,” said Gina McCarthy, who was a top climate adviser to Joe Biden’s White House.

“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate change leadership and global collaboration. This administration is forfeiting our country’s ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country.”

Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump’s decision to exit the UNFCCC is an “unforced error” and “self-defeating” as it will further hamper the US’s ability to compete with China, which is increasingly dominant in the world’s burgeoning clean energy technology industries.

“While the Trump administration is abdicating the United States of America’s global leadership, the rest of the world is continuing to shift to cleaner power sources and take climate action,” Bapna said.

“The Trump administration is ceding the trillions of dollars in investment that the clean energy transition brings to nations willing to follow the science and embrace the cleanest, cheapest sources of energy.”

Underscoring the administration’s hostility to any measure to deal with a climate that is now hotter than at any point in human civilization, the White House memo also states that the US will pull out from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top climate science body, as well as an assortment of other international environmental organizations, including the International Renewable Energy Association, the International Solar Alliance and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Last year, Trump said the US would exit the Paris climate deal, in which countries agreed to limit dangerous global heating, while the administration also declined to send a delegation to UN climate talks in Brazil.

As the UNFCCC treaty was ratified by the Senate, it is unclear whether Trump can unilaterally scrap it, or whether a future president will be able to rejoin the framework without a further Senate vote. “Letting this lawless move stand could shut the US out of climate diplomacy forever,” said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said in a statement that the agreements jettisoned by the administration on Wednesday are “often dominated by progressive ideology and detached from national interests”.

The climate crisis is, in fact, a matter of scientific consensus and is already taking a measurable and growing toll upon economies and people’s lives. In the US, record numbers of major extreme weather disasters are forcing insurers to flee states, undermining the country’s property market. Scientists have warned that global temperatures are set to breach previously agreed thresholds, which will trigger further worsened calamities.

“On the one-year anniversary of the wildfires that stole dozens of lives, thousands of homes and the sense of safety for millions as it reduced Los Angeles communities to ash, Trump is making it clear he has no interest in protecting Americans from the rapidly increasing impacts on our health and safety of the worsening climate crisis,” said Loren Blackford, executive director of the Sierra Club. “This is not leadership. It is cowardice.”

Al Gore, the former US vice-president and climate activist, told the Guardian: “The Trump Administration has been turning its back on the climate crisis since day one, removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, dismantling America’s scientific infrastructure, curbing access to greenhouse gas emissions data, and ending essential investments in the clean energy transition.”

“They’ve done this at the behest of the oil industry, so that billionaires can rake in even more money while polluting our planet and endangering people in America and around the world,” Gore said.

Other organizations and agencies that the US will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

Tennessee and federal authorities have given conflicting narratives of what happened the morning of Jan. 7.

Before the shooting, the woman, who has not yet been identified, was reportedly observing immigration enforcement activities as agents surged into the city in what the federal government described as the ""largest immigration operation ever.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has described the woman's actions as an ""act of domestic terrorism,"" saying the agent ""fired defensive shots"" after the woman allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle,"" and attempted to ram officers with it.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey disputed those claims at a news conference, saying videos show the woman driving away from federal agents, not toward them. Minneapolis authorities have said the woman was in her vehicle blocking the road when a federal officer approached her on foot. When she began to drive off, at least two shots were fired and the vehicle crashed on the side of the road.

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota, described the woman as a ""legal observer,"" and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. said the woman was a U.S. citizen.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are both investigating.

U.S. Rep. Ogles, R-Columbia, issued a statement shortly after the shooting.“Pray for our ICE patriots. Democrats continue to demonize the men and women doing everything in their power to make our country safe,” Ogles shared in an X post. “If you put an ICE agent in mortal danger, self-defense is JUSTIFIED,” he added.

In a later post, Ogles shared video of the incident, reiterating support for ICE.

""I stand with ICE,"" Ogles wrote. ""Completely justified.""

U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen

U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen called the incident ""deeply disturbing.""

""Reports out of Minneapolis are deeply disturbing: a woman was killed during an ICE operation. Whatever the facts ultimately show, a federal enforcement action ended with a civilian death ― that should concern everyone,"" Cohen said.

Cohen said the shooting ""raises serious concerns"" for communities like Memphis where ICE remains operational.

""ICE is actively recruiting, running ads that promise big money and seem to suggest looser standards than traditional law enforcement. That should worry people, and it's an issue that I've already raised directly with AG Bondi and others,"" Cohen said.

""Federal agents operating in our neighborhoods must be properly trained, held to the law, and subject to real accountability ― not encouraged to believe the rules don't apply to them,"" he said. ""Enough is enough.""

The Minneapolis City Council identified the 37-year-old woman shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday as Renee Nicole Good.

""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government,"" the city council said in a statement. NPR member station MPR News has reached out to a family member of the woman.

A post on an Instagram account that appears to belong to Good states she was a “poet and writer and wife and mom and s***** guitar strummer from Colorado; experiencing Minneapolis, MN,” according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.

The shooting occurred on a residential street in south Minneapolis — less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. ICE agents were conducting targeted immigration enforcement operations at the time, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

“Renee was brutally killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent, leaving behind a child. Her killing is inexcusable and the direct result of an agency that, under Donald Trump, has become an unrestrained paramilitary force: increasingly aggressive, hostile, unaccountable and detached from basic standards of public safety,” Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said in a statement. “No federal agency should be allowed to operate above the law, and no federal agent should be able to patrol our streets with masks and zero accountability for introducing violence and heartbreak to our neighborhoods.”

Federal and local officials dispute the circumstances that led to the shooting.

NPR has reviewed multiple videos of the shooting taken from different vantage points and posted to social media. The footage shows multiple officers near an SUV stopped in the middle of the road. One officer demands the driver exit the vehicle and grabs the car handle. The SUV reverses, then begins to drive forward, which is when a different officer near the front of the car pulls his weapon and fires into the vehicle. Three gunshots are heard as the firing officer backs away from the SUV. Moments later, the vehicle crashes.

The incident has further inflamed tensions between the Trump administration and Minneapolis, which has been the target of a large-scale immigration crackdown. Local officials said they expect protests to follow and urged residents to remain peaceful.

At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to mobilize the state National Guard if necessary.

""They want a show. We can't give it to them,"" he said. ""We can't give them what they want.""

Federal and local officials clash over the shooting

In a statement, DHS spokesperson McLaughlin asserted that the motorist ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them."" She added that the ICE officer who pulled the trigger was ""fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public.""

An eyewitness told MPR News that ICE agents gave conflicting orders to a driver in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, with one agent ordering her to drive away from the scene where an ICE vehicle was stuck in a snowbank while another yelled for her to get out of her car as he reached for the door handle.

The scene ended with an agent shooting into the car, killing the woman.

Caitlin Callenson said she was walking down Portland Avenue with her partner when she saw what she assumed were Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“They tried to zoom their car out of the snowbank but were just stuck,” she said.

She said other ICE vehicles showed up, leading neighbors to believe it might be an ICE enforcement action. People showed up, and some began blowing whistles.

“People in our neighborhood have been terrorized by ICE for six weeks. We want our neighbors safe, and so when we see a group of ICE vehicles, people in the community are showing up and saying, ‘This is not OK,’” she said.

Upon reviewing a video of the incident, President Trump said he also believes the shooting was an act of self-defense.

""The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

But local leaders have raised concerns about the Trump administration's account of the shooting.

At a fiery press conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey accused ICE of ""trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull***. ""

""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,"" he added.

The mayor called on ICE agents to leave the city, asserting that federal immigration authorities were ripping families apart and sowing chaos on Minneapolis streets.

Gov. Walz wrote on X that he has seen video of the shooting and told the public: ""Don't believe this propaganda machine.""

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,"" he added.

Minneapolis police chief says he's 'very concerned' about use of deadly force

At a press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said local police arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound to the head. They performed life-saving measures at the scene, including CPR. The woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he added.

Preliminary information, according to O'Hara, indicated that the woman was in her vehicle and blocking the road on Portland Avenue between 33rd and 34th St.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,"" he said, adding that the car then crashed on the side of the roadway.

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents. He noted that the use of deadly force is justified at times, but that most law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are trained to minimize the risks and the need for deadly force.

""In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle of someone who's not armed,"" he said.

The shooting is being investigated by the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. They will investigate the use of deadly force.

Today’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer has increased tensions in Minneapolis after weeks of strain from immigration enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.","A woman with blood covering her face sat in the yard of Minneapolis resident Tyrice Jones’ home following the fatal ICE shooting of a woman this morning, Jones said, and was heard shouting, “You guys just killed my wife!”

Jones, 35, was in an upstairs apartment when he heard gunshots and a crash, prompting him to come outside and see the SUV driven by Renee Nicole Good had smashed into a streetlight directly in front of his building, he said.

He told the woman to call “her people,” to which she replied, “We have nobody out here. We’re from out of town,” said Jones, who said no one offered the woman medical aid. The woman later gave her black lab to a bystander and people in a group chat were attempting to find her so they could return her dog, he added.

The resident of Portland Avenue then captured video showing the immediate aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting, including agents at the driver’s seat assessing the situation and bystanders berating the agents for shooting the driver.

Jones said agents took the woman driver’s body out of the crashed car and set her on the ground, after which he saw four or five people carry her body by the arms and legs to the end of the block and set her on the ground until an ambulance arrived.

The scene where Renee Nicole Good was shot by an ICE agent is “very calm” now, a stark contrast to the moments of anger directed at police officers earlier, CNN law enforcement correspondent Whitney Wild said.

“It is completely quiet because this is steps from where this woman lost her life,” said Wild, reporting on the ground, describing it as a “moment of real reverence.”

She pointed to a growing memorial site with hundreds of candles and bouquets of flowers dedicated to the 37-year-old woman.

“All these people here are taking a moment to look at this vigil, reflect on her life, reflect on what this moment means,” she said. “This is just so striking. This is right where she spent her last moments.”

It’s a departure from earlier when an angry crowd confronted Minneapolis police officers, yelling and throwing snowballs at them, she said.

“It was a really striking moment … because Minneapolis police were taking that heat from the public for something that they were not involved in. And yet the public felt like they were where they were going to direct their anger,” she said.

Out of an abundance of caution to quell any potential unruly crowds overnight, Minneapolis police have requested mutual aid resources from the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Department as well as state police to be available in the area, a law enforcement source tells CNN.

The Minneapolis Police Department has also canceled days off for officers and recalled all sworn law enforcement officers to be available for assignment if needed. The source noted there is no indication violence will occur, but law enforcement resources are being staged out of an abundance of caution.

Speaking with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday night, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed his department will be at an elevated state of readiness throughout the night with additional resources on standby.

A witness to the fatal ICE shooting of a woman in a vehicle said she did not appear to be driving aggressively, calling the incident “an unnecessary use of force in a reaction to imagined danger.”

Trevor Heitkamp disputed the Department of Homeland Security’s claims the agent fired his weapon in self-defense, aligning with state and local officials. The Minneapolis resident was in front of his house when he started to hear the incident unfold down the street, prompting him to record a video.

As he got closer, Heitkamp said a red SUV was turned “mostly sideways in the road” to obstruct ICE agents, who shouted at the driver to move the car, he told CNN. “The car backed up slowly and proceeded to pull forward pretty slowly,” while witnesses shouted in protest, he said.

That vehicle then crashed into a nearby car when the ICE agent put his weapon back into its holster, Heitkamp said. The agents on scene were shouting, “No pulse!” when a man who identified himself as a physician told the officers to let him administer emergency medical care, he added.

The agents rejected his offers, telling the doctor to “back up,” Heitkamp said, at least two or three minutes before emergency medical services arrived on the scene.

Emily Heller was making breakfast in her Minneapolis home when she first noticed ICE agents quarrelling with protesters on her street.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were yelling at a woman driving an SUV, Heller told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday.

An ICE agent then tried to open her car door as another stood nearby. “She reversed a little bit,” Heller said, and then turned her wheels to begin pulling away.

“An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, ‘Stop!’ and then — I mean, she was already moving — and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,” Heller said.

Heller, 39, said a neighbor who is a physician told agents he would like to administer CPR, but the agents didn’t allow him help, saying an emergency responder was en route.

“It was at least 15 minutes before the ambulance arrived,” Heller said.

Because the street was clogged with ICE vehicles, emergency crews were forced to abandon their ambulance and approach the victim on foot with no stretcher, Heller said.

“They were with her for a few minutes and then they carried her limp body away — by her limbs, not even on a stretcher,” Heller said.

“My life is forever changed from having witnessed this,” said Heller, who told CNN the narrative that the ICE agent acted in self defense is false.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent’s actions, saying the woman had attempted to run the agent over in an act of “domestic terrorism.”

This morning, Ugene Bentley watched from his front window as a confrontation between ICE agents and a woman turned deadly, killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Bentley said he saw an SUV blocking both lanes of traffic, and heard the driver blowing a whistle and yelling out an open window of her vehicle to let people know that ICE agents were nearby.

Bentley said an agent took a video of the front and rear of the car.

“I’m thinking at that time that they can follow up,” he said, noting that he assumed they recorded her license plate.

He said a truck then pulled up and more ICE agents got out, and as one tried to open an SUV door, another walked in front of the vehicle and fired the shots after Good pulled forward.

Bentley said he felt the lethal use of force was unwarranted.

“I’m not the judge on what’s legal and what’s not legal, but that right there was not called for,” he said.

People need to be paying attention to what’s happening in Minneapolis as the moment is testing “the endurance of our republic,” Mayor Jacob Frey told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

“The notion that this is domestic terrorism on the form of the victim is positively ridiculous. The way that ICE is behaving is reckless,” he said, repeating a previous statement that both the characterization of the incident and ICE’s behavior is “bullshit.”

What is important now, Frey said, is for Minneapolis residents to stand up and peacefully protest.

“This federal government wants to have an excuse to militarize Minneapolis and bring additional occupation to our city,” he said. “We won’t let them. We are going to do the right thing, we are going to be filled with hope, we are going to get justice, and we are going to make sure that we are doing right, not just by Minneapolis, but we’re going to be an example for other cities throughout the country to follow.”

The woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent today should be alive, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said.

“Renee Nicole Good should be alive,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “She was killed by an ICE agent, and the video footage that we have seen with our own eyes was a very different story from what we’re hearing from Kristi Noem and Donald Trump.”

Good was a mother of a 6-year-old, and even had stuffed animals in her car at the time of the shooting that belonged to her child, Flanagan said.

“This is outrageous. And we all should be incredibly upset by what we witnessed today,” she said, adding that she is calling for justice and transparency in this investigation.

Today’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer has increased tensions in Minneapolis after weeks of strain from immigration enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.

“I have been worried – not that federal law enforcement activity was happening, but how that enforcement was taking place in the city,” O’Hara told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “And I have specifically said I’ve been worried we would have a tragedy in our community.”

He noted that his department, and many police departments around the country, have been trained “with a very, very strong emphasis on de-escalation” to try and prevent officers or civilians from being injured.

O’Hara said he is not aware of the injured ICE officer’s identity. He said when he asked about any other injuries at today’s shooting scene, he was told “only the woman” was hurt, although it’s not immediately clear which agency he got that information from.

Footage of Wednesday’s shooting in Minneapolis appears to show the wheels of the vehicle driven by the victim were turned away from officers, according to CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, despite early claims by federal officials that the victim had weaponized her SUV against ICE agents.

Many major cities’ police departments follow the doctrine that shooting at a moving vehicle is not tactically sound. A 2023 study by the Police Executive Research Forum, an influential law enforcement think tank, recommended agencies’ policies “should prohibit shooting at or from a moving vehicle,” unless the driver of the vehicle is using it as a “weapon of mass destruction” in a situation like a ramming attack or car bombing.

Still, whether federal officials will deem the shooting justified is a “challenging question,” Miller said, because it will likely turn on the officer’s mindset.

“You’re seeing the car move forward, you see your partner who may be dragged by the car, you’re seeing that the car may hit you,” he said. “And in that tunnel vision, sometimes you make decisions absent the big picture.”

“It still begs the tactical question – and this is not a new question – which is, if you’re facing a moving vehicle and it’s a threat to you because you’re in the way, get out of the way,” Miller said.

“That’s not a suggestion on my part,” he added. “That has been the policy adopted by the New York City Police Department when I was there, by the Los Angeles Police Department when I was there, by the FBI and federal agencies.”

The ICE agent who fatally shot a woman on Wednesday morning in Minneapolis “feared for his life and the other officers around him,” said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The incident unfolded at 10:25 a.m. CT as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were conducting operations in the city, Noem said. One of their vehicles became “stuck and ensnared in the snow,” she said. As officers were attempting to push the vehicle out of the snow, Noem said a “mob of agitators that were harassing them all day” blocked them in and attempted to impede their efforts.

One of those vehicles, Noem said, was being driven by the victim, who the secretary accused of “stalking and impeding” officers’ work throughout the day. ICE agents ordered the woman to get out of the car, but she refused, Noem said, and then proceeded to “weaponize her vehicle” in an attempt to run over the officer.

That federal agent “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues,” Noem said, before he was treated and released from a local hospital.

State and local officials have disputed claims that the shooting was done in self-defense.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem disputed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s claim that he does not know when there will be ICE operations in the state.

“That’s simply not true,” she said at a news conference today, responding to a question about Walz saying that he is not given prior notice to actions.

Noem said she would provide the governor with that information, adding that “we would love to coordinate with him.”

The secretary also accused Walz and local police of not cooperating with federal immigration efforts, adding that his administration does not give DHS “access to any information on criminals.”

She also claimed Walz has “individuals and criminals in his jurisdiction that he won’t turn over.”

Noem said she discussed the fatal shooting with Walz, but stressed they have “two very different viewpoints.”

Noem said she told Walz immigration laws need to be enforced, and she encouraged the governor “to work with us,” adding the federal agencies conducting immigration efforts in the state “have never had a cooperative arrangement” with the state or Minneapolis police officers under the discretion of Mayor Jacob Frey.

“If you talk to any of these federal law enforcement officers, they’ll say that when they call for backup in a situation that it’s hit and miss,” said Noem. She continued to say the officers were “grateful” for the city’s police chief and local officers helping to secure the scene today after the fatal shooting to ensure “nobody was harmed and that the FBI could do their work.”

Throngs of Minnesota residents and activists are holding a vigil around a makeshift shrine of flowers and candles on a patch of snow near where 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer hours earlier.

“Say it once. Say it twice. We will not put up with ICE,” they chanted. Some carried signs with messages such as “Killer ICE off our streets.”

Speakers said the actions of the federal officers are unacceptable and a direct result of a what they called militarized state with no accountability. They called for charges against the ICE officer who fatally shot the woman in her vehicle, noting that she had been there to observe the actions of federal officers.

“We are not afraid of Donald Trump and we are not afraid to say f— ICE,” one speaker said.

At one point, they chanted the name of victim.

Yards from the scene of today’s shooting – and just blocks from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020 – residents filled the streets during a peaceful yet loud candlelight vigil, paying their respects and leaving flowers on a still-bloodied patch of snow where Good died.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/10408395221424057092368003293201021-00000005.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-07 21:57:38.980289

“For months, I – along with many of my fellow elected officials, law enforcement agencies and community members – have warned of the dangers of the Trump Administration’s chaotic, reckless and unnecessary ICE operations in our cities.

Today, our worst fears became reality when an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in South Minneapolis. This is beyond unacceptable. It’s unconscionable and sickening.

President Trump and his Administration will try to justify their meddling in Minnesota – they will continue to lie and say it’s about keeping folks safe – but Minnesotans know this isn’t true. It’s a flat-out lie. Today, the President’s political stunt got a woman killed.

Trump’s actions have never been about keeping people safe. They have never been about catching criminals. They have always been about weaponizing our immigration system and using immigrant communities as political pawns.

President Trump, Secretary Noem, hear me loud and clear: ICE must leave Minnesota – NOW.

We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants are essential members of our communities. Immigrants make up the fabric of our state – and they make us stronger.

To my fellow Minnesotans, stay peaceful. Take care of one another and know that I am fighting this reckless Administration at every turn. We won’t back down.”

“My office is monitoring reports of an ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis today. Reports are still coming in, but [it] has been reported that a woman was killed. My heart goes out to her and her family. And anyone hurt or killed in this act of violence,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) wrote Wednesday in a post on the social platform X.

The shooting happened, according to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, when “violent rioters” tried to get involved in a Minneapolis ICE operation.

“While there’s a lot we don’t know at this time, let me be clear about one thing: Donald Trump’s decision to send thousands of armed ICE agents to Minnesota is causing serious harm and spreading terror throughout our communities. His reckless decision to escalate the aggression and number of immigration agents is a causal factor,” Ellison said.

President Trump, in a post to Truth Social on Wednesday afternoon, said he had “just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota.”

“It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he added.

Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), in a post on X, put the blame on federal authorities for the woman’s death.

“ICE just killed a U.S. citizen—allegedly blocking her from medical care and letting her die,” the Arizona Democrat said. “This is horrifying. ICE is a rogue agency incapable of reform. Minneapolis Mayor Frey is calling for ICE to vacate the city and I echo that call.”

Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey used explicit language while arguing that the Trump administration’s framing of the events of the shooting were wrong. The mayor also said he had viewed a video of the incident.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over a fraud scandal in the state. Federal authorities this week launched an expansive immigration operation there in the wake of right-wing ire zeroing in on the Midwestern state.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, also went after the Trump administration for its characterization of the incident.

“A woman in Minnesota was shot and killed by ICE today. We all saw the video, and the Trump administration is lying about it,” Martin said on X.

“The federal government under Donald Trump’s command is not protecting the peace. Trump has provoked chaos and violence in our towns and cities as part of his sick political theater. ICE has to leave Minnesota now,” he added.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in an X post that “this is not the first time Trump’s ICE has shot at civilians.”

In response to the claims DOL and WSP are violating the Keep Washington Working Act, they denied they were.","SEATTLE — Luis remembers the morning clearly.

It was just after 6:30 a.m. when his father left their home in Renton and was near The Landing, heading to work. Minutes later, immigration agents surrounded the car.

“He pulls over, rolls the window down, and they put their arms in there, reach out, open the door and take his keys and take him in and put him in one of the SUV vans,” Luis said.

Since that day, he and his sister, Izzy, have kept asking the same question:

How did immigration agents know who their father was, and where he’d be?

“It doesn't seem like a regular pull over,” Luis said. “Because they did say his name… seems more of a — they were watching routine.”

A new report from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights says it now has the answer.

A new pathway into Washington driver data

The report traces how immigration agents located Nelson Eduardo Picazo Sanchez, and links his case to a broader pattern.

Last July, KING 5 Investigators revealed that the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) had been sharing driver information with immigration enforcement, in violation of state law. The Keep Washington Working Act prohibits state agencies from assisting federal immigration enforcement efforts. After public backlash, state leaders said they shut down that access to ICE.

But researchers say federal immigration authorities continued getting Washington driver data through a different channel.

“Personally, I think that's very disappointing,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights and primary author of the report. “This isn’t the first time, not the second time, not even the third time that they’ve been caught not doing what they said.”

According to the report, agents used a Washington State Patrol system called ACCESS — a messaging “switchboard” that connects to a national law-enforcement network known as Nlets.

Through ACCESS and Nlets, officers can enter a license plate number and receive driver and vehicle information from DOL within seconds.

License plates, profiling concerns, and fast arrests

Godoy said the center reviewed multiple cases where agents appeared to stake out locations, run plates, and then make arrests shortly afterward.

“A significant percentage of the arrests we corroborated happened near places like Home Depot, Lowe’s, or Latino markets,” Godoy said. “It enables racial profiling when you go where you think a certain ethnicity congregates and then run the plates of everyone you see.”

In Sanchez’s case, Godoy said Washington State Patrol records show Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requested information tied to his license plate through ACCESS. DOL then sent back data associated with the vehicle and driver.

Sanchez was arrested on Nov. 4.

UW researchers identified at least seven other cases where immigration arrests happened after agents used ACCESS, sometimes within minutes of the search.

“In many of these cases, they run the name in Nlets or their own databases, see an immigration record and then they pull the person over,” Godoy said.

State law says agencies should not help enforce civil immigration cases

Washington’s Keep Washington Working Act bars state agencies from using their resources to help enforce civil immigration law.

The report argues that, in practice, that’s still happening when immigration agents use ACCESS to obtain driver data tied to Washington residents.

After the report's draft release, Godoy said her team reached out to the Washington State Patrol. When the state patrol found out the data was getting accessed through their system, they said they cut it off to ICE mid-November.

But experts at the UW say there are ways around that—there's other federal agencies like border patrol that could still be using this to track people down.

“If they're working shoulder to shoulder with CBP, and one agency loses access while the one next to them still has it, it doesn't do anything to stop the operation,” she said.

For one family, the findings feel personal

For Luis and Izzy, the policy debate isn’t abstract.

Their father was simply on his way to work. Somewhere, they believe, someone ran his license plate and agents already knew his name before he rolled down the window.

“It wasn’t me finding that out — it was little me,” Izzy said, fighting back tears as she recalled the day of her father's arrest. “I’ve always been a daddy’s girl. It felt like me as a little girl, getting my dad ripped away from me.”

DOL and WSP respond

State officials say the University of Washington’s findings leave out key context. In a joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the Department of Licensing and Washington State Patrol argued Washington has already taken aggressive steps to block immigration agencies from driver data, and disputed suggestions the state is violating the Keep Washington Working Act. T

hey say ICE’s access was shut off in November and that the systems involved are also used for legitimate criminal investigations.

“Since shutting off ICE access … thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied,"" the joint statement added in part.

In response to the claims DOL and WSP are violating the Keep Washington Working Act, they denied they were.

“The Keep Washington Working Act does not prohibit information-sharing for criminal law-enforcement purposes,” the statement reads.

As for not shutting off CBP's access to ACCESS/Nlets, state officials said, ""Washington state is taking a close look at all our options to protect our residents. This is an ongoing effort. We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety.""

In the last four months alone, immigration officers have fired on at least nine people in five states and Washington, D.C. All of the individuals targeted in those shootings were, like the woman killed on Wednesday, fired on while in their vehicles. In each case, officials have claimed that the agents fired in self-defense, fearing they would be struck by the vehicle.

At least one other person died as a result of those shootings.

In September, immigration officers pulled over a man driving a Subaru on a busy street outside of Chicago. The man, a Mexican immigrant named Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was shot and killed less than a minute later. Homeland security officials said that Mr. Villegas-Gonzalez had hit and dragged one of the officers with his car and that the officer who shot him was acting in self-defense. But a Times analysis of video calls into question key aspects of the government’s account.

The following month, a Mexican man living in Los Angeles was shot during a traffic stop where the man was targeted for immigration enforcement. Federal officials said the man, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, had tried to ram officers as he fled the scene, and homeland security officers fired shots, hitting the man in the elbow. A federal marshal was struck in the hand by a ricocheted bullet.

Days later, an American citizen was shot in the shoulder by an immigration agent near a bus stop in a suburb east of Los Angeles. Lawyers for the man, Carlos Jimenez, said he had asked federal agents to move away from the area, where schoolchildren would soon be gathering. Mr. Jimenez’s lawyers said he was later shot as he was driving away. But federal prosecutors accused him of pulling forward and accelerating toward an officer.

Since last January, federal immigration agents have deployed across the country as part of President Trump’s deportation blitz, often in fast-moving enforcement operations targeting individual cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Portland. Those sweeps have spurred protests that at times turned hostile, with protesters throwing objects at law enforcement and officers responding by firing non-lethal munitions.

In the 12 months through September 2024, ICE’s internal firearms and use of force committee investigated three incidents in which an officer used a firearm, according to ICE’s annual report, and in the year before that, there were five incidents in which an ICE officer used a firearm. It was not known on Wednesday what those investigations concluded.

ICE and the Homeland Security Department’s policy on the use of force says that officers are authorized to use deadly force only if the officer “has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” The policy further states that officers should “avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07minn-shooting-ice-elsewhere-top-khlq/07minn-shooting-ice-elsewhere-top-khlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 21:57:53.889166

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening that any death is a ""tragedy,"" but that the ICE shooting was justified.

""Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he's been taught to do in that situation,"" Noem said.

Noem alleged that the woman who was killed was trying to block officers with her vehicle, had been harassing them through the day and ""attempted to run a law enforcement officer over"" before she was shot.

""We'll let the FBI continue the investigation to get it resolved,"" she said, adding that the officer was hit by the vehicle, taken to a hospital and released.

Noem added that immigration enforcement has made over 1,500 arrests in Minnesota in recent weeks.

Earlier Wednesday while visiting Texas, Noem described the incident as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" carried out against ICE officers.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization as ""garbage"" and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said.

Minneapolis Police chief gives no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone

Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O'Hara didn't say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

""This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,"" the chief said.

""At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.""

That's according to Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

""Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,"" Jacobson told reporters.

McLaughlin said in a statement that ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when the 37-year-old woman was shot.","Minneapolis Mayor Frey tonight doubled down on his rejection of federal officials' characterization of today's fatal shooting as an act of self-defense.

“Of course I stand by what I said,” he told Tom Llamas on ""Top Story."" ""Look, I’ve got two eyes. All of you do, too. You can see for yourself what happened was reckless, and, by the way, entirely predictably because we have been saying, the chief and I vocally for over a month, that somebody was going to get hurt or killed.""

“By the way, this is not like the first instance of horrific treatment. They were dragging a pregnant woman through the snow; we’ve seen them indiscriminately pulling Latino and Somali people off the street. That is not the way we behave in America,” he said about immigration officials' actions.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated that the ICE agent opened fire in self-defense.

Frey said the victim was “clearly trying to leave the situation and get out of there.” He said his office has not yet spoken with the family of the victim.

He called for the shooting to be thoroughly investigated. The state has said the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will investigate.

“Get ICE out of this city,” Frey reiterated. “Right now crime is dropping in virtually every category, in virtually every neighborhood. That is important work. But what is clear is that the actions that ICE is taking is not about keeping people safe. It’s about terrorizing communities, it’s about ripping families apart, it’s about eating away at the very fabric that makes Minneapolis, Minneapolis, and America, America.""

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, today criticized DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s use of the term “domestic terrorism” to describe a woman who was shot by an ICE agent while in her vehicle today.

Smith called Noem’s description “reckless” and said it came while the incident is still under investigation, including by the FBI.

“Domestic terrorism was the Oklahoma City bombing,” Smith said. “This was a woman in her car in a neighborhood that is only a few miles from where I live. I know it quite well.”

The shooting was captured on video by a bystander.

“When you have an event like this, you have a killing like this, there is an investigation — you bring in people who know how to do investigations to understand exactly what happened,” Smith said.

“And yet the president of the United States and the secretary have been just pronouncing what they think happened,” Smith said. “I can see with my own eyes what millions of people have now seen in this video.”

She said it is hard to see in this video, any evidence that this woman rammed ICE agents.

At a news conference tonight, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem provided an account of the moments before shots rang out in Minneapolis.

She said ICE was carrying out operations in Minnesota at 10:25 a.m. CT today and attempting to push out of the snow one of its vehicles that had become stuck. At that time, “a mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began blocking them in, shouting at them, and impeding law enforcement operations,” Noem said.

ICE officers approached the driver of a vehicle that was “blocking the officers in,” she said. According to Noem, the woman “had been stalking and impeding their work all throughout the day.”

ICE agents ordered her to exit the vehicle, but she did not comply, Noem said.

“She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle, and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said. “The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.""

Witnesses at the scene have told NBC News that the woman did not appear to try to run over the ICE agent. Rather, they said, it seemed she was trying to drive away from them.

Noem said the ICE agent involved in today's shooting was ""hit by the vehicle"" the victim was driving.

""She hit him. He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,"" Noem said.

She said the officer, whom officials have not yet identified, had been attacked before while on the job.

""In fact, the very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time as well,"" she said.

A crowd has gathered in Minneapolis for a vigil following today’s fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent in an incident that has sparked outrage and condemnation among local officials and residents.

In a notice about the event, organizers said, “We witnessed an atrocious attack on our community today.”

Some held signs, including one that read “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Dieu Do, an immigrant rights activist, told NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis that “it could have been any of us.”

She disputed the characterization by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that the person who was shot was engaging in an “act of domestic terrorism” and driving toward ICE.

“Domestic terrorism is what ICE is doing — using unmarked vehicles, unmarked clothing, coming in and taking our community members without any paperwork,” Do said.

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., today said she wants ICE out of the state.

“I think ICE should leave,” Smith said. “The longer that they are in Minnesota, the less safe people are. And I think we could see today the implication of that, this senseless killing of this woman who was in her car.”

Smith also got emotional when asked why she thought the Trump administration is fixated on Minnesota.

“I wish I knew,” Smith said. “I mean, I wish they would just leave us the f--- alone. I mean, seriously.”

“When did things stop being about politics and and start being about actual human decency?” she said.

“We can all hypothesize on what all of their political reasons are,” Smith said. “But meanwhile, a woman died being shot in her car — and everything that they are doing is making it worse and not better.”

Emily Heller, 39, wasn't even dressed when she heard whistles alerting the neighborhood that ICE agents were in the area this morning.

“I’ve never seen someone die in front of my house before. This was horrendous,” Heller told NBC News.

Heller said she's never been involved in activities to warn or protest the federal immigration agency, but when she walked out to her porch she said she saw six or seven ICE vehicles and a protester who had parked perpendicular to traffic.

Heller said she saw agents exit their cars and tell the driver to leave, to ""get out of here.""

“And then they went up to her car and started trying to open her door, and that’s when I’m sure she got spooked and tried to flee,"" Heller said. ""So she reversed a little bit and then angled her wheels so she could drive away. And as she was trying to move forward, one of the ICE agents stepped in front of her vehicle and reached across the hood and fired his weapon about three or four times and shot her in the face.""

The driver crashed into a post and hit some cars and “just slumped over in her vehicle,"" Heller said. She shared graphic video that shows the woman covered in blood in the driver's seat. A man with raised arms who identified himself as a physician asked ICE agents if he could check the woman's pulse but was denied, according to both Heller's account and the video.

Heller said the agents wouldn't let anyone near the scene and told people that emergency services were on the way. In the video, one agent can be heard saying, ""We have our own medics.""

It took about 15 minutes for EMS to arrive, Heller estimated, because vehicles were blocking the street.

“They were on foot when they got through, and they carried her body out, just like by her limbs, they didn’t even have a stretcher,"" Heller said. ""She was carried out like a sack of potatoes.""

“I’ve never seen anything like this before. This was horrific and will change my life forever,” she said. “It’s just so terrifying. I feel so scared.""

She said she felt as if the ICE agents were untrained, inexperienced and didn’t know what they were doing. Heller said the driver was being told to leave but also being instructed to stop at the same time, then the man ""just fired"" his gun.

""They’re just out of their league, and they didn’t know how to handle the situation,"" Heller said. ""They couldn’t let somebody give life support. It was just total chaos.”

She said at times she was frightened watching the agents, some of whom were touching their guns. Heller thought in that moment, ""oh ... I could die,"" she said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz repeatedly implored residents to remain calm and not “take the bait” from the Trump administration in the wake of the fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis.

His words during a news conference echoed those of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who last year warned his owned residents not to allow protests to turn violent. At the time, Pritzker argued Trump officials were looking for a pretext to militarize their cities.

Walz gave the same warning, noting that there could be far-reaching consequences.

""To Minnesotans, don’t take the bait. Do not take the bait. Do not allow them to deploy federal troops into here. Do not allow them to invoke the insurrection act. Do not allow them to declare martial law,"" Walz said. ""Do not allow them to lie about the security and the decency of this state. And let’s let this investigation play out.”

President Donald Trump defended the actions of the ICE officer involved in the fatal shooting.

The president said in a post on Truth Social that he viewed a clip of the incident, calling it ""a horrible thing to watch.""

""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,"" he wrote. ""Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now but is now recovering in the hospital.""

Trump said that law enforcement officers and ICE agents are regularly threatened.

""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, expressed concern that the statements made by Homeland Security officials do ""not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts.""

The fourth-term Minnesota senator expressed condolences for the family of the woman who was killed today before criticizing the role of ICE agents in the state. She called for full transparency and an investigation into the shooting.

""While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe,"" Klobuchar said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., called the actions of the federal agents ""unconscionable and reprehensible"" in her own statement this afternoon. She described the woman who was killed as a ""legal observer"" and characterized the events as ""state violence.""

“This administration has shown, yet again, that it does not care about the safety of Minnesotans,"" Omar said. ""Instead of protecting our communities, they are unleashing violence — terrorizing neighborhoods and now killing a civilian.""

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he was just waking up when he heard the honking and other activity outside his home, which faces the street where the shooting took place, and went to the window.

He said he saw a Honda askew between the curbside and the bike lane, its front end poking into the bike lane. He said there were two men in full fatigues, wearing garments that said ""police,"" but no other identification.

""One was right by the passenger door and one by the driver’s side. There was clearly commotion. I couldn’t hear what anybody was saying,"" Perzana said. ""Then a third person approached the vehicle from the driver's side and started pulling quite hard on the door handle two or three times, at which the vehicle reversed a few feet and then started going forward.""

Perzana said that he heard Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's allegation that the woman was trying to run down an officer. He said it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

""When she started driving forward, there were, I think, three shots from the person who was originally by the driver’s side door, not the person who had been pulling on the handle,"" he said.

He added that ""there was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through.""

Perzana said an ambulance arrived around 10 minutes later, but could not reach the vehicle because of ICE vehicles in the street.

""There were probably six or seven, sort of parked all askew...blocking traffic,"" he said. ""They didn’t not, you know, clear the way for the ambulance so, some people approached on foot.""

Aidan’s wife, Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood for more than two years and ""love it."" She did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on her street, but said she does have many ""Latinx"" neighbors.

""We are really happy here,"" she said. ""We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue. There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards. ""

Today's shooting is not Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's first experience leading the city through an officer-involved shooting under public scrutiny.

Frey came to the national spotlight in 2020 when George Floyd was murdered by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd's death was initially described as a medical emergency, but bystander video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck while the man gasped, saying he could not breathe.

The case sparked renewed anger over police brutality and a racial reckoning that swept the U.S., sparking protests in the Twin Cities that eventually ignited across the country. Protests in Minneapolis at the time were fraught with physical violence between residents and police.

During a news conference today, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights safely and peacefully.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrests by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there today.

This week, DHS sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the ICE shooting in Minneapolis, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

Brandon Hewitt, who is new to the neighborhood, said he was getting up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard three gunshots. He then looked outside and said he saw that a vehicle had crashed.

“I’m pretty right-leaning, but seeing this, this is not what you need to do,” he told KARE. “It’s not how to do it. It’s not how we’re supposed to do things around here in America.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city.

“What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,” he said at a news conference after the shooting. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”

Frey said that there was little he could say to improve the situation, but he had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

“To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,” the mayor said. “We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety, and you are doing the opposite.”

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis today after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Video footage from NBC affiliate KARE 11 of Minneapolis showed a burgundy SUV with what appeared to be a bullet hole in the windshield. The vehicle had crashed into a light pole. It’s not clear to whom the SUV belongs or from where the bullet was shot.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the woman who was killed of weaponizing her vehicle, ""attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them."" McLaughlin said in a statement that ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when the 37-year-old woman was shot.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-3x2-minnesota-shooting-scene-vl-211p-6a7722.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 19:58:12.196444

Former San Francisco Judge Dana Leigh Marks said the move to shutter the largest of three immigration courts serving Northern California feels like a step toward dismantling the path to asylum entirely.
The San Francisco court, which is the largest of three that hear cases from the Central Valley to the Oregon border, has a backlog of 120,000 cases.
“For a long time, it has been seen as a thorn in the side of more restrictive immigration policies,” Marks said.
“The only rationale I can find to justify closing the San Francisco court instead of relocating it in the close area … is that it’s an effective way to close down a more liberal court.” KQED’s Tyche Hendricks contributed to this report.","San Francisco’s main immigration court is set to close by the end of the year, driving former judges and advocates to worry that it’s part of an effort by the Trump administration to drastically remake and shrink the overburdened immigration system in the Bay Area and beyond.

Former judges told KQED that staffers were informed Tuesday that the court would not renew its lease at 100 Montgomery St., where the majority of the Bay Area’s asylum cases are heard.

The court, which began 2025 with 21 judges, now has just four remaining after 13 were fired and four more retired at the end of the year, which some attorneys told KQED they were pressured into. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired since last January.

Former San Francisco Judge Dana Leigh Marks said the move to shutter the largest of three immigration courts serving Northern California feels like a step toward dismantling the path to asylum entirely.

“The system is bleeding from 1,000 small cuts,” she said. “It seems to me like what the current administration is trying to do is maximize the dysfunction in order to allow a change in the law by Congress. To eventually eliminate the system and eliminate the due process that immigrants get.”

Marks said she’s heard from current immigration attorneys that when the judge presiding over their client’s cases has been fired, their court dates have been removed from the docket and pushed back by up to three or four years.

Former Judge Arwen Swink, who was fired from San Francisco’s bench last month, told KQED that current staffers got an email confirming that the Montgomery Street court would shutter by January 2027, when the court’s current lease ends. She and three other former judges, who spoke with KQED on the condition of anonymity to protect their sources from retaliation, said the court is aiming to end operations at the site as soon as the summer and plans to consolidate remaining staff in the Bay Area’s other immigration courthouse in Concord.

The Rev. Leah Martens, who has been attending vigils outside the nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in recent months as part of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, said the news on Tuesday felt like “a gut punch.”

“It feels like this administration is continuing to make moves that make it harder for people to find legal pathways to be secure,” she told KQED. “It feels like that’s not the goal anymore.”

Martens said the immigration system is already backlogged, and she worries that shutting down the city’s main court will only further slow immigrants’ cases.

The San Francisco court, which is the largest of three that hear cases from the Central Valley to the Oregon border, has a backlog of 120,000 cases.

Another in Concord, which opened in 2024 and was expected to grow to a similar size, has just seven judges. Sacramento’s smaller court shrunk from six to three judges last year. The two locations are responsible for around 90,000 more cases.

On Wednesday morning, the line of people waiting for check-in appointments outside the ICE field office on Sansome Street, about half a mile from the court, extended down the block and around the corner. Martens said some of the people standing outside the federal building, holding folders of legal paperwork and bundled against the early morning cold, had also been lined up Monday or Tuesday but hadn’t made it through the long, slow-moving queue.

The Rev. Deborah Lee, who heads the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, said she sees the closure of San Francisco’s court as part of a series of moves by the Trump administration to dismantle the immigration judicial system.

Last spring, ICE officers began arresting immigrants outside courtrooms where they had mandatory hearings, a tactic that was previously unprecedented. DOJ attorneys would move to have asylum-seekers’ cases dismissed, while officers waited in courtroom hallways to take them into detention if they were. The DOJ used similar tactics to detain immigrants who reported to ICE check-in appointments like those held at 630 Sansome St.

If asylum-seekers fail to appear for a mandatory hearing or appointment, their case can be dropped altogether.

Marks said prosecutors have also increasingly moved to deny cases before immigrants have a hearing and offer asylum cooperation agreements, under which people can go to a country other than their home country if they agree to leave the U.S., without taking the necessary legal steps.

“What this current administration has been doing is almost like a smash-and-grab robbery. They’re not following any of the established rules … providing flimsy and transparent justifications, or just disregarding the rules,” Marks said. “Some might not hold up with litigation, but they aren’t waiting.”

Milli Atkinson, who directs the Immigrant Legal Defense Program at the Bar Association of San Francisco, said it is possible that the DOJ could shift some hearings in the city to three courtrooms in the Sansome Street building, which is federally owned and not expected to close. But no judges are located at the site, and the communication sent to Montgomery Street staff suggests that operations will be consolidated to Concord.

“Logistically, it’s just going to be a nightmare,” she said. “It is going to be chaotic for several months, where people are not going to know if they have a hearing scheduled, where the hearing is scheduled, who their judge is, if their case is going to be moved.”

Amanda Maya, the asylum program director at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, said the move also backpedals on the goal of opening Concord’s court: easing access for immigrants in the East Bay and Central Valley.

“It was an incredible development for people who were already in the East Bay and were having to travel to San Francisco, where it didn’t make sense, or people in the Central Valley who unfortunately don’t have an immigration courthouse,” Maya said. “But now we’ve created the problem that existed, but for people on the Peninsula or people who live in the South Bay.”

Maya also said that many of the Bay Area’s legal resource centers and nonprofits are based in San Francisco because of its proximity to the court. Programs like the Bar Association of San Francisco’s Federal Pro Bono Project, through which immigrants can get legal advice from attorneys, have spent years building relationships with the city’s judges and court staff.

Marks said it’s not unheard of for the immigration court to move to a new location when its lease expires, but she said eliminating what has been perceived as one of the most liberal courts nationwide feels calculated.

“For a long time, it has been seen as a thorn in the side of more restrictive immigration policies,” Marks said. “The only rationale I can find to justify closing the San Francisco court instead of relocating it in the close area … is that it’s an effective way to close down a more liberal court.”

Gardner Street within the municipal boundaries of West Hollywood.

The City’s law enforcement partners at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department West Hollywood Station have confirmed that Deputies responded midday to that block following resident reports of men in two large SUVs having detained an individual from a small pickup truck, which was then left unattended. Deputies remained with the vehicle until a family member responded and took possession of the vehicle.

According to the West Hollywood Station, there is no confirmation from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that it conducted the detention.

The City of West Hollywood unequivocally condemns such actions. They are not only disruptive and hostile, they also represent discriminatory assaults on our communities.

Mr. Mamdani’s pick to lead the city’s Commission on Human Rights, Christine Clarke, is another step toward filling out his new administration. The commission investigates complaints of unlawful incidents of discrimination and educates the public about the nuances of New York’s human rights law.

The appointment of Ms. Clarke, the chief of litigation and advocacy at Legal Services NYC, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to low-income New Yorkers, also gave Mr. Mamdani the opportunity to lean into the issue of income inequality that was central to his campaign for mayor.

“For nearly 82 years, no matter its name, the City Commission on Human Rights has done the vital work of protecting human rights in our city, of delivering justice,” Mr. Mamdani said, speaking from an area in Jackson Heights, Queens, that is known as Diversity Plaza because of the vast range of countries represented by its stores and vendors. “That work has never been more important, and the person entrusted to lead it has never been more important either.”

At Legal Services NYC, Ms. Clarke worked on a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city filed by several survivors of domestic violence who claimed the police had violated their civil rights by denying them interpreters.

The ensuing settlement called for new practices for the Police Department, and mandated training for officers responding to domestic violence cases involving people who are not proficient in English.

Mr. Mamdani and Ms. Clarke vowed on Wednesday to beef up what is commonly regarded by critics as a lackluster commission, low on funds and slow to respond to discrimination cases. Last month, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, issued an audit that found the commission had “allowed some housing discrimination cases to sit at times for years without resolution.”

In response to a reporter’s question, Ms. Clarke acknowledged “enormous delays in the Commission on Human Rights” and vowed to speed up its output.

DHS says driver was trying to ram agents

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that an ICE agent fatally shot a person in a vehicle, claiming that the person was trying to ram agents.

""Our officer followed his training and did exactly what he was trained to do,"" United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.

The agency's full statement can be read below:

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Operations are set to continue in the city and state despite the ongoing investigation, Noem said.

""We're still out on the streets doing our work,"" she said. ""We are going to continue to operate in Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota.""

Noem said the agent who shot and killed Good was taken to the hospital, treated by a doctor and released to spend time with his family. She did not provide any details about possible injuries or how long he may be out.

She added that the same agent was previously in a similar situation where he was ""hit and drug"" by a car. She didn't provide other details.

Videos circulating online show moments before and after the shooting

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot a driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out using an expletive. One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV. The driver appears to slowly back, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said at the Wednesday press conference that he had viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

""The narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative,"" Frey said. ""It is not true.""

City officials said there was no indication the woman who was shot was the target of any law enforcement activity.

Leaders, Minnesota residents respond to ICE shooting

At a separate press conference later Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said the state was prepared for protests he expects to take place in the coming days, and urged Minnesotans to ""not take the bait"" from the Trump administration to engage in violence.

""If you protest, and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully as you always do,"" Walz said. ""We can't give them what they want. The hearts and minds of the people in this state are on our side. To Americans, I ask you this: Please stand with Minneapolis. To Minnesotans, know that our administration is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.""

The governor, who announced a day earlier that he would not be seeking reelection, said he was afraid the federal government's actions would lead to escalation.

""We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety; that someone was going to get hurt,"" Walz said. ""Just yesterday, I said exactly that. What we're seeing is a consequence of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV. And today that recklessness caused someone their life.""

Reporters in the area saw more than 100 federal agents descend on the scene near 34th Street and Portland Avenue after the shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

According to KARE11 reporters at the scene, a crashed car at the intersection had a bullet hole in the front windshield on the driver's side. Two other cars have wreckage damage. Near the scene, protesters began chanting anti-ICE slogans.

A tense interaction nearby saw protesters throwing snowballs at federal officials. The immigration officials responded with pepper spray and paintballs, which are considered non-lethal crowd control devices.

The incident happened during what the Department of Homeland Security called its ""largest immigration operation ever."" An estimated six hundred agents and investigators are examining alleged fraud in the state.

State Senator Omar Fateh said in a social media post that he's received reports that a doctor at the scene was denied the ability to provide lifesaving CPR by federal law enforcement. In a press conference, Frey said he could not verify this witness account.

A witness showed KARE reporters what appeared to be video of responders attempting to resuscitate someone.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara previously said his department does not enforce immigration laws, according to KARE 11. On Tuesday, he said he appointed a designated supervisor and placed additional officers on standby around the clock due to concerns of potential unrest.

“Every day for the last several weeks has been a challenge,” O’Hara said, adding that his greatest concern is the potential for unrest or a tragedy in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. He asked protesters to remain peaceful and urged federal agents to conduct their work “professionally and lawfully.”

According to DHS, agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Minnesota, including 150 in Minneapolis on Monday.

In a statement on his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump said he had seen at least one of the videos showing the Minneapolis shooting.

""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" he wrote. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.""

The president said he blamed the incident, and others like it over the past several months, on left-leaning protesters interfering with ICE operations.

""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,"" Trump wrote. ""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.

Large crowds chanting anti-ICE slogans formed near the scene of the shooting, local news outlets showed.

Anti-ICE protests

There have been passionate protests in some cities against the immigration enforcement operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are ""millions"" of undocumented migrants.

The DHS called the violence a ""direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers.""

The shooting reportedly occurred at 34th Street and Portland Avenue in Minneapolis. Nearby, ICE officers were seen pepper-spraying and shoving protesters during immigration enforcement operations in South Minneapolis, footage broadcast by local CBS affiliate WCCO showed.

Dozens of protesters and bystanders were seen on the scene after the incident. ""There's no way whatever this person did that they deserved to be killed for it,"" one bystander told the broadcaster.

Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants top priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas. During his campaign, Trump likened undocumented migrants to ""animals,"" frequently linking them, without evidence, to criminal behavior.

ICE – which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump – has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants during the Republican's second term.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged for the public to ""remain calm"" as his team gathered information on the shooting.

Trump's White House called Minneapolis Mayor Frey a ""scumbag"" for comments after the shooting in which he accused ICE of ""causing chaos and distrust.""

DHS practices, budget questioned DHS received billions for immigration enforcement in last year's tax and spending cuts package passed by congressional Republicans.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump defended a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis Wednesday, while congressional Democrats universally condemned the action.

Video obtained by the Minnesota Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding the driver of a maroon SUV get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting.

But Trump wrote on social media that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”

“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” Trump wrote.

Minnesota’s Democratic congressional delegation, and other Democrats in Washington, D.C., strongly condemned the incident and questioned the subsequent comments from the administration.

“We need full transparency and an investigation of what happened, and I am deeply concerned that statements made by DHS do not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts,” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the state’s senior senator, said in a statement.

A statement from several Minneapolis City Council members identified the victim as Renee Nicole Good, 37. A photo of the SUV shows several stuffed animals hanging out of the glove compartment.

Trump, GOP back officer

Congressional Republicans largely backed Trump’s version of events, calling the shooting self-defense and blaming Democrats for rhetoric they said inspired violence.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the woman tried to run over the agent.

“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” McLaughlin said. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the victim a “domestic terrorist.”

House Republican Whip Tom Emmer gave his support to the ICE officer.

“Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals,” he said in a statement. “May God bless and protect them in their efforts. Shame on the elected officials who endanger these agents by spewing lies and hateful rhetoric.”

Dems call for investigation

Democrats on Capitol Hill denounced the attack and the administration’s response.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for the ICE officer who shot the woman to be criminally investigated.

“There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing,” Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life.”

Minnesota Democrats said the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities had heightened tensions.

“For weeks, Donald Trump has directed ICE and DHS agents to racially profile and arrest Minnesotans in their homes, their workplaces, and on our streets,” Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said in a statement, adding that more than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in the state.

“Trump’s reckless and dangerous immigration policies do nothing to make us safer,” she continued. “Today in Minneapolis, these actions resulted in a masked federal agent fatally shooting a woman in the head.”

Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said the woman fatally shot by an ICE officer was a U.S. citizen. She called for ICE to leave Minnesota.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress and whose district includes the site of the shooting, said the woman was a legal observer, which is a neutral third party who attends protests or other public demonstrations to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.

“ICE’s actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible,” Omar said.

DHS practices, budget questioned

DHS received billions for immigration enforcement in last year's tax and spending cuts package passed by congressional Republicans. The funding can be used for hiring new ICE officers and detention and removal of immigrants.

On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, doubling from 10,000 agents to 22,000.

A top Senate Democratic appropriator, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, wrote on social media that “Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn’t restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency.”

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement that he was concerned the aggressive DHS practices will lead to more tragedies.

“All evidence indicates that hiring standards have been lowered, training is inadequate, and internal controls are insufficient,” he said. “These conditions have allowed agents to operate without proper oversight, and, in some cases, unlawfully.”

Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego also criticized the hiring practices of ICE, specifically calling out White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy.

“What happened is a disgrace and we need an investigation immediately,” Gallego said on social media. “It's clear that that agent didn't have the proper training, and that's because Stephen Miller is going full speed ahead to hire as many agents as possible.”

Day care investigation

The federal immigration operation in Minneapolis began last month but intensified this week after a right-wing influencer reported day care centers run by members of the Somali community as fraudulent.

In response, the Trump administration directed states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers and Noem has zeroed in on the city, which has a large Somali community, for immigration enforcement.

The shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent occurred Wednesday morning in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis as federal immigration officials conducted a sweeping operation, Gov. Tim Walz said.

The Minneapolis County Council released a statement Wednesday afternoon that said Good, 37, was the woman who was shot and killed. Good's family confirmed to KUSA that she's from the Colorado Springs area.

Earlier in the day, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said it didn't appear she was the target of any law-enforcement activity.

The Minneapolis City Council released a statement saying Good was ""out caring for her neighbors"" when she was killed.

“This morning an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a member of our community"" the statement says in part, KARE11 reports. ""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government. Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

O'Hara said the woman was in her vehicle, which was blocking the street. Video circulating on social media shows ICE agents approaching the car on foot and the woman beginning to drive away as an agent yanks on her door handle. At least two shots were fired into the vehicle, which then crashed.

A red SUV was visible at the scene with a bullet hole through the driver's side windshield. The SUV was smashed into a light pole, with two damaged cars parked nearby, KARE11 reported.

O'Hare said that the woman was taken to a hospital, and her spouse has arrived there.

""This is a very tragic situation where a woman lost her life."" O'Hara said.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement the woman was among a group of protesters and attempted to hit ICE agents with her vehicle ""in an attempt to kill them."" She said an ICE agent fired shots at the woman, who was hit and killed.

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot the driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out, using an expletive.

One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV.

The driver appears to slowly back up, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said he viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

ICE agents who were injured are expected to make a full recovery, McLaughlin said. She did not say how many agents were injured or what their injuries are.

DHS said on Tuesday that it had launched an immigration enforcement operation with 2,000 agents, tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The full picture of what exactly happened is still coming into focus, including through eyewitness accounts and videos. But federal officials are describing the killing in starkly different terms from state and local officials.

How did the shooting occur?

Minneapolis Police Department chief Brian O'Hara said officers responded to a report Wednesday morning of shots being fired in an incident involving federal law enforcement.

The city's officers found a woman with a gunshot wound to the head who was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, the police chief said in a news conference Wednesday.

Watch the news conference in the player above.

O'Hara offered a preliminary picture of what happened: The woman was in her car and blocking a roadway. A federal officer then approached the motorist on foot while the vehicle began to drive away. At least two shots were fired and then the vehicle crashed alongside the roadway.

Neither the ICE officer nor the victim have been identified by authorities. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the woman was 37 years old. O'Hara said she appeared to be a middle-aged white woman.

The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that the victim's mother identified her as Renee Nicole Good, saying she was ""loving, forgiving and affectionate.""

There was ""nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation,"" the police chief said.

Videos taken by bystanders and posted to social media show two officers approaching a car that is stopped across the middle of a snowy and icy road. One officer attempts to open the driver's side door and reaches into the vehicle as it starts reversing. A third officer with his gun drawn crosses in front of the car as it moves away from the agents. That officer, who appears to be knocked backward but not hit, opens fire on the vehicle. The car then speeds toward the curb, crashing into parked vehicles.

What the Trump administration is saying

The Department of Homeland Security said the shooting was an act of self-defense. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told PBS News in a statement that the ICE officer fired defensively, ""fearing for his life"" and the lives of others.

Speaking from Texas, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem likened the incident to an ""act of domestic terrorism"" against ICE officers by a motorist who tried to run them over with her vehicle.

""An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot to protect himself and the people around him,"" she told reporters.

President Donald Trump weighed in on the shooting on social media, suggesting the driver was ""very disorderly"" and ""viciously ran over the ICE Officer, [sic]"" who he said was recovering in the hospital after the incident. DHS' McLaughlin said in the statement that ""the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.""

What Minnesota officials are saying

Watch the clip in the player above.

Frey strongly rebuked the federal characterization of events, saying that he had viewed footage of the incident.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" he said. ""I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t.""

A reporter asked Frey whether the woman was driving her car as a ""weapon"" toward the ICE agent. The mayor said that didn't appear to be the case.

Frey said the ICE agent was ""recklessly using power"" that resulted in a person's death.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said.

He then said he had a message to ICE: ""Get the f**k out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.""

Gov. Tim Walz addressed Minneapolis residents in a later news conference, saying, ""I feel your anger.""

The governor, who mentioned the protests following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd throughout Wednesday's news conference, then asked for any protests to remain peaceful. ""They want a show,"" he said of the Trump administration. ""We can't give it to them.""

He then addressed the Trump administration.

""We do not need any further help from the federal government. To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: You've done enough,"" the governor added.

Why is ICE in Minneapolis?

Minneapolis is the latest major U.S. city to see a surge of immigration enforcement activity. The Trump administration sent more than 2,000 federal agents to the area earlier this week. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told Newsmax that this is the ""largest immigration operation ever.""

The deployment followed mounting scrutiny from federal investigators over fraud allegations targeting Somali child care providers in the state. Trump has also singled out Somalis in his anti-immigrant rhetoric.

In his social media post, Trump claimed that the ""Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting"" law enforcement officers and ICE agents on a ""daily basis.""

Walz, who had called the deployment a ""war"" against Minnesota, responded to DHS' social media post about the shooting, saying he had viewed video of the incident.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" the governor wrote. ""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

Wolff,,,,,https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/did-supreme-court-just-signal-fate-trumps-tariffs,"The Supreme Court concluded that the government had not shown that this statute authorized the president to deploy the Guard in Chicago.
In the tariffs case, it is the potential trespass on the powers of the Congress.
In the tariffs case, it is the president assuming powers clearly assigned by the Constitution to the Congress.
This deference may be under reconsideration, given the latest ruling in the Illinois Guard case.
In both the Illinois Guard case and the “reciprocal tariff” case, the question of proportionality arises.","Card players recognize the signs of a “tell,” a player’s demeanor that telegraphs intent for the next hand. Just before Christmas, the Supreme Court in Trump v. Illinois made a procedural ruling that prevented the Trump administration from deploying Illinois National Guard troops in Chicago. Could this decision signal that the Court may rule against the administration in the Trump tariff cases?

The stay blocking deployment of troops in Chicago was upheld by a 6-3 vote. It centered on interpreting 10 U.S.C. §12406(3)—a statute the administration invoked to federalize (activate) the National Guard to enforce federal law. The Supreme Court concluded that the government had not shown that this statute authorized the president to deploy the Guard in Chicago. It cited the statutory requirement that that the president first be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws”—a condition it found was not met or shown. The Court’s majority (Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting) defined “regular forces” as the regular US military. Federal troops generally cannot be used for domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by Congress (e.g., the Insurrection Act, pointing to limits under the Posse Comitatus Act). The Court found that there was no showing that “regular forces” could not execute the laws and that the legal conditions for military use had not been fulfilled.

The president’s use of “reciprocal” tariffs on imports of almost everything from everywhere, first announced on April 2 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), would seem to be as remote a fact pattern that could be imagined from the issues in the Illinois Guard case. But there are a few striking parallels in the two sets of facts and perhaps some similarities in the reasoning. In both cases the president is claiming powers without limit, powers that intrude on the domains of other parts of the American government. Both cases involve the separation of powers—in the Guard case, it is the vertical separation between the states and the federal government. In the tariffs case, it is the potential trespass on the powers of the Congress.

Here is a breakdown of the similarities in the legal considerations before the Court.

Intrusion on powers entrusted by the Constitution to other parts of the government

Although not unknown—for example, in civil rights cases—federalizing a state’s guard over the governor’s objection is one of the most intrusive actions the federal government can take against a state. Illinois argues that accepting the government’s position for federalizing the Guard would allow the president to regularly commandeer state military forces for routine crime control even when state authorities were functioning and opposed the action. This would dramatically weaken the balance struck between federal and states’ police powers. There would be no limits. See brief of the State of Illinois.

Similarly, by declaring an emergency under IEEPA, any time that the president wishes to apply a tariff, he could do so when conducting normal commercial relations with other countries. In the tariffs case, it is the president assuming powers clearly assigned by the Constitution to the Congress. The president’s “emergency” power to deploy tariffs would have no effective limits, as only a vote in both Houses by a two-thirds supermajority could assure the end of an emergency and the removal of the tariffs the president declared. See V.O.S. Selections v. Trump and the oral argument at the Supreme Court on the cases.

Stretching statutory authority beyond its text

10 U.S.C. §12406 allows federalization of the Guard in limited circumstances. Detaching the statute from its preconditions, especially the requirement that the president be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws,” would convert an exceptional power into a general domestic policing authority. In other words, the statute was being read as: “If the president thinks it useful, he may federalize the guard.” Congress did not write §12406 that broadly.

IEEPA, a sanctions statute, does not even include tariffs in its list of means to be used. It refers to unusual circumstances of a foreign threat that constitutes an emergency. Trade deficits are neither unusual nor clearly an emergency. Tariffs might be used to enforce a trade sanction but not converted into a general domestic revenue raising or even retaliatory authority.

Bypassing existing authority

When presidents deploy military force domestically, they rely on the Insurrection Act, which has explicit triggers (e.g., insurrection, obstruction of federal law, deprivation of constitutional rights). The Act carries political and legal accountability and has a well-understood history of precedents. It has been used in limited circumstances to maintain order in Little Rock, AR, when ending segregation in the public schools in the 1950s, for example, and in the face of widespread riots.

The reciprocal tariffs are an end-run around Congress’s chosen framework. The Congress provided authority to deal with balance of payments emergencies (limited to a 15 percent tariff and 150 days duration). There are separate authorities to deal with threats to national security (Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) and to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices (Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974). During most of the last 90 years, there has been delegated trade agreement authority to modify tariffs. That authority expired during the presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Expansion of presidential powers

What would come next if the Court approved the government’s theory in upholding deployment of the Guard? Could the Guard be federalized for fighting crime, enforcing immigration or other laws, or dealing with political unrest generally? Could a standing alternative police force be created? Could invoking emergency powers be normalized if this deployment of the Guard was normalized?

Similarly, if the Court upholds the tariffs, what constraints exist on the president’s future use of the power to tax trade if the “reciprocal” tariffs he imposed are allowed to stand?

Conclusion: Proportionality

The Roberts Court has been very favorable to the executive branch, including allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) broad scope to enforce immigration laws, in granting the president immunity from criminal acts when conducting the business of government, and in a host of other ways. This deference may be under reconsideration, given the latest ruling in the Illinois Guard case. The stay on the Guard may be a harbinger of a shift of attitude for a new majority of the court. Although the executive has been given extensive support from the Court to act as it wishes, there are still and ought to be constitutional limits. The Illinois decision may be instructive: The reasoning it applied is a strong mandate for returning the Constitution to its place in ensuring balance among co-equal branches of the legislative and the executive, with the Court sitting as the arbiter that the respective roles will be respected.

One of the most important powers the Constitution grants to Congress is the power to impose tariffs, the power to tax. The entire structure of government, the system of checks and balances among the branches, can readily be undermined if the president is allowed to exercise unrestricted power to raise revenue through imposing tariffs.

In both the Illinois Guard case and the “reciprocal tariff” case, the question of proportionality arises. Is the threat clearly of so great a magnitude—whether civil unrest in the former case, or external threats of economic harm in the latter—that sweeping powers should be assumed as intentionally granted to the executive by the Congress? The cases could not be superficially more disparate but raise a similar question. How much authority is acceptable to be transferred from other parts of the nation’s governance to the executive?",https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/2026-01/RC2HQHAAS7CQ.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 17:58:43.618584

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen.

Immigration authorities accused the victim, who the Minnesota Star Tribune identified as Renee Nicole Good, of trying to run over officers with her car. In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump defended the ICE agent who shot the victim, saying the agent “seems to have shot her in self defense.”

In a post on X, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith said the driver was a U.S. citizen.

“I’m gathering information, but the situation on the ground is volatile,” Smith said. “ICE should leave now for everyone’s safety. Please be safe Minneapolis.”

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey posted on social media, referring to ICE.

During a press event Wednesday afternoon, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he had issued a “warning order” to the Minnesota National Guard — though the Guard has not been activated — to protect Minnesotans. He blamed the Trump administration for operations that endanger the public, and went on to call on residents in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland to “stand with us.”

“This was so preventable. So unnecessary,” he said. “Maybe we’re at the McCarthy moment. Do you have no decency?”

Chicago had similar shootings involving federal agents

Wednesday’s deadly shooting follows similar incidents reported in the Chicago area during Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation campaign. In one raid, a man was killed, and in another a woman was injured.

Silverio Villegas González, a father and cook originally from Mexico, was shot at “close range” as he allegedly tried to flee from ICE agents who sought to stop his car on Sept. 12 in suburban Franklin Park.

Villegas González was shot in his neck and taken to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, where he was placed on a breathing tube before being pronounced dead less than an hour later, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. A toxicology report showed he had cocaine in his system at the time of the shooting.

Shortly after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported an agent was “seriously injured” when he was “dragged a significant distance” by Villegas González’s car as he fled a stop. DHS officials said the agent had opened fire, fearing for his life.

But body camera footage first obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times shows the federal agent telling local police he was “dragged a little bit.” Speaking over the radio, his partner relays the agent suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands.”

Villegas González had no criminal history, but DHS has said he had “a history of reckless driving” and was in the country without legal status.

A month later, Marimar Martinez, 30, was shot several times for allegedly tailing a Chevrolet Tahoe driven by Border Patrol agent Charles Exum. Martinez allegedly boxed it in and ultimately collided with it.

Exum opened fire, striking Martinez five times, leaving her with seven gunshot wounds. The shooting drew about 100 protesters to the Brighton Park neighborhood, who were met with pepper balls and tear gas deployed by federal agents.

Martinez was charged with assault, but federal prosecutors later dropped the case.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9744c4a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+193/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2Fc0%2F4a9ebbed4fee9a0b76f6882912f4%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:58:39.605314

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist when she allegedly tried to run over law enforcement officers during an immigration crackdown in the city, authorities said Wednesday.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot the woman in her vehicle in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey said on social media.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

“We’ve been trying to live life as fully as possible in light of the fear and anxiety that we feel,” said the Rev. Hierald Osorto, pastor at St. Paul’s-San Pablo Lutheran Church, which has a predominantly Latino congregation in the area.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noise-making devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

On Tuesday night, the Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session for about 100 people who were willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement operation.

“I feel like I’m an ordinary person, and I have the ability do something so I need to do it,” Mary Moran told KMSP-TV.

These bonds, ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, target select applicants from ""high-risk"" nations for short-term B-1/B-2 visitor visas, refundable only upon full compliance or denial. This Policy transforms lawful travel into a financial privilege, disproportionately excluding poorer, majority non-white populations and entrenching a mobility apartheid that raises profound Human Rights alarms.​

Policy Mechanics and Historical Lineage

The Policy originated as a 2025 State Department pilot addressing elevated visa overstay rates and weak document security, now encompassing 38 states after incorporating 25 new ones, with Africa hit hardest at over 20 countries plus Venezuela. Consular officers impose these sums—often dwarfing years of per-capita income—rendering entry a liquidity test for ordinary citizens.

""The bond scheme is intended to deter visa overstays and ensure 'compliance' with the terms of short-term visas,""

officials maintain, grounding it in Department of Homeland Security overstay analyses.​

Integrated into President Donald Trump's second-term framework, the regime pairs with biometric upgrades and rigorous ""public charge"" evaluations to constrict migration pathways. Its selective application—

""only to some applicants deemed higher overstay risk""

—fosters nationality-based profiling, laced with class and racial undertones, particularly evident in Venezuela amid economic sanctions and geopolitical strains.​

Economic Ripples and Social Exclusion

High bond thresholds threaten to slash tourism, family visits, and business exchanges from listed nations, where scraping together thousands in liquid funds remains elusive for most.

""The high bond levels are expected to depress tourism flows, reduce in-person business links, and complicate family visits from affected countries,""

especially burdensome for African states now numbering 24 on the roster. Diaspora ties weaken, remittances falter, and cultural connections fray under this Policy's weight.​

Such exclusion codifies global hierarchies, where Northern travelers glide unimpeded while Southern ones hit paywalls. Critics invoke ""mobility apartheid,"" akin to historical pass systems, as

""the list largely consists of Global South countries with lower income levels,""

perpetuating unequal mobility through financialized gates. Venezuela's designation, set against ""heightened tensions,"" blends migration controls with broader U.S. pressure tactics.​

The Racialised Underpinnings of Financialised Borders

Financial barriers racialise U.S. borders by proxy, as the roster fixates on Africa and Latin America—majority non-white regions—while sparing Europe and affluent peers despite comparable overstay data. In low-income contexts like Senegal or Nigeria, a $5,000 bond equates to multiple years' earnings, accessible solely to elites.

""Costly visa deposits turn lawful travel into privilege for the wealthy,""

amplifying disparities where mobility tracks wealth often aligned with racial privilege.​

This Policy echoes entrenched patterns, from quota eras to profiling spikes, encoding bias via discretion and risk metrics.

""Rights groups characterize the bonds as a form of 'pay-to-enter' migration control that deepens inequality in mobility,""

spotlighting Human Rights violations in access rationing. Venezuela's inclusion

""exposes political logic behind America’s expanded visa bonds,""

merging enforcement with foreign Policy aims.​

Broader Implications for Global Mobility Equity

The regime accelerates ""pay-to-play"" borders, layering onto digital visa tools and AI checks that already sideline the less affluent.

""Visa bonds export Washington’s migration anxieties onto poorer, dependent states,""

offloading costs while asserting dominance. Diplomatic strains emerge, potentially derailing trade with African Union members or hemispheric deals over Latin inclusions.​

U.S. economies suffer too—fewer visitors from Nigeria or Venezuela dent hospitality sectors in key cities. Yet the Policy delivers political dividends for Trump's base, prioritizing ""tough"" optics over equitable flows. Human Rights standards, from UN mobility pacts, clash with this tiered system, demanding scrutiny of its disparate impacts.​

Human Rights Critiques and Policy Pathologies

Human Rights advocates decry the bonds as discriminatory,

""warn[ing] the policy will effectively price out many ordinary travelers and small businesspeople, viewing it as a discriminatory barrier that falls overwhelmingly on poorer nations.""

By design, the Policy functions as exclusion, not enforcement, violating equality principles in global passage.

""US visa bonds weaponise financial barriers against Global South mobility,""

entrenching apartheid-like divides.​

Geopolitics infuses the Policy further: Venezuela and like cases serve sanction proxies, isolating foes under migration guise. This financial Policy tests international norms, inviting reciprocity or boycotts from the Global South.

Dismantling requires legislative caps, indigency waivers, or judicial probes into racial impacts. Global South coalitions could enact mirror Policies, pressuring equity. Awareness campaigns, hammering

Release of body camera footage up to FBI, Noem says

Noem says the FBI is leading the investigation into the events of the shooting. When asked whether body camera footage from the ICE agents would be released as part of it, she declined to answer, saying it was up to the FBI.

She reiterated the version of events told by federal officials today - that ICE agents were wrapping up another operation and heading back to the office when their vehicle got stuck in the snow.

While they were stuck, the woman blocked their paths and harassed them, Noem said.

Officer who opened fire was 'experienced' agent

Noem is repeatedly pressed about her comments that the officer who opened fire acted in ""self-defence"".

She says the officer is an ""experienced"" agent, but did not provide details on whether he had previously opened fired in the June incident where she says a car was also used as a ""weapon"".

Local officials 'refuse to protect Minnesotans', says Noem

Noem blames local Democratic leaders for not enforcing federal laws, making it necessary for federal officers to be in the city.

The mayor and governor ""refuse to protect Minnesotans, and instead choose to protect the criminals. That's why we're here,"" she claims.

Federal officers in the city are there to ""bring peace"" and have arrested 1,500 ""criminals"" in recent weeks in Minneapolis.

She also references recent fraud allegations made against the city's Somali immigrant community, which have helped fuel the federal crackdown in the city.

ICE agent was hit by a car last summer, says Noem

Noem says an ICE agent injured today was previously hit by a car in June.

He was injured then, too, she says.

""In fact, the very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June,"" says Noem.

""He sustained injuries at that time as well.""

Noem says 'mob of agitators' was harassing ICE agents

The incident began when law enforcement agents were attempting to remove an ICE vehicle that had gotten stuck in snow, says Noem.

""A mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began blocking them in,"" she says about the crowd that formed around the agents.

The woman, says Noem, was stalking and impeding officers, before making the decision to ""weaponise"" her vehicle in an effort to ""kill"" officers.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to speak shortly

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is in Minneapolis and is scheduled to hold a news conference in a few minutes.

The department oversees a variety of agencies, including immigration enforcement like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which was involved in the deadly shooting earlier in the day.

Noem has said the officer who opened fire was in fear for his life after the woman allegedly tried to use her vehicle as a weapon. She called the incident ""an act of domestic terrorism"".

What do ICE guidelines say when officers can use deadly force?

The shooting is expected to be heavily-scrutinised, and will certainly include a review of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy on when deadly force is permitted.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) falls under DHS, and is subject to the same rules, which were last updated in February 2023.

According to the DHS guidelines, ""deadly force must be objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the [law enforcement agent] at the time force is applied"".

Deadly force can only be used when the officer ""has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury"" to the officer or another person.

The rules add that deadly force ""shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject"" unless the person ""poses an imminent threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person"".

Agents are also ""prohibited from discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle unless the use of deadly force against the operator is justified under standards articulated elsewhere in this policy"".

Agents also must consider ""that hazards that may be posed"" by an out-of-control vehicle.

A state-led investigation of the shooting is already underway, according to Governor Tim Walz.

Minneapolis City Council says Renee Good was 'caring for her neighbors' when she was shot

The Minneapolis City Council shared a statement confirming the identity of the deceased woman as Renee Nicole Good and condemning ICE's actions in the city.

""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government,"" the statement reads. ""Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

The Council goes on to express support for immigrant communities in the city, and echoed calls from Mayor Jacob Frey for ICE agents to leave immediately.

""Minneapolis is resilient and will not back down as the federal government ramps up their attacks on our community,"" it said.

Analysis: Shooting being characterised in starkly different ways

Anthony Zurcher

North America correspondent

It is almost inevitable that the fatal shooting of a civilian in Minneapolis by an ICE officer will exacerbate already high tensions in the city.

Both the Trump administration and Democratic state and local officials are characterising the incident in starkly different ways.

Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, blamed a “professional agitator” and a “radical left movement of movement of violence and hate”. Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, offered an expletive laced call for immigration enforcement officials to leave the city.

Given that there is video of encounter, the American public will have the opportunity to pass its own judgement.

Minnesota has become a battleground on the immigration issue in recent months, as hundreds of immigration enforcement officials conduct operations in the area.

The increased enforcement comes as Donald Trump has derided the state’s large Somali immigrant population after members of the community were convicted of a widespread fraud in the distribution of federal Covid aid. Allegations of further corruption in state social services led to Tim Walz, the state’s Democratic governor, to abandon his re-election bid last week.

In a press conference earlier, Walz called the shooting “totally predictable” and “total avoidable” but warned against violent protests.

Minnesota Attorney General calls ICE deployment 'reckless'

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says he is monitoring reports of an ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis, in which a woman was killed.

He says reports are still coming in and there are still a lot that officials do not know, but he adds that President Donald Trump's decision to deploy thousands of armed ICE agents to the state ""is causing serious harm and spreading terror throughout our communities"".

He calls the move ""reckless"" and says it is a ""causal factor"" in Wednesday's incident, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.

""I will do everything I can to change this awful path we are on,"" he says, adding that he will work to hold anyone who broke the law accountable.

Shooting occurred near site of another high profile killing by law enforcement

During the news conference, Mayor Frey urged residents to protest peaceful saying the ""city has been through a lot"".

It was a veiled reference to other high profile incidents including the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man by a local police officer. Derek Chauvin was convicted on state charges and sentenced to over 22 years in prison.

Today's shooting occurred in the Powderhorn Park neighbourhood, a short distance from the intersection where Floyd was killed.

Video of the incident went viral sparking large scale protests against police brutality and racism locally before spreading across the nation and internationally.

Avelo Airlines is ending its deportation flights on Jan. 27 after months of harsh criticism and protests. The news comes after Delaware lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would strip state incentives from companies that support the massive nationwide immigration deportation efforts under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition has gathered at the Wilmington Airport since May to pressure the budget airline to drop the deportation flights. Activists in other states have also staged protests against the airline’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts across the country.

Avelo Communications Manager Courtney Goff said in a statement the company will end its participation in the nationwide Department of Homeland Security program and close its Arizona hub.

“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” she said.

Caritas Kerby, co-organizer of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition, said she believes the activism across the country led to Avelo’s decision to end its role in the controversial flights.

“I firmly believe that Avelo is folding due to the pressure campaigns all over the country,” she said. “It’s been months and months and months of hard work, late nights, meetings, coordination of a bunch of different organizations, and it’s feeling like a really big win.”

Goff denies that Avelo had a contract with the federal government to provide deportation flights, in spite of the company confirming to several media outlets in April that it agreed to provide ICE with flights to support “deportation efforts.”

“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Andrew Levy, Avelo Airlines founder and CEO, said in a statement published by Houston Public Media in April. “After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.”

Goff told WHYY News that Avelo was a subcontractor of CSI Aviation, which is currently the prime contractor for ICE deportation flights. According to the official tracker of federal government spending, CSI Aviation to date has been paid more than $560 million for ICE deportation flights.

Data from Human Rights First, a nonprofit group that tracks ICE flights, shows Avelo did fly deportation flights. The group’s report said the Trump administration conducted at least 11,192 ICE air charter flights from January through the end of November 2025, with Avelo serving about 17% of all November flights.

“We did do government flying, we are not disputing that,” Goff said in an emailed statement.

Proposed bills target Avelo Airlines’ economic incentives

A pair of Delaware lawmakers filed measures last month to address Avelo’s connection to ICE. The resolution and bill are sponsored by state Sen. Ray Seigfried, D-Talleyville, and Rep. Mara Gorman, D-Newark. Gorman said her constituents have been unhappy that Avelo has been profiting from these deportation flights. While Avelo did not run those flights out of Delaware, it did in other states, with a hub in Mesa, Arizona.

Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 would urge the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport, to prohibit agreements or incentives to businesses with ICE contracts that help deport individuals who have not been afforded sufficient due process protections.

Senate Bill 207 would remove a financial incentive for commercial airlines that operate ICE flights that include detainees who lack a valid judicial warrant or have not received required due process rights.

While the Senate bill’s language is broad, it would have potentially impacted Avelo’s jet fuel tax exemption and DRBA marketing incentives.

“We have every right to say how we’re going to provide financial incentives to an organization that’s violating a person’s due process,” Siegfried said.

In a statement, DRBA spokesperson James Salmon said that “while the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority.”

DRBA could make deal with second ICE contractor

The proposed legislation could prevent or eliminate incentives on a possible lease agreement between DRBA and Daedalus Aviation Group at the Wilmington Airport.

Last month, DHS paid Virginia-based Daedalus nearly $140 million to buy six Boeing 737s to use in deportation flights. Top company officials also head a separate company that has a nearly $1 billion contract to support “self deportations.” Daedalus did not respond to a request for comment.

Gorman said the bills are needed because Delawareans should know about companies operating inside the state that may be profiting off of the deportation of people without legal documentation who have been denied due process.

“[The resolution] asks DRBA to review the existing contracts, apply greater scrutiny to future agreements involving companies that conduct ICE deportation flights,” Gorman said. “And basically says that if public money is being used, the public deserves transparency and accountability about where those dollars are going.”

Members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition said they’re concerned the DRBA is trying to hide a possible deal with Daedalus Aviation because of its work helping ICE deport people who don’t have the proper documents to be in the country.

The DRBA is a bi-state government agency that owns and operates several transportation hubs across New Jersey and Delaware. It is run by a board of commissioners appointed by each state’s governor and is funded by tolls, user fees, ticket sales and retail transactions.

Rebekah Rodriguez, a member of the coalition, said she supports the lawmakers’ efforts.

“We think the legislation is important to increase transparency, to try to make sure that there’s no private profit off of the illegal deportations of our neighbors, and make sure that our institutions and representatives are being accountable,” she said.

DRBA pulls Daedalus agenda item after public scrutiny, revises agenda

The Delaware River and Bay Authority was expected to consider the Daedalus Aviation lease agreement at its Dec. 16 meeting.

Rodriguez said some activists showed up to the meeting to voice their concerns after seeing the lease agreement item on the agenda. She said the board quickly pulled it once the meeting started.

“Our community members showed up at that meeting and it was local clergy, parents and wage workers in our community,” she said. “When the DRBA saw us there, even though they are a public entity and they are answerable to the people of Delaware, they abruptly just took that resolution off and went into an executive session.”

WHYY News obtained the agenda that lists the lease agreement item from members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition. That agenda is no longer on the economic development agency’s website.

DRBA posted a revised agenda where the resolution number of the lease agreement now discusses employee retirement plans. Salmon did not respond to follow up questions from WHYY News.

Kerby said that while she considers the Avelo decision a win, her group will continue to pressure companies in the state not to do business with ICE.

“We are still going to be fighting in Delaware,” she said. “We have more work to do, but we’re celebrating how powerful we can be together.”

Delaware DOJ says DRBA not subject to state public records laws

It’s unclear if taking down the original agenda and replacing it with one that removes the mention of the lease agreement would violate Delaware open records laws.

That’s because the bi-state agency is not subject to either states’ Freedom of Information laws, according to a 2020 Delaware FOIA legal opinion. DOJ lawyers said the agency adopted its own FOIA policy in 1990. Questions to Salmon about the legality of altering the December agenda went unanswered.

“DRBA contends that it is not subject to unilateral legislation, as relevant caselaw and the language of the compact itself do not permit any additional duties or obligations be undertaken by DRBA without the express authorization of both states,” the DOJ opinion reads.

That legal decision said DRBA could be subject to either of the states’ FOIA laws by passing legislation. If the states chose to do so, the bill must contain a direct statement that they intend to amend the compact under which DRBA was created to make those laws apply.

On Wednesday, Noem argued that the water barrier would prevent migrant deaths by discouraging them from trying to cross the river.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the deployment of the barriers Wednesday during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley that included a roundtable discussion with U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel as well as ranchers whose property is often traversed by migrants moving north after crossing the border.

Standing before one of the buoys — large floating, cylindrical devices that can measure up to 15 feet long and four to five feet in diameter — Noem said 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and were beginning to be installed that day.

This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology. The projects are funded by the 2025 tax and spending megabill, which Trump named the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Noem touted the water barrier as a deterrent to people crossing the border illegally as well as drug smugglers and human traffickers.

Homeland Security and the Border Patrol are working with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission and the state of Texas to ensure proper installation of the buoys, Noem said.

The state of Texas is already familiar with using buoys to deter border crossings. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the installation of a 1,000-foot water barrier along the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass in 2023 as part of his mission to tighten border security, and an additional 1,000 feet of buoys after Trump took office in January 2025.

“Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, press secretary for Abbott, said in a statement Wednesday. “The floating marine barriers deployed by Texas have been a resounding success, and Governor Abbott is proud to work with the Trump Administration and Border Patrol to expand the program. ”

The buoys sparked protests from activists concerned about migrant safety and a complaint from the Mexican government alleging the buoys violated water treaties between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden sued Texas over the buoys, citing similar concerns. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the buoys to remain in place while the merits of the case move forward in a lower court. The state has argued it has the right to defend itself against an “invasion” of drug cartels.

Weeks after the buoy wall was installed in Eagle Pass, Mexican authorities reported a migrant had been found dead, caught on one of the floating spheres. On Wednesday, Noem argued that the water barrier would prevent migrant deaths by discouraging them from trying to cross the river.

“They’ll create a safer environment for agents on patrol, and securing our waterways not only protects Americans, it saves the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water,” Noem said.

The nonpartisan budget office projected that U.S. population will grow from 349 million people this year to 364 million people in 30 years, a 2.2% smaller gain than it had predicted at this time a year ago. In September, the office issued a revised demographics report that showed Trump’s plans for mass deportations and other strict immigration measures would result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next 10 years.

The country's total population is projected to stop growing in 2056 and remain roughly the same size as in the previous year, the CBO said. But without immigration, the population would begin to shrink in 2030 as deaths start to exceed births, making immigrants an increasingly important source of population growth, according to the report.

The figures released Wednesday are used by the CBO for budget projections and economic forecasts.

Even if the limits on immigration and increased deportations end with the Trump administration in three years, “it’s still a demographic shock,” said William Frey, a demographer at the centrist Brookings Institution.

Social Security and Medicare, which are already buckling under an aging population, will be under increasing pressure with even fewer than expected people in the labor force paying taxes. By the end of the decade, all of the nation’s baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, will be over age 65.

With fewer immigrants in the labor force and projections for U.S. fertility rates showing a long-term decline below replacement levels, ""that reduces the number of kids who are going to be born in that four-year period” of the second Trump administration, Frey said.

The latest numbers come as Trump has pushed for the largest mass deportation campaign in history. The CBO's numbers account for the success of those efforts in the first year of his second term in office.

The administration has used a variety of methods to remove people from the country, including through a visa ban on applications for immigrants from some countries and deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in U.S. cities to track down immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Trump’s tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, included roughly $150 billion to ramp up his deportation agenda over the next four years. This includes money for extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, building detention centers and adding thousands of law enforcement staff.

When it comes to estimating the nation’s population and future growth, immigration is always the wild card because it varies much more year to year than the number of births and deaths. Immigration has fueled U.S. population growth this decade because of an aging population and fertility lower than the replacement rate, with the number of deaths expected to start exceeding the number of births in about five years. The U.S. Census Bureau said that immigration increased by 2.8 million people in 2024 over the previous year.

Since Trump returned to office in January 2025, though, demographers and economists have struggled to decipher the impact of his policies on immigrant growth in the United States.

The bureau’s population estimates for last year have not been released yet, but the Current Population Survey estimated that the number of adult immigrants fell by 1.8 million people from January to November 2025. But those numbers have come under scrutiny, with some experts claiming they may reflect a decline in participation by immigrants in the survey rather than a dramatic drop in immigrant numbers.

Last September, the CBO reduced its immigration estimate for 2025 by 1.6 million people, and Pew last year estimated that the number of immigrants dropped by 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, from a high of 53.3 million immigrants in January 2025.

“These immigrants bring both themselves and the potential for children in the near term,” Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, said in an email. “They contribute both to the labor force through their arrival but also to the potential future growth of the US population through their potential to have children in the near term.”

Live Updates: Minnesota Officials Dispute Federal Account of Fatal ICE Shooting

Federal officials said a 37-year-old woman was trying to kill agents with a car in Minneapolis. City and state officials called that account false, demanding an end to the immigration crackdown.

Julie BosmanMitch Smith and

State and local officials demanded an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota after a federal officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Details remained in dispute, with President Trump saying the agents had acted in self-defense on social media, while state and local officials described federal accounts of the shooting with terms like “propaganda” and “garbage.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement that an agent had opened fire after a woman “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to kill federal officers, while the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, described the incident as “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Mayor Jacob Frey called that account “bullshit,” describing the shooting instead as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota posted on social media, “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

In an afternoon news conference, the governor said the shooting was predictable. “We have been warning for weeks that the Trump administration’s dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety,” Mr. Walz said, adding that it cost a person her life on Wednesday.

He directly addressed the president and Ms. Noem, telling them, “You’ve done enough.”

Here’s what we’re covering:

What videos show: Three videos of the shooting posted on social media and verified by The New York Times show two federal agents trying to get a woman to exit a vehicle that is partially blocking a street. The driver reverses, then pulls forward and begins to turn. A third agent pulls out a gun and fires a shot, then continues firing as the vehicle moves past him. Read more ›

Victim unidentified: City officials have not named the woman who was killed, though Mayor Frey cited her age. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes the shooting scene, described the person as a “legal observer.” The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said there was “nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.”

Calls for calm: Governor Walz asked for people to protest peacefully as about a thousand people gathered at the scene, chanting for immigration agents to leave and throwing snowballs at the police. Mr. Walz said the state’s National Guard troops were prepared to deploy if protests got out of hand. The shooting was about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020.

Federal crackdown: About 2,000 federal agents were expected to take part in the immigration enforcement operation, which could last for weeks, according to the Trump administration. Federal officials have framed the crackdown as a response to illegal immigration and widespread fraud in state social service systems. Read more ›

Other shootings: Federal agents enforcing immigration laws have been involved in several shootings in recent months, including in the Chicago and Los Angeles areas. At least 10 such shootings have been reported by news outlets since President Trump returned to office.

Video reporter

Videos circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times show the shooting of a woman by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, as well as the moments immediately before and after.

A maroon Honda Pilot is stopped on Portland Avenue, apparently blocking one lane of the snowy residential street. The driver rolls forward slightly, then stops and waves at approaching vehicles, signaling that they should drive past.

The videos show the driver wave one vehicle by. When a truck with flashing lights approaches, she waves again, but the truck stops and federal agents emerge.

Two step out and move toward the driver’s side. The agents tell the driver to get out.

One of the agents tries to open the driver’s side door and reaches through the window. A third agent crosses in front of the Honda, as the driver begins to reverse, turning to drive away from the agents.

Immediately after the Honda shifts from reverse into drive and begins to move ahead, that agent at the front of the vehicle, standing near the driver’s side headlight, pulls out a gun and aims at the driver.

The Honda moves forward, turning to the right. The agent aiming the gun fires, and continues to shoot as the vehicle moves past him.

The Honda accelerates, colliding with two parked vehicles and a light post. The agent who fired approaches the vehicle, then walks away and tells other agents to call 911.

The Minneapolis neighborhood where federal immigration officers fatally shot a woman on Wednesday is less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020.

The death of Mr. Floyd, on May 25, 2020, threw the community and the nation into a period of unrest, with widespread calls to view policing differently.

On Wednesday, hundreds were gathering once again, just blocks away from the site of Mr. Floyd’s killing, to protest the presence of the federal agents who shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car.

The tree-lined, mostly residential neighborhoods surrounding the scene are some of the most diverse in the city, with fairly large Hispanic and Black populations.

“We’re a really connected area, a community-centric neighborhood,” said Alex Stillman, 37, who lives near where the shooting took place and was inside when it happened. “Most people know each other or know how to get in contact with each other.”

For decades, the community has been home to working-class activists with far-left political leanings. Locals often brag that the biggest day of the year there is the May Day parade celebrating laborers.

Several years ago, a large homeless encampment sprawled across Powderhorn Park, a large park several blocks from Wednesday’s shooting. It has since been mostly cleared out by city and park officials. But both the encampment and heightened attention after Mr. Floyd’s death brought increased car traffic and crime into the neighborhood.

Federal agents have been stationed in Minneapolis since December and ramped up their presence this month, leading to clashes with immigration rights activists across the city.

Mitch Smith and

Local officials in Minneapolis called on federal forces to leave the city in a news conference on Wednesday afternoon after tensions flared when a woman was fatally shot during a confrontation with immigration agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, punctuated his call for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to get “out of Minneapolis” with an expletive, adding that the presence of the agents was sowing chaos in the city.

“People are being hurt,” he said. “Families are being ripped apart.”

Mr. Frey also urged residents to stay calm. He said that the Trump administration wanted to provoke a response that would justify a more forceful federal intervention and he called on residents to “show them something far more beautiful than the kind of division that they’re trying to stoke.”

Elliott Payne, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, also condemned the presence of ICE in Minneapolis during an interview from the scene.

“They’re an escalating factor, he said. “We need them out of our city.”

Homeland Security officials said the shooting happened during an immigration enforcement operation as agents were being confronted by protesters.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the woman who was shot had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” She added that the ICE agent had feared for his life and fired the shots defensively.

But Mr. Frey said he had viewed video footage of the shooting and he maintained that the version of events put out by DHS was incorrect.

Federal officials have defended the overall crackdown in Minneapolis as a necessary response to illegal immigration and widespread fraud in state social service systems.

Last year, the Trump administration launched several aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Democratic cities, where protesters have confronted agents that have sometimes led to violent clashes.

Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser under President Trump’s administration simply described the incident on social media as “domestic terrorism.”

The attorney general of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, said on social media that there were a lot of unknowns surrounding the shooting. But he said that President Trump’s decision to send armed ICE agents to the state is “spreading terror throughout our communities.”

Avelo Airlines is ending its deportation flights on Jan. 27 after months of harsh criticism and protests. The news comes after Delaware lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would strip state incentives from companies that support the massive nationwide immigration deportation efforts under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition has gathered at the Wilmington Airport since May to pressure the budget airline to drop the deportation flights. Activists in other states have also staged protests against the airline’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts across the country.

Avelo Communications Manager Courtney Goff said in a statement the company will end its participation in the nationwide Department of Homeland Security program and close its Arizona hub.

“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” she said.

Caritas Kerby, co-organizer of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition, said she believes the activism across the country led to Avelo’s decision to end its role in the controversial flights.

“I firmly believe that Avelo is folding due to the pressure campaigns all over the country,” she said. “It’s been months and months and months of hard work, late nights, meetings, coordination of a bunch of different organizations, and it’s feeling like a really big win.”

Goff denies that Avelo had a contract with the federal government to provide deportation flights, in spite of the company confirming to several media outlets in April that it agreed to provide ICE with flights to support “deportation efforts.”

“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Andrew Levy, Avelo Airlines founder and CEO, said in a statement published by Houston Public Media in April. “After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.”

Goff told WHYY News that Avelo was a subcontractor of CSI Aviation, which is currently the prime contractor for ICE deportation flights. According to the official tracker of federal government spending, CSI Aviation to date has been paid more than $560 million for ICE deportation flights.

Data from Human Rights First, a nonprofit group that tracks ICE flights, shows Avelo did fly deportation flights. The group’s report said the Trump administration conducted at least 11,192 ICE air charter flights from January through the end of November 2025, with Avelo serving about 17% of all November flights.

“We did do government flying, we are not disputing that,” Goff said in an emailed statement.

Proposed bills target Avelo Airlines’ economic incentives

A pair of Delaware lawmakers filed measures last month to address Avelo’s connection to ICE. The resolution and bill are sponsored by state Sen. Ray Seigfried, D-Talleyville, and Rep. Mara Gorman, D-Newark. Gorman said her constituents have been unhappy that Avelo has been profiting from these deportation flights. While Avelo did not run those flights out of Delaware, it did in other states, with a hub in Mesa, Arizona.

Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 would urge the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport, to prohibit agreements or incentives to businesses with ICE contracts that help deport individuals who have not been afforded sufficient due process protections.

Senate Bill 207 would remove a financial incentive for commercial airlines that operate ICE flights that include detainees who lack a valid judicial warrant or have not received required due process rights.

While the Senate bill’s language is broad, it would have potentially impacted Avelo’s jet fuel tax exemption and DRBA marketing incentives.

“We have every right to say how we’re going to provide financial incentives to an organization that’s violating a person’s due process,” Siegfried said.

In a statement, DRBA spokesperson James Salmon said that “while the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority.”

DRBA could make deal with second ICE contractor

The proposed legislation could prevent or eliminate incentives on a possible lease agreement between DRBA and Daedalus Aviation Group at the Wilmington Airport.

Last month, DHS paid Virginia-based Daedalus nearly $140 million to buy six Boeing 737s to use in deportation flights. Top company officials also head a separate company that has a nearly $1 billion contract to support “self deportations.” Daedalus did not respond to a request for comment.

Gorman said the bills are needed because Delawareans should know about companies operating inside the state that may be profiting off of the deportation of people without legal documentation who have been denied due process.

“[The resolution] asks DRBA to review the existing contracts, apply greater scrutiny to future agreements involving companies that conduct ICE deportation flights,” Gorman said. “And basically says that if public money is being used, the public deserves transparency and accountability about where those dollars are going.”

Members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition said they’re concerned the DRBA is trying to hide a possible deal with Daedalus Aviation because of its work helping ICE deport people who don’t have the proper documents to be in the country.

The DRBA is a bi-state government agency that owns and operates several transportation hubs across New Jersey and Delaware. It is run by a board of commissioners appointed by each state’s governor and is funded by tolls, user fees, ticket sales and retail transactions.

Rebekah Rodriguez, a member of the coalition, said she supports the lawmakers’ efforts.

“We think the legislation is important to increase transparency, to try to make sure that there’s no private profit off of the illegal deportations of our neighbors, and make sure that our institutions and representatives are being accountable,” she said.

DRBA pulls Daedalus agenda item after public scrutiny, revises agenda

The Delaware River and Bay Authority was expected to consider the Daedalus Aviation lease agreement at its Dec. 16 meeting.

Rodriguez said some activists showed up to the meeting to voice their concerns after seeing the lease agreement item on the agenda. She said the board quickly pulled it once the meeting started.

“Our community members showed up at that meeting and it was local clergy, parents and wage workers in our community,” she said. “When the DRBA saw us there, even though they are a public entity and they are answerable to the people of Delaware, they abruptly just took that resolution off and went into an executive session.”

WHYY News obtained the agenda that lists the lease agreement item from members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition. That agenda is no longer on the economic development agency’s website.

DRBA posted a revised agenda where the resolution number of the lease agreement now discusses employee retirement plans. Salmon did not respond to follow up questions from WHYY News.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/avelo_airlines_plane.png,N,,2026-01-07 21:57:14.402263

Democrats warn of an illegal act of war that could plunge Venezuela into chaos and set a dangerous precedent for unilateral presidential action.
Senator Chris Murphy was incredulous coming out of the confidential briefing, telling reporters the Trump administration is “going to take the oil by force, by force”.
We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.” Chris Stein contributed reporting","Top officials from the Trump administration arrived on Capitol Hill to defend one of the most audacious military operations in recent US history: the forcible capture of a sitting head of state from his own capital.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, attorney general Pam Bondi, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Gen Dan Caine, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, briefed all 100 US senators on Operation Absolute Resolve, the lightning raid that plucked the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from his Caracas residence and deposited him in a New York jail cell.

The session marks the first time the full Senate has heard details of the 3 January attack, which involved US special forces from Delta Force swooping into Venezuela before dawn to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.

Rubio told reporters that he described a threefold process to lawmakers on Venezuela that revolved around oil: first, stabilization of the country; next, finding access for companies to the Venezuelan market; and the final phase, “one of transition”.

“We are going to take between 30 and 50m barrels of oil,” Rubio said. “We’re going to sell it in the marketplace at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting.”

Oil aside, the operation has split Washington along predictable lines. Republicans have rallied behind Trump’s characterization of the raid as a straightforward law enforcement action to arrest an indicted drug trafficker. Democrats warn of an illegal act of war that could plunge Venezuela into chaos and set a dangerous precedent for unilateral presidential action.

“What we did is we took out an illegitimate president,” the Republican senator Markwayne Mullin said after the briefing. “He was never duly elected, so there can’t be regime change if he should have never been put in place to begin with.”

On early Saturday morning, special operations forces struck multiple targets across northern Venezuela, captured Maduro and Flores from their home, ferried them to the USS Iwo Jima, flew them to the Stewart air national guard base, then delivered them to New York. Days later, Maduro stood in federal court pleading not guilty to “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, cocaine importation and weapons charges stemming from a 2020 indictment.

Senator Chris Murphy was incredulous coming out of the confidential briefing, telling reporters the Trump administration is “going to take the oil by force, by force”.

“This is an insane plan,” Murphy said. “They are talking about stealing Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time, undefined as leverage to micromanage the country.” He added that he “heard no detailed plan” on Venezuela’s stability.

Across Capitol Hill after the follow-up briefing to the House, Democrats were similarly taken aback by the brazenness of the president’s campaign to cut out Venezuela’s dictatorship without consulting Congress. New York congressman Gregory Meeks said it was all the more reason to look at another war powers resolution.

“You better believe they would have a different position if this was Joe Biden,” Meeks said about the Republicans. “We’re being treated like the Duma in Russia, where Vladimir Putin does not have to consult the Duma. He just does whatever the heck he wants to do. And that’s what’s happening here to the American people.”

The push reflects broader public unease about the operation. More than six in 10 Americans believe it should have required congressional approval, according to a Washington Post poll released on Sunday. A separate Reuters/Ipsos survey found roughly three-quarters express concern the US will become too involved in Venezuela. Overall public opinion mirrors the partisan split on Capitol Hill, with the Reuters poll showing about one-third approving the operation, one-third disapproving and one-third unsure.

“Across America, people are just saying: what the hell is going on?” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said. “We need answers as to how long this is going to last. We need answers to how many troops, how much money, are there guardrails, things we don’t do, and a number of things that we had talked about were very troubling.”

But the question on what happens next in Venezuela is still unclear. Trump has said the US would “run” the country for an unspecified period and has allowed the country’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, a handpicked and supposed Maduro loyalist, to remain in a leadership role for now.

“The reality is the entire Maduro apparatus is still intact, and we know every other regime, if nothing else, it’s about self-preservation,” the Democratic senator from Vermont Peter Welch said. “So what you have here is a situation where everyone is in great admiration of the capacity of our military and how they did something that was extraordinarily dangerous and complicated, but there is no answer about what comes next.”

International condemnation has been swift. Brazil, Chile, China, France, Iran, Mexico, Russia and Spain have all denounced the operation. At the UN security council on Sunday, Russian and Chinese representatives demanded Maduro’s immediate release while the US defended the action as targeted law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers and US officials are also narrowing their sights toward Greenland, in the name of national security.

“The other thing I would point out, China and Russia are operating off the coast of Greenland,” the Republican senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri said. “Denmark is not capable of protecting Greenland, and so in my view, we have a very keen interest in Greenland.”

Trump has kept a naval fleet positioned off Venezuela’s coast, and this morning the US Coast Guard seized two Venezuela-linked oil tankers in separate operations, signaling the administration has no plans to ease pressure on the regime.

“Our military is prepared to continue this,” Hegseth told reporters. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He’s not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”

Congress is poised to further balloon opens in a new tab the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) already bloated budget, expanding ICE’s sprawling detention apparatus opens in a new tab at a time of record deaths opens in a new tab in detention. It would provide billions to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds DHS received last summer, including for private prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, we have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, leading to the detention of longtime residents, children, and even U.S. citizens. Passing this bill and giving DHS more money to detain our neighbors is dangerous and may lead to irreversible harm.

Congress reportedly is nearing an agreement to fund DHS for 44,500 immigration detention beds opens in a new tab, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to abduct and deport more people at any given day than ever before. This number is up from 41,500 beds appropriated for FY24 and would be layered on top of the beds ICE is already spending on with the unprecedented $45 billion that Congress allocated as part of the 2025 reconciliation bill. This is especially alarming given reports that ICE is planning to erect new warehouse gulags opens in a new tab for potentially over 80,000 people at a time. At Fort Bliss opens in a new tab, the nation’s largest detention site, we have already seen people exposed to brutal conditions, including sexual abuse, overcrowding, and inadequate food; we expect these warehouses to similarly be sites of humanitarian catastrophe and immense suffering.

ICE is currently detaining a record-breaking population of over 68,000 people opens in a new tab with deadly consequences—six people died in ICE custody in December 2025 alone, during the deadliest year opens in a new tab for people in detention in decades. Further, there is also nothing in this bill that prevents the administration from using this added funding to detain families, including young children, hundreds of whom have been detained for months in facilities without safe drinking water, medical care opens in a new tab, education, or access to lawyers. This is a system that needs oversight, not another windfall in funds. Passing this bill would signal Congress’ consent to this dangerous and exploding network of detention sites at the very moment that our communities need their representatives to hold ICE accountable.

This moment presents an opportunity for Congress to push back. Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Sen.

For working-class and poor people in developing countries, there are limited options to attaining legal status in the U.S.","For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Brady Brickner-Wood is filling in for Kyle Chayka.

Late last year, the White House’s social-media team lauded ICE’s torrential deportation efforts with a string of memes seemingly engineered to go viral. In one video posted to Instagram, the song “all-american bitch,” by Olivia Rodrigo, provides a soundtrack to a montage of deportees being forced onto buses and planes; in another, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Juno” plays as ICE agents accost people in the streets, the lyric “Have you ever tried this one?” repeating each time a new person is detained. Another video uses the satirical song “Big Boys,” from a “Saturday Night Live” skit featuring SZA, as agents handcuff people in parking lots. A line from the song—“It’s cuffing season”—flashes in all caps across the screen. Rodrigo, Carpenter, and SZA have denounced the videos as “hateful,” “evil,” and “peak dark,” respectively. (In response to Carpenter, the White House doctored a video promoting her own “S.N.L.” appearance to make it seem as if she said she would “arrest” the cast member Marcello Hernández for being “too illegal.”) Unlike other cases of Trump using musicians’ songs, against their will, at rallies or in campaign materials—Beyoncé, Adele, and Jack White, among them—these videos are not one-off inanities or easily ignorable promotional assets. Instead, they are part of a hundred-million-dollar “wartime recruitment” effort, according to an internal document obtained by the Washington Post, aimed at hiring thousands more deportation officers in the new year, a propaganda crusade intended to portray ICE as a team of Avengers valiantly defending American soil from a malevolent foreign terror. By splicing pop songs and familiar meme formats into cruel detainment footage, ICE strains to attract a younger demographic, hoping to convince people that the agency is a vibrant—and trollishly funny—organization engaged in the noble work of putting away bad guys. Oh, the pop stars got mad? Joke’s on them. Now even more people know ICE is hiring.

The Trump Administration has pledged to deport a million immigrants each year during the President’s second term—even, it appears, if the immigrants have not committed crimes or are lawfully residing in the U.S. This past summer, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress increased ICE’s budget to more than a hundred and seventy billion dollars across the next four years, netting out to an annual allocation that is more than the combined yearly budgets of all local and state law-enforcement agencies in the country. ICE has used some of this money to go on a hiring spree; the agency recently announced that it had signed up twelve thousand new officers and agents—a hundred-and-twenty-per-cent increase to its workforce.

Some of these new ICE agents may have been lured in by the ads running on national television, or by the promotional content appearing on social-media sites and streaming services. On platforms such as Hulu, HBO Max, Snapchat, Spotify, and YouTube, pre-roll and automated ads have begun popping up with alarming frequency. “Join the mission to protect America,” a narrator says, in one recent ad that appeared on Spotify. In another ad specifically targeting local law-enforcement officers in Chicago, an apocalyptic vision of America is reinforced: “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.” According to the internal document obtained by the Post, ICE hopes to target prospective hires through location-based marketing tactics like geofencing, a technology that allows the agency to send ads to the phones of people in specific locations, such as college campuses, gun and trade shows, military bases, and Nascar races. ICE has also allotted funds for right-wing influencers and streamers to promote hiring efforts, and flooded official Department of Homeland Security and ICE social-media feeds with memes. “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” one graphic posted to X and Instagram reads; another image shows a classic car parked on a beach with the header “America After 100 Million Deportations.”

The U.S. government has, of course, never been shy about its spending on defense advertising. In 2023, the Department of Defense’s total advertising budget was $1.1 billion, with the bulk of the funds being directed to military-recruitment efforts; in 2025, the Army’s advertising budget alone surpassed a billion dollars. Still, what makes the D.H.S.’s spending on ICE advertising so disorienting is not only how the agency is being branded as another branch of the military—a domestic war organization hellbent on eradicating a rival militant force—but how it has weaponized social media and digital culture against itself, a somewhat novel strategy for a governmental department. Traditional military calls to action, sometimes combined with white-supremacist tropes, are being deployed in the many memes and A.I.-generated images that the D.H.S. and the White House post daily to TikTok, X, and Instagram, such as Uncle Sam beckoning prospective recruits to save the country, or a nineteenth-century Manifest Destiny painting captioned with the slogan “A Heritage to Be Proud Of, a Homeland Worth Defending.” Anxieties about the border are hardly new, but they have been embellished to dangerous, deranged degrees during Trump’s second term. To declare war on immigrants, many of whom are fleeing persecution and violence fomented by past American interventionism, requires a powerful, blinding narrative strong enough to smokescreen the degradation and dehumanization at the core of the messaging. “The light will defeat the dark,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s White House deputy chief of staff, declared at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, in September. “We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil. They cannot imagine what they have awakened.” Protect the homeland. Remove the invaders. Destroy the aliens. The dog whistles have turned into fire alarms.

Trump’s time in office has obliterated the pretense that there’s any meaningful separation between the state and corporate interests. The decisions and forces that affect society, that dictate the livelihoods and well-being of its citizens, are at the mercy of the market, and the now frighteningly transparent ways that the market serves and benefits its dutiful governmental benefactors. Trump, conflating his politics with capitalist preponderance, has realized that to further his political and economic power, he must activate the state’s most powerful asset: the War Department. Threatening to occupy Greenland. Overthrowing the Venezuelan government and laying claim to its oil reserves. And, crucially, deploying the National Guard into U.S. cities, declaring a domestic war against a fabricated enemy: those who have altered the imagined portrait of the American pastoral.

When defenders of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies cite the possibility of legal immigration, they, too, are perpetuating the reality that market supremacy has usurped legislative processes. For working-class and poor people in developing countries, there are limited options to attaining legal status in the U.S. But if a person seeking status is already wealthy or attains corporate sponsorship, for instance, a viable pathway to citizenship opens up, even if only slightly. This prioritization of wealth is no better articulated than in the launch of Trump’s “gold card,” a literal card with Trump’s face on it that, for a million dollars, grants a foreign-born purchaser a visa and a fast track to citizenship. These are the people the Administration believes deserve entry into the country; most anyone else, apparently, is deemed an enemy of the state. ICE’s “wartime recruitment” ads also, paradoxically, prey on those who are struggling to find a way to survive within the bottlenecked economy, people for whom the stable annual salary provided by a job with ICE, and a fifty-thousand-dollar signing bonus, would surely improve their quality of life. The agency also promises a path toward meaning, a heroic call to “fulfill your mission.” The fantasy of fulfillment, the dream of belonging—something the so-called enemy is plenty familiar with. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695d8f8fe9d1cdb554fa06a4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NewYorker_ICEads_Final_animation_v2.png",N,,2026-01-07 16:58:45.311950

Persecution by guerrillas Venezuelans deported to Mexico are charting their next steps, but not having legal status there or documentation can make it difficult.
The Trump administration deported Edgar Sosa Rojas, 47, without his Venezuelan passport, his wife, Maria Stella Ferrer, told the Herald.","Amid the escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela that resulted in the capture of strongman Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has been sending Venezuelan immigrants to Mexico since at least December.

The Miami Herald has spoken with Venezuelans immigrants — including a single mother with two young children and a man who had fled government authorities in Venezuela and then a guerilla group in Colombia — and their families. They say they were held in detention centers in Texas before being handed over to Mexican authorities. The Mexican government later sent them by bus to the southern city of Villahermosa, where violence and organized crime has exploded in recent years, as well as the municipality of Palenque, in the state of Chiapas near the border with Guatemala.

“Once I entered immigration detention, I lost everything,” said Omar Vergara Flores, a 36-year-old man who had just purchased a home in Austin with his wife and was planning to acquire a construction franchise.

A shelter administrator in Villahermosa, the capital city of Tabasco, told the Herald his center has received several Venezuelan men, women, and children deported from the U.S. since Caracas announced on Dec. 12 that the United States had unilaterally suspended deportation flights to Venezuela.

U.S. deportations to Venezuela are heavily influenced by the political relations between the two countries. The last U.S. flight sending immigrants to Venezuela was on Dec. 10, according to Human Rights First, an organization that tracks and analyzes deportations, though the U.S. has not publicly announced their suspension. Caracas had previously stopped accepting flights in March 2025, after the Trump administration revoked Chevron’s license to pump petroleum in Venezuela, and again later in the year over U.S. military activity in the Caribbean.

The deportations of Venezuelan detainees to Mexico appear to be part of the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of deportations of immigrants to countries that are not their own, which the administration has negotiated with several countries. Deported and detained Venezuelans, as well as their family members, said immigration agents offered to send them to countries like Honduras, Colombia, Nicaragua and Ecuador, as well as Uganda, an East African nation with no shared language or cultural ties to Venezuela.

The Department of Homeland Security did not answer questions about how many Venezuelans it had sent to Mexico in 2025 or this year, nor under what agreements. Top Mexican immigration officials did not respond to Herald queries about how many Venezuelans U.S. authorities had sent south of the border, whether they would be able to go to the Mexican capital to access consular services, and why they were being transported to southern states with a strong presence of organized crime. The Human Rights Office within the Mexican immigration agency referred the Herald to its communications department.

In an email obtained by the Herald, an Immigration Customs and Enforcement officer told relatives of Vergara Flores that he had been sent to Mexico on Dec. 25 because “all flights to Venezuela are on hold until further notice.” The email’s timing coincided with the U.S. military ramp-up in the Caribbean that culminated in Maduro’s capture in Caracas on Saturday.

“The breaking point for us was when we requested bond [in immigration court] and it was denied, when accused rapists and murderers [in the criminal system] are granted bail,” Vergara Flores said, referring to his own case. His wife, Jennyfer Carrillo, added: “We mean nothing to them.”

Vulnerability in Mexico

July Rodriguez, who founded an organization supporting Venezuelan immigrants in Mexico, has documented at least two different waves of Venezuelans deported from the U.S. since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The first took place in March when Maduro temporarily blocked deportation flights and the Trump administration sent over 200 Venezuelans it accused of being gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador. In December, advocates witnessed another round of deportations to Mexico.

Mexican authorities have stopped sending deported immigrants to Tapachula, a southwestern city, “because organized crime brazenly took over the state of Chiapas, and many Mexicans have had to leave Chiapas, displaced to Guatemala,” Rodriguez told the Herald. But Villahermosa, the new destination, has experienced an explosion in violent crime in recent years.

Leaving Venezuelans in southern Mexico also makes it harder for them to obtain travel documents, since the country has only one Venezuelan consulate, located in Mexico City, a 12-hour bus ride away. There are also fewer legal resources to help deported migrants legalize their status compared to other parts of Mexico.

“The level of vulnerability Venezuelans face in Mexico is extremely serious,” Rodríguez said. “There is no clear policy that allows them to leave the country. Many choose to leave on foot or by bus through Guatemala. Others risk their lives trying to reach Mexico City, while some remain in Mexico with no support.”

‘A nightmare’

Vergara Flores was among those dropped off in the middle of the night in Villahermosa. He has a bachelor’s degree in architecture and another degree in informatics. He was building a stable life with his wife and had even purchased a home after entering the U.S. in 2022 through the Mexican border.

ICE detained him during a routine check-in appointment in June, after he had attended them without issues six other times. In detention, Vergara Flores lost weight and hair due to stress, lack of sunlight and unhealthy food, he said. Nearly seven months later, on Christmas day, he was among dozens deported to Mexico.

The couple’s new house is now on the market.

“He lived only one month in the house,” Carrillo said. “His detention shook our lives and turned it upside down. It was a nightmare that we never thought we would experience. We fought until the very end.”

Vergara Flores had been a beneficiary Temporary Protected Status until April, when the Trump administration began its efforts to strip the deportation protections of over 600,000 Venezuelans.

Carrillo realized her husband was slated for deportation when she could no longer find him in the system she used to send him money while in detention. Friends and relatives of other detainees started sharing on a WhatsApp group that their loved ones were being sent to Mexico.

Vergara Flores is currently waiting for his Venezuelan passport to arrive so he can leave Mexico. Without it, he would be forced to travel by foot or bus toward the Guatemalan border—a dangerous route where criminal groups target migrants.

“He was scared,” his wife said. “I’m still scared for him, but we are starting to see the light.”

Deportations on hold

On the U.S. side of the border, there are Venezuelan waiting for pending court hearings. But those who have already signed voluntary departure documents — often after prolonged detention that detainees, families, and advocates say has taken a toll on migrants’ physical and mental health — have no such option. Vergara Flores, desperate to get out of detention, agreed to depart voluntarily. But he believed he would be sent to Venezuela, not Mexico.

Freddy Villegas, a 31-year-old computer engineer, is among those detained who say the Trump administration offered a one-way ticket to a third country. He fled persecution from paramilitary groups in Caracas in 2021 and entered the United States later that year. He applied for asylum in August 2022, citing threats and fear of return to Venezuela. While his asylum case was still pending, he was granted TPS.

On July 1, ICE detained Villegas during a check-in appointment. He continues to fight for asylum and told the Herald that ICE officials told Venezuelans and Cubans at his detention center that it would be difficult to get their countries’ governments to take them back.

“They offered us the option to resettle in another country, such as Colombia or Mexico, but I refused,” Villegas said. He said he would rather remain in ICE custody, even though his health has suffered, than be sent to a third country or returned to Venezuela, where he fears persecution.

Villegas said he has lost 22 pounds during his detention and developed a vitiligo-like condition, which he attributes in part to prolonged confinement and limited access to sunlight. Some other Venezuelans, however, eventually became exhausted by their circumstances and agreed to be sent to Mexico.

Persecution by guerrillas

Venezuelans deported to Mexico are charting their next steps, but not having legal status there or documentation can make it difficult. The Trump administration deported Edgar Sosa Rojas, 47, without his Venezuelan passport, his wife, Maria Stella Ferrer, told the Herald. That has made leaving Mexico difficult.

Sosa Rojas first fled persecution in Venezuela in 2014, seeking refuge with his family in Colombia, where his wife was born. But safety there was short-lived. A guerrilla group kidnapped Sosa Rojas in December 2023 and later released him in Mexico, according to his wife and documents the Herald reviewed.

The Herald reviewed complaints filed with Colombian government agencies, as well as records from the Institute for Women in Migration, a Mexican organization that advocates for migrant women’s rights in Mexico and the United States.

He sought asylum in the U.S. in 2024, but authorities detained him in August and sent him to Mexico, where he was dropped off near the Guatemalan border.

He is now retracing the same dangerous route through Central America that once brought him to the United States, heading back toward the Colombia–Venezuela border, his wife said. Ferrer fears he could be kidnapped by cartels along the way, again.

“The United States was supposed to be the safest country,” his wife said. “But they deported him instead.”

The shooting occurred less than 24 hours after the Trump administration announced a large-scale immigration crackdown was underway in Minnesota.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents were met by ""rioters"" during a targeted operation. McLaughlin accused the victim of being ""one of these violent rioters"" who ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

The mayor called on ICE agents to leave the city, asserting that federal immigration authorities were ripping families apart and sowing chaos on Minneapolis streets.

At the same press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said local police arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound to the head. They performed life-saving measures at the scene, including CPR. The woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he added.

Preliminary information, according to O'Hara, indicates that the woman was in her vehicle and blocking the road on Portland Avenue between 33rd and 34th St.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,"" he said, adding that the car then crashed on the side of the roadway.

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents. He noted that the use of deadly force is justified at times, but that most law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are trained to minimize the risks and the need for deadly force.

""In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle of someone who's not armed,"" he said.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when a woman, 37, allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on DHS’s narrative in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,"" Frey said, referring to ICE. ""Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is b---s---.""

Video posted to social media shows several agents approaching a burgundy SUV in the middle of the street and ordering the driver to get out. When one agent grabs the driver’s side door handle, the car reverses and then drives forward.

An agent standing near the front of the vehicle appears to draw his firearm and fire three shots at it, the video shows. The vehicle then crashes into a parked car and hits a light pole.

Frey said after the shooting the first priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and the second was to get ICE off the scene because they were ""making a difficult situation more problematic.""

""What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,"" he said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Frey had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

""To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" the mayor said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents' vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman ""attacked them.""

""It was an act of domestic terrorism,"" she said.

The agent fired what McLaughlin said were ""defensive shots"" and killed the woman.

""He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said.

Frey said it did not appear from video of the incident that the vehicle was being weaponized against the agent.

""This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the mayor's news conference.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he witnessed the incident and it didn't look like the woman was trying to run over an agent.

""I heard that Noem is trying to say they were trying to run down an officer. There was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through,"" he told NBC News, adding that it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

Aidan’s wife Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood two and a half years and ""we love it.""

""We are really happy here. We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue,"" she said. ""There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards.""

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make a full recovery. She did not detail what type of injuries the agents sustained.

DHS increasing presence in Minneapolis

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The push has ramped up tensions with local officials in some cities and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts.

In September, in the Chicago area, an ICE agent fatally shot a man during a traffic stop. His family called for justice and local police said the FBI had been investigating the death.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there Wednesday.

DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday's shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.

Many Minnesota residents of Somali descent, including those who are American citizens, have been staying indoors or have reduced activity outside, fearful of being snagged in the stepped-up enforcement now in its second month.",https://ktvz.b-cdn.net/2025/08/Breaking-News-2.png,N,,2026-01-07 17:59:06.490653

""We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and make sure there is an investigation that is conducted in full,"" he said.

Frey blamed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for escalating the situation in the city.

""We dreaded this moment since the early stages of this ICE presence in Minneapolis,"" he said. ""Not only is this a concern we've had internally, but we've been talking about it.

DHS says driver was trying to ram agents

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that an ICE agent fatally shot a person in a vehicle, claiming that the person was trying to ram agents.

The agency's full statement can be read below:

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Videos circulating online show moments before and after the shooting

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot a driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out using an expletive. One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV. The driver appears to slowly back, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said at the Wednesday press conference that he had viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

""The narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative,"" Frey said. ""It is not true.""

City officials said there was no indication the woman who was shot was the target of any law enforcement activity.

Leaders, Minnesota residents respond to ICE shooting

At a separate press conference later Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said the state was prepared for protests he expects to take place in the coming days, and urged Minnesotans to ""not take the bait"" from the Trump administration to engage in violence.

""If you protest, and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully as you always do,"" Walz said. ""We can't give them what they want. The hearts and minds of the people in this state are on our side. To Americans, I ask you this: Please stand with Minneapolis. To Minnesotans, know that our administration is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.""

The governor, who announced a day earlier that he would not be seeking reelection, said he was afraid the federal government's actions would lead to escalation.

""We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety; that someone was going to get hurt,"" Walz said. ""Just yesterday, I said exactly that. What we're seeing is a consequence of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV. And today that recklessness caused someone their life.""

Reporters in the area saw more than 100 federal agents descend on the scene near 34th Street and Portland Avenue after the shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

According to KARE11 reporters at the scene, a crashed car at the intersection had a bullet hole in the front windshield on the driver's side. Two other cars have wreckage damage. Near the scene, protesters began chanting anti-ICE slogans.

A tense interaction nearby saw protesters throwing snowballs at federal officials. The immigration officials responded with pepper spray and paintballs, which are considered non-lethal crowd control devices.

The incident happened during what the Department of Homeland Security called its ""largest immigration operation ever."" An estimated six hundred agents and investigators are examining alleged fraud in the state.

State Senator Omar Fateh said in a social media post that he's received reports that a doctor at the scene was denied the ability to provide lifesaving CPR by federal law enforcement. In a press conference, Frey said he could not verify this witness account.

A witness showed KARE reporters what appeared to be video of responders attempting to resuscitate someone.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara previously said his department does not enforce immigration laws, according to KARE 11. On Tuesday, he said he appointed a designated supervisor and placed additional officers on standby around the clock due to concerns of potential unrest.

“Every day for the last several weeks has been a challenge,” O’Hara said, adding that his greatest concern is the potential for unrest or a tragedy in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. He asked protesters to remain peaceful and urged federal agents to conduct their work “professionally and lawfully.”

According to DHS, agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Minnesota, including 150 in Minneapolis on Monday.

In a statement on his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump said he had seen at least one of the videos showing the Minneapolis shooting.

""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" he wrote. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.""

The president said he blamed the incident, and others like it over the past several months, on left-leaning protesters interfering with ICE operations.

""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,"" Trump wrote. ""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""",https://media.khou.com/assets/CCT/images/ae8e45e7-b89f-4826-bc06-33590809ddf9/20260107T172437/ae8e45e7-b89f-4826-bc06-33590809ddf9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 16:58:56.227949

Congressional forecasters have lowered their projection of population growth over the next decade by 7 million people, in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown as well as falling birth rates.

The U.S. population is now projected to grow from 349 million this year to 357 million in 2035, according to a forecast released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.

That's slower growth than CBO was predicting a year ago. The biggest reason for the downshift is the administration's aggressive effort to cut down on illegal immigration. The U.S. also admitted fewer foreign students in 2025, although the number of authorized green card holders is expected to increase over the next decade.

In addition to slowing immigration, people in the U.S. are having fewer children, which is also putting the brakes on population growth. By 2030, the CBO estimates there will be fewer babies born in the U.S. each year than there are deaths. Absent immigration, the population would begin to shrink at that point.

Immigration also helps to boost birth rates, since foreign-born women have more children, on average, than women born in the U.S.

The demographic outlook helps to shape CBO's annual economic forecast, which will be released next month.

Analysts caution that the long-run forecasts of births, deaths and immigration are uncertain and small changes in any of those factors could significantly change the population over time.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3696x2079+0+193/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2Fbf%2F78c58a9841d882cfc881f35bf44f%2Fgettyimages-2249757777.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:57:44.762609

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it launched what it described as the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out by the agency — with 2,000 federal agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper sprayed.","Federal agents shot and killed a woman during a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Ilhan Omar, the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman, said the victim was “a legal observer” of action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which had sent a surge of agents into the city in recent days tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A witness to the incident, Emily Heller, told local media that the victim was shot in the face multiple times. Heller said she saw a car blocking traffic that appeared to be part of a protest against the ICE operation, and heard an agent telling the driver, a woman, to “get out of here”.

“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller told MPR News, a Minneapolis public radio station.

A video posted to social media and another video obtained by the Guardian appeared to capture the moment of the shooting as a dark red SUV drove away from agents moving toward it, although the front of the vehicle is obscured.

In a post to X, the homeland security department (DHS) insisted the person was a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.

The department claimed several ICE officers were hurt, but said that they were expected to make “full recoveries”.

“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” the DHS post said.

The videos mentioned above appear to contradict that statement, as it shows the SUV clearly backing up away from ICE officers as they approach. There is one ICE officer that can be seen partially in front of the car as the car moves forward and then away from the officers. That same ICE officer is seen firing his gun as the car appears to drive by him. Three gunshots can be heard ringing out.

There is no visible sign in the videos of ICE officers being injured. The agent who appeared to have fired the fatal shots is seen returning to a silver SUV that was driven away from the scene shortly after – through a red traffic light.

In a press conference, Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, emphasized that the priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and then to remove ICE from the scene because they were “making a difficult situation more problematic”.

He also noted that the video footage does not appear to show that a vehicle was being weaponized against the ICE officer.

Frey even issued an emphatic statement to ICE directly: “I do have a message for our community for our city and I do have a message for ICE. To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.

“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Longterm Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized and now, somebody is dead.

Contining to address ICE, Frey said: “That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury, is not done.”

The mayor also said the DHS was “trying to spin this as an action of self defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, told the press conference: “This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country.”

He said the victim was “a middle-aged white woman”, and that there was nothing to suggest she was the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity. Earlier, Frey said she was 37 years old.

The woman was no longer in the car when he arrived on the scene, O’Hara said, adding that “a spouse” had since arrived at the hospital. The police chief said the FBI would conduct a joint investigation with the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension.

Echoing Frey, Tim Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor, posted on X that he had “seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”

Omar also rejected claims made by DHS on X in a Wednesday afternoon post: “You’re lying. There was no attempt to run the officer over and no ICE agents appear to be hurt. Get out of our city.”

Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota’s Democratic lieutenant governor, issued a statement saying: “ICE has committed an unspeakable act of violence today.

“These masked agents are out of control and creating real chaos in our state. ICE must leave Minnesota immediately – before more people are hurt. In the face of their violence, let us remain peaceful, calm, and united. Minnesotans will not allow Trump and his thugs to turn our communities into war zones.”

Large numbers of protesters gathered close to the scene in the south of the city shortly after the shooting, with law enforcement officers firing chemical irritants in an attempt to disperse them.

In various video footage, bystanders can been seen and heard blowing whistles and taunting the federal agents, telling them to go home. A woman said she spoke to an eyewitness who told her the person shot was a woman who “took off” from federal agents.

“They shot her through the windshield. They shot her in the face,” the woman said.

Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper sprayed.

“ICE teargassed a lot of people as they drove down the alley. People were stuck in alley and hit hard. Some people are still getting medical treatment,” he wrote.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday it had launched an extraordinary immigration enforcement operation, with 2,000 agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis and St Paul area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9dc2e3567ce6166845974d69d43e6757e7e825/584_0_2916_2333/master/2916.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=153bbc629ee1befde1ffcc472a0c98d5",N,,2026-01-07 15:57:58.602676

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed the death on X and in a statement to Sahan Journal about 11:45 a.m.

Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference later in the day that the woman was 37, and noted that ICE had claimed self-defense in shooting her.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everyone directly. That is [expletive],” said Frey, who demanded that ICE leave Minnesota.

Witness Caitlin Callenson shared a video with Sahan Journal that appears to show federal agents walking up to the door of a maroon SUV stopped in the middle of the street. In the video, a federal officer pulls on the SUV’s door handle, and when the driver tries to pull away from the agents, a second federal officer fires shots into the vehicle. The vehicle moves forward briefly and crashes into a curb and another vehicle.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the news conference that the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the shooting.

The city of Minneapolis issued a statement at 10:26 a.m. Wednesday asking residents to stay away from the scene of the shooting at E. 34th Street and Portland Avenue in south Minneapolis. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino was present at the scene.

Gov. Tim Walz said on social media that his public safety team was “working to gather information on an ICE related shooting this morning” and asked the public to remain calm. Sen. Tina Smith said on social media that the shooting victim was a U.S. citizen. “ICE should leave now for everyone’s safety,” she wrote.

Eyewitness accounts

Tyrice Jones told Sahan Journal he heard gunshots followed by a crash outside his building at 34th street and Portland Avenue Wednesday morning.

Jones came outside and saw a woman in a maroon SUV bleeding from what he believed was a gunshot wound.

Tyrice Jones told Sahan Journal he heard gunshots followed by a crash outside his building at 34th street and Portland Avenue Wednesday morning.

Jones came outside and saw a woman in a maroon SUV bleeding from what he believed was a gunshot wound.

“They weren’t trying to do [expletive] for her. Nothing,” Jones said. “She was just there, lifeless.”

There were ICE agents around the car, Jones said, adding that a woman who appeared to know the victim was crying in front of an apartment building asking for a doctor.

Alex Weekes told Sahan Journal he woke up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard a car honking outside his house. Weekes looked out his window and saw a red SUV parked in the street blocking other vehicles from moving along the roadway. He said he saw federal agents step out of their vehicle and approach the SUV, and then heard gunshots.

“The [person] in the SUV tried driving away from them when they did that,” he said of the agents approaching the SUV. “There was one (federal agent) near the front corner of the car, and they shot [the driver] three times.

“I was just thinking, ‘Damn, did ICE just really shoot a [expletive] guy outside my house?’ I mean you never think that’s gonna happen literally across the street.

Trevor Heitkamp lives a block away from the from the scene and said he witnessed the shooting. He left his house for a cigarette shortly before 9:45 a.m., heard a commotion, walked down the street and started recording.

The woman appeared to be trying to turn her vehicle around, Heitkamp told Sahan Journal. He said she was going no more than 5 miles an hour and was receiving direction from multiple federal agents. Heitkamp heard several people shout, “No,” and then heard multiple gun shots.

The woman’s car rolled forward and crashed, and less than a minute later a passenger exited covered in blood, he said. The two people in the car appeared to be white women, he said.

A man who also witnessed the shooting shouted at ICE that he was a doctor and asked to perform first-aid, Heitkamp said.

“The ICE agents told him to back up and stay on the sidewalk,” Heitkamp said.

He heard ICE agents call out, “No pulse.” About two minutes later, EMS crews arrived, administered CPR and carried the victim to an ambulance.

“It didn’t need to happen,” Heitkamp said. “And I don’t think the government has the right to kill its citizens for inconveniencing them.”

Liliana Zaragoza, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota was in the area at the time of the incident and shared her account with Sahan Journal: First responders were seen performing CPR on a person on the sidewalk. The person was undressed, and had blood in their hair and face. Minneapolis police officials were present at the scene who told Zaragoza it was a “crime scene.”

“That person looked lifeless from the moment I saw them,” Zaragoza said.

Sahan photojournalist Aaron Nesheim was at the scene as events unfolded. He reported seeing a car that had crashed, with a lone woman in the driver’s seat. The airbag was deployed and covered in blood.

Twenty to 30 ICE agents were on the scene around 9:50 a.m., and a crowd had started to gather.

The woman was slumped over the airbag. Minneapolis firefighters pulled her out of the car and moved her down the street to 34th Street and Portland Avenue, where they began performing CPR, according to Nesheim.

The crowd continued to grow as the woman was taken to the hospital. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara arrived and briefly spoke to Bovino.

Minneapolis police eventually brought in an armed tactical vehicle, apparently to help with crowd control.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office posted on social media it was not involved in the shooting, but dispatched deputies to the scene to assist other law enforcement as needed.

More than 100 protesters had gathered on Portland Avenue and E. 33rd Street by 10:30 a.m., and about 40 unmarked SUVs, and Hennepin County Sheriff’s and Minneapolis Police vehicles were parked in a wide perimeter around the scene, blocking off the area with yellow tape.

Protesters shouted at officers, blew whistles and banged on drums throughout the morning and early afternoon.

Most ICE and Border Patrol agents left the scene at around 11 a.m. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) began collecting evidence from the victim’s Honda Pilot, which crashed into a lightpole and a parked car.

About 11 a.m., officers in camouflage sprayed a green gas on protesters, and began using pepper spray on the crowd.

Protesters remained at the scene as of 2 p.m. as officers took down yellow police tape and other barricades. A group of about 400 protesters began marching from the scene toward downtown Minneapolis shortly before 3 p.m.

Shooting comes on heels of increased enforcement

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarity issued a written statement saying her office has been in touch with the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, Walz and law enforcement leaders throughout the day, and is “pushing hard for a local investigation, which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”

Venus de Mars, a local musician who lives on the block, witnessed paramedics performing CPR on the shooting victim in a snowbank. De Mars said the victim appeared to be a white woman, who was removed from the scene in an ambulance.

“They didn’t rush her away, they didn’t have sirens or anything,” de Mars said. “I’m very worried that she didn’t make it.”

City Council Member Robin Wonsley, who represents a different area of south Minneapolis, posted on social media that she was on the scene with other council members.

“Residents witnessed federal agents shoot an observer. The resident was transported to a hospital,” she wrote. “I will keep you updated as information comes out.”

The shooting comes on the heels of a progressive escalation of federal action and staffing in Minnesota, and a visit Tuesday from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. An additional 2,000 ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents were reportedly deployed to Minnesota this week, according to CBS News. Sahan Journal has not been able to verify the number.

Increased immigration crackdowns will likely continue across the country, boosted by ICE’s increased budget and staffing. There are 12,000 new ICE agents in 2026, the agency announced Monday, more than doubling its personnel from the start of 2025.

More than 150 people in Minnesota were arrested by immigration agents Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a news release.

The deployment is swelling the ranks of ICE in Minnesota, which began an effort dubbed Operation Metro Surge in December. The most recent surge in agents is expected to last 30 days and include U.S. Border Patrol agents, CBS reported.

In a social media post earlier in the day, Frey said: “The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city. We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. The ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

“An ICE officer, fearing for ​his ‌life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and ‌the safety of ‌the public, ⁠fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin wrote in a post ‌on X.

Mayor Jacob Frey alleged the officer “recklessly” shot her, adding immigration agents are “causing chaos in our city”.

“They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets and in this case, quite literally killing people,” Frey said at a news conference.

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t,” the mayor said.

Dramatic escalation

A dark-coloured SUV with a bullet hole through its windshield and blood splattered ‌across the headrest was seen rammed into a pole on the snowy street where the shooting took place.

Venus de Mars, 65, a resident who lives near the site of the shooting, described seeing paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car. Shortly ‌after, they loaded her into an ambulance that drove away without its sirens on.

“There’s been lots of ICE activity, but nothing like this,” de Mars said. “I’m so angry. I’m so angry ‍, and I feel helpless.”

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major US cities under the Trump administration.

The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul have been on edge since DHS announced on Tuesday it launched the operation with 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The shooting drew protesters into the streets near the scene, some of whom were ⁠met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical munitions at the demonstrators.

A large throng of protesters gathered and vented their anger at the local and federal officers there. “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!”, they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and 1.6km (one mile) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Al Jazeera’s John Hendren reported Minnesota Public Radio quoted a witness saying, “ICE agents were telling the driver, a woman, to get out of here. She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of the car, and he pulled out a gun.”

The witness said “he [an agent] reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face, like three or four times”. The woman’s vehicle then accelerated and travelled about 30 metres (100 feet) before crashing into a utility pole.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle.

One officer tells the driver to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. The driver then slowly backs up and appears to be leaving, when another officer fires three shots. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.

The witness who took the video, Caitlin Callenson, said she was on a walk when she saw an ICE vehicle stuck in the snow. As more ICE vehicles arrived, bystanders blew whistles in protest, and the driver of the SUV tried to block the ICE vehicles.

Callenson said she did not see ICE agents attempting to detain anyone leading up to or after the shooting.

After the shots were fired, the driver was “then was completely slumped over in the vehicle,” said Emily Heller, another witness. Federal agents wouldn’t allow a man who said he is a physician to examine the driver, Heller said. Emergency medical technicians arrived 15 minutes later, she said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Secretary Dept. of Homeland Security, writing on X, gave a different version of what happened: “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Dozens of federal agents from ICE and the FBI, as well as Minneapolis police officers and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene

As some federal officers attempted to leave, protestors blocked their vehicle. The officers fired a noxious gas at close range, causing distress and vomiting for many demonstrators and journalists.

Protests are ongoing.

Protesters hurled insults at Minneapolis Police officers, who are not supposed to assist with immigration enforcement, but were on the scene Wednesday morning.

City Council members including Robin Wonsley and Jamal Osman addressed the crowd, saying the area was an active crime scene, and that MPD was present to investigate.

“We are trying to get MPD the f*ck out of here. That is the best way they can be helpful right now,” Wonsley told the demonstrators.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty issued a statement soon after the shooting saying she is “pushing hard for a local investigation which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”

U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a St. Paul Democrat, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who filmed herself observing ICE actions in Minneapolis on Tuesday, to immediately stop the ICE operation “to restore order and prevent further injuries.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Minnesota-ICE.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:58:48.725901

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city's mayor describged as ""reckless"" and unnecessary.

Watch a briefing by state and local authorities in the video player above.

The shooting happened in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, described the incident as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" carried out against ICE officers by a woman who ""attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.""

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization and the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers as part of the immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said, calling on the federal agents to leave the city. ""They're ripping families apart. They're sowing chaos on our streets and in this case quite literally killing people.""

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,"" the mayor said.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It's at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" and ""ICE out of Minnesota!"" they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

During her Texas visit, Noem confirmed that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made ""hundreds and hundreds"" of arrests.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noise-making devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

On Tuesday night, the Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session for about 100 people who were willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement operation.

EXCLUSIVE: Maryland’s top election officials are facing renewed scrutiny from Congressional Republicans after the state's administrator of elections declined to provide definitive answers concerning the state’s voter rolls after it was discovered an illegal immigrant serving as a superintendent of a massive school system in Iowa was allegedly fraudulently registered to vote in Maryland, Fox News Digital learned.

""Maryland's chief elections official failed to provide complete answers, leaving serious concerns unresolved — chiefly whether Ian Roberts ever received a live ballot and whether the State has implemented new protocols to verify citizenship after this bombshell report,"" Republican Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil exclusively told Fox News Digital Wednesday.

""This case underscores the urgent need for stronger citizenship verification requirements when registering to vote — which was reaffirmed by President Trump just yesterday in his meeting with House lawmakers,"" he continued. ""The Committee's investigation will continue.""

Steil is the chair of the House Committee on House Administration. He and Vice Chair Laurel Lee, R-Fla., sent a letter to Maryland State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis in December 2025, demanding answers regarding illegal immigrant Ian Andre Roberts' registration to vote in the state despite not holding U.S. citizenship. Roberts is originally from Guyana with ties to the U.S. going back to the 1990s.

TRUMP DOJ DEMANDS MINNESOTA VOTING RECORDS OVER SAME-DAY REGISTRATION 'VOUCHING' CONCERNS

The House Administration Committee oversees House operations and oversight and also is charged with considering proposals to amend federal election law.

The committee pressed for answers to questions such as: ""Is Roberts still a registered voter in Maryland?;"" ""Has Mr. Roberts ever voted in Maryland? If yes, what election(s) did he participate in?;"" ""Was Mr. Roberts ever mailed an absentee ballot? If yes, for which election(s)?"" and ""How does the State Board of Elections fulfill their obligations under 52 U.S.C. §20507 to conduct a general program to remove ineligible voters from the rolls?""

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained DeMarinis' response letter to the House Committee on House Administration, which defended the state’s voter registration system but stopped short of confirming whether Roberts, an illegal immigrant later arrested by ICE, was ever mailed an absentee ballot or remains registered to vote.

""While no voter should be on the Maryland voter rolls if they are not a citizen of the United States, being on the voter rolls does not equate to having voted in an election. This is an important distinction as we investigate potential illegalities and potential prosecution,"" DeMarinis wrote in the response letter dated Monday.

The Maryland State Administrator of Elections did acknowledge the House Administration Committee's questions specifically as they relate to Roberts but could not offer definitive information.

""Regarding the Committee’s questions concerning Ian Andre Roberts, SBE does not and cannot confirm that the identity of a voter matches that of another voter record in another state, based merely on the public facing information available,"" he wrote. ""Even in other states, as in Maryland, public information on those voter lookups is limited in order to protect personal identifying information (PII) from disclosure. Public voter lookup tools are not designed to perform voter list maintenance procedures. Therefore, SBE will not confirm whether the individual in question is or is not or was or was not a registered voter in Maryland.""

He added that public voting history in Maryland did not yield results that ""any individual with the name Ian Andre Roberts in Maryland"" had a voting history in the blue state.

Maryland Republican Delegate Matt Morgan, chairman of the Maryland Freedom Caucus, told Fox Digital Wednesday that, ""The Maryland State Board of Elections is dropping the ball.""

""By failing to comply with a basic data request, they are fueling suspicion,"" he said. ""Their primary job is to prove our elections are secure and restricted to citizens, yet they’ve chosen secrecy over transparency. If there's nothing to conceal, why withhold the data? It’s time for the SBE to stop dodging questions and start providing answers.""

Roberts' voter registration documents have faced intense scrutiny from conservatives, including when a Maryland county board of elections released redacted versions of the files in November that blacked out how Roberts answered the citizenship question.

DeMarinis said the redactions of ""the original production of the voter record was made with redactions applying to general requests for information under Maryland’s Public information Act, rather than requests specifically for a voter record.""

""Once realized, a corrected record was produced. The information redacted was redacted pursuant to State and federal laws that permit withholding of certain voter information. Federal law requires the redaction of source of voter registration,"" he said, referring to an updated release of the documents that showed Roberts reported he was a U.S. citizen on his voter application.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STRIKES DEAL WITH OHIO TO CLEAN UP STATE VOTER ROLLS USING FEDERAL DATABASE

Roberts served as superintendent of the Des Moines school district, the largest school district in Iowa, at the time of his arrest in October. The state revoked Roberts' education license following his arrest, and he is no longer serving as the district's top leader.

He initially attempted to flee law enforcement officers, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and was found to be in possession of $3,000 in cash, a Glock 9 mm pistol and a hunting knife at the time of his arrest.

The charges are his latest in a lengthy rap sheet that goes back to 1996, federal officials previously said.

""In the end, it is important to remember as our guiding principle that as the Maryland Declaration of Rights states, ‘the right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best security of liberty and the foundation of all free Government; . . . and every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage,’"" DeMarinis concluded his letter.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot the woman in her vehicle in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It's at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,"" Frey said on social media.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

“We’ve been trying to live life as fully as possible in light of the fear and anxiety that we feel,” said the Rev. Hierald Osorto, pastor at St. Paul’s-San Pablo Lutheran Church, which has a predominantly Latino congregation in the area.

The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.

“I feel like I'm an ordinary person, and I have the ability do something so I need to do it,” Mary Moran told KMSP-TV.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics.
McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make full recoveries.
Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.
The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when a woman, 37, allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city in a press conference held in the hours after the shooting.

“What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,"" he said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Frey added that there was little he could say to make the current situation better but he had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

""To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" the mayor said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents’ vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman ""attacked them.""

""It was an act of domestic terrorism,"" she said.

The agent fired what McLaughlin said were ""defensive shots"" and killed the woman.

""He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said.

Frey said it did not appear from video of the incident that the vehicle was being weaponized against the agent.

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The efforts have ramped up tensions with local officials and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts in some cities.

Video footage from NBC affiliate KARE 11 of Minneapolis showed a burgundy SUV with what appears to be a bullet hole in the windshield. The vehicle had crashed into a light pole. It’s not clear to whom the SUV belongs or from where the bullet was shot.

Brandon Hewitt, who is new to the neighborhood, said he was getting up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard three gunshots. He then looked outside and said he saw that a vehicle had crashed.

""I’m pretty right-leaning, but seeing this, this is not what you need to do,"" he told KARE. ""It’s not how to do it. It’s not how we’re supposed to do things around here in America.""

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make full recoveries. She did not detail what type of injuries the agents sustained.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there on Wednesday.

DHS, this week, sent hundreds of more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Minneapolis’ Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who has said his department does not enforce immigration laws, has expressed concern that the DHS immigration dragnet may lead to political unrest, KARE 11 reported.

Many Minnesota residents of Somali descent, including those who are American citizens, have been staying indoors or have reduced activity outside, fearful of being snagged in the stepped-up enforcement now in its second month.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/250107-ice-minnesota-vl-1150a-a7f6dc.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 13:59:10.290513

But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty.
People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby.
I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead.
People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.","As the Trump administration expands immigration police surges across the country, what has stood out has been the acts of resistance. Communities and organizations have put together rapid response hotlines, protested outside hotels sheltering federal agents, and carried whistles to warn their neighbors when immigration police are nearby. That resistance has kept me alive and has been so necessary.

But living in Little Village, a neighborhood in Chicago that was targeted by “Operation Midway Blitz” in the fall, I’ve also seen and experienced the psychological toll of these operations, both on the communities targeted and those of us organizing to defend them.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino’s surge of immigration police into Chicago has made national headlines for its cruelty and aggression. But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty. You never know when agents will show up or when they will decide to turn their presence into a public show of force. On some days, the neighborhood felt almost normal. On others, everything would shut down without warning.

First would come the whistles. People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby. Within minutes, streets that were usually crowded would empty. Sidewalks where street vendors normally worked would be completely bare. Businesses closed early. People disappeared indoors. I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead. I didn’t need to see it to wonder which one of my neighbors they had taken. My stomach still drops at the sound of any helicopter blades.

So, many people decided to stay home. Parents stopped going to work. Children missed school. Entire communities went missing. They survived by asking friends or neighbors to pick up medicine, buy groceries, or take children to school when they felt it was too risky to leave their homes. Organizations of all kinds have stepped up to deliver food and supplies directly to people’s homes. Individuals volunteered to give rides, buy groceries, collect donations, walk dogs.

During the recent immigration surge in New Orleans, I heard from friends who isolated themselves weeks before agents ever arrived. They had seen the violence in Chicago and began to take safety measures as soon as the news broke of “Operation Swamp Sweep,” the immigration police raid targeting Louisiana.

The Trump administration’s assault on us is not solely about increasing deportations. It is about manufacturing fear: the fear that keeps parents inside, students out of school, workers in panic, and entire neighborhoods from living with dignity. And make no mistake: this fear is intentional. It is meant to make us feel so unwanted that we make ourselves disappear.

These psychological operations are layered and intentional. Helicopters circle above Chicago as Border Patrol turns enforcement into spectacle. During these operations, teachers are abducted, children are tear-gassed, homes are invaded. People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol. All of this is reinforced by Department of Homeland Security ads on Univision and Telemundo, the largest Spanish-language broadcasters, threatening to “hunt” immigrants, urging undocumented people to self-deport, and spreading fear inside homes already targeted by Donald Trump’s policies.

As an organizer I cut my teeth doing civil disobedience and rapid response against deportations more than 20 years ago. I am not usually the first person to call for organizing mutual aid or mental health support. But what I’ve seen and experienced during these months of immigration surges has left me worried. Of course we have to organize and build rapid response networks, and make sure that people know to stay inside and not open the door. But we must also build the infrastructure that allows people to make those choices without losing access to food, income, care, or community.

I don’t know what the next phase of this administration will look like. I don’t know where the next surge will land, what new tactic will be tested, or whose neighborhood will be turned into the next spectacle of violence. What I do know is that this is not random, and that it will continue to happen. And because of that, the answer cannot be isolation. It has to be each other. We have to keep organizing, building networks that meet material needs and protect people’s dignity, creating systems of care that make survival possible even when staying home becomes the safest choice.

The damage being done to our communities is intentional, but so is our response. We will continue to organize because that is how we refuse to disappear.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2237593856-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:13:13.264617

""The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,"" the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents' vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: ""You will be held accountable for your crimes.""

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as ""a war that's being waged against Minnesota.""

""You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,"" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using ""questionable methods"" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was ""unlike any other day we've experienced.""

""It's incredibly distressing,"" Coleman said. ""What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.""

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

""We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,"" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for ""not meeting our standards and values"" when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.","The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Jan. 5 agreed to expedite an appeal of a court loss by U.S. business and research groups that are challenging President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, had argued that a speedy review was needed in order to preserve employers’ rights ahead of the once-annual H-1B visa lottery scheduled to begin in March. The Trump administration did not oppose the quicker timeline, and the court agreed to a plan that will allow oral arguments to proceed in February.

The Chamber of Commerce and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The annual process is the only opportunity for most U.S. employers that wish to hire skilled workers through the H-1B program to apply for the visas, according to the Chamber’s court filings.

“Those employers’ ability to participate in the H-1B program this year therefore hinges on the outcome of this appeal; without relief by March, it will be too late,” the Chamber said in court papers filed on Jan. 2.

The Chamber is appealing a Dec. 24 decision by a U.S. District Court judge, who concluded that the new fee fell within the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration.

Before Trump imposed the new $100,000 fee in September, H-1B visas had typically come with about $2,000 to $5,000 in fees depending on various factors.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with training in specialty fields. Technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H1-B visas. The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has separately issued a new regulation that replaces the random selection of the lottery with a new allotment system that prioritizes visas for higher-skilled and higher-paid foreign workers. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 27.

The Trump administration has said that the H1-B program has been abused by U.S. employers who seek to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.

“We have a government of the boss, by the boss, and for the boss, it’s all for him, and that hurts people, and it’s threatening to our democracy, threatening to the rule of law,” he added.

Conway used the fifth anniversary of the Capitol insurrection to launch a bid for Congress in New York. He’s running for the seat now held by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is retiring.

Human Rights Watch said it could not independently confirm that explanation.
Human Rights Watch urged the government to end arbitrary arrests, investigate allegations of abuse, disclose the whereabouts of missing detainees and allow independent monitors access to military barracks.
It also called on international partners to condition support for South Sudan’s security forces on respect for human rights.
“Instead of addressing crime, security forces have used this campaign to commit serious abuses against marginalized youth,” Pur said.","South Sudanese security forces have carried out sweeping arbitrary arrests of boys, young men and women in the capital, Juba, since late June 2025, subjecting detainees to torture, extortion and forced conscription, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Wednesday.

The rights group said the arrests were conducted under the pretext of a crackdown on criminal gangs following reports of rising youth violence in the city. In at least one raid, police officers beat and raped women in custody, the organization said.

“Security forces have arbitrarily detained, extorted and forcibly conscripted dozens of boys and young men, and raped young women,” said Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. She called on authorities to release those unlawfully detained and hold perpetrators accountable.

Human Rights Watch said it conducted remote interviews between Aug. 7 and Nov. 23 with 37 people, including victims and relatives, as well as civil society activists and United Nations child protection experts. Three of those interviewed were children.

The group said it wrote to police and military spokespersons on Dec. 10 seeking comment on its findings but received no response.

Youth violence and gang activity have increased in South Sudan over the past decade, fueled by poverty, unemployment, displacement and prolonged conflict. In mid-June 2025, a video circulated on social media showing the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl in Juba by alleged gang members, prompting public outrage.

Soon afterward, the National Police Service, the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces and the National Security Service launched joint operations across residential neighborhoods of the capital. While authorities initially described the campaign as a seven-day operation starting in early July, witnesses told Human Rights Watch that arrests continued through the end of 2025.

By early July, authorities said at least 600 suspected gang members had been arrested. In October, police announced the arrest of 32 alleged criminals and the seizure of weapons, saying criminal proceedings would follow. Human Rights Watch said it could not verify any prosecutions related to gang activity beyond the gang rape case, in which 13 suspects were arrested and seven charged.

According to the report, boys and young men were often targeted while walking or gathering in groups. Detainees described beatings in police stations and military facilities, overcrowded detention conditions, and a lack of food and water.

Several former detainees said they were released only after relatives paid money or provided goods to security personnel. Others said they were transferred to military camps in Upper Nile state, where fighting has intensified since early 2025. Human Rights Watch said some detainees were forced into combat roles, while others were compelled to perform labor for soldiers.

At least four families told the group that relatives detained by security forces remain missing, with authorities refusing to disclose their whereabouts.

Police authorities denied allegations of forced conscription in comments to local media in August, saying the operation targeted criminals and that some detainees were moved outside Juba due to overcrowding. Human Rights Watch said it could not independently confirm that explanation.

South Sudanese law and international treaties ratified by the country prohibit arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence and the recruitment of children by armed forces. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that detention of minors should be used only as a last resort.

Human Rights Watch urged the government to end arbitrary arrests, investigate allegations of abuse, disclose the whereabouts of missing detainees and allow independent monitors access to military barracks. It also called on international partners to condition support for South Sudan’s security forces on respect for human rights.

Mr. Rubio made his remarks in a briefing on Monday with lawmakers from the main armed services and foreign policy committees in both chambers of Congress. The same day, Mr. Trump told aides to deliver an updated plan.

The congressional briefing was focused on Venezuela, but lawmakers raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s intentions on Greenland given aggressive remarks this week by the American president and a top aide, Stephen Miller, two officials said.

Mr. Rubio did not go into detail on what he meant by buying Greenland. Mr. Trump spent decades in New York as a real estate developer, and one of his top diplomatic envoys, Steve Witkoff, comes from the same background. Mr. Trump has coveted Greenland since his first term.

Greenland is a sparsely populated, autonomous territory that falls under the sovereign boundaries of Denmark, a member of NATO. Denmark established colonial control over Greenland in the 18th century, and allowed it to become autonomous in the 20th century.

On Tuesday, leaders of six NATO nations joined with Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, to issue a remarkable joint statement pushing back against Mr. Trump’s assertions that the United States should take over Greenland. The nations that aligned with Denmark were Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland, all of which are close allies of the United States.

“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” they said. “These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”

“Greenland belongs to its people,” they added. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had not ruled out a U.S. invasion of Greenland.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” she said in a statement. “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief’s disposal.”

Some lawmakers voiced concern about Mr. Trump’s stated plans. On Tuesday evening, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, issued a joint statement saying the U.S. government must respect its allies.

“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” said the senators, who lead the Senate NATO Observer Group.

“Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our alliance exists to defend,” they added.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that “Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”

Those two nations are active powers in the Arctic Circle, but Greenland is not surrounded by their ships. In fact, it is the United States that has a military base in Greenland. Vice President JD Vance visited the base with his wife, Usha, last year.

Mr. Trump has also focused on Greenland because of its potential wealth of critical minerals.

The second Trump administration’s National Security Strategy says dominance of the Western Hemisphere is a top priority. That has been brought into sharp focus with Mr. Trump’s monthslong military pressure campaign against Venezuela and the seizure on Saturday by U.S. troops of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, during a deadly attack. And Mr. Trump said early last year that he planned to acquire Canada.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06dc-greenland-cvmf/06dc-greenland-cvmf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:29.565526

Last year, the Trump administration revoked Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans. DHS later clarified Noem's comments, saying in a statement to Action News that reads in part, ""Applicants are only eligible for refugee status prior to entering the country... Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love.""

For many, the backandforth has created more uncertainty. Speaking to Action News through an interpreter, Alex Moreno of Gente de Venezuela said his organization has been receiving more calls. ""All of us are hopeful that the Trump administration will provide more clarity and a path forward,"" he said.

Moreno added, ""We have obviously been very happy at the outcome of Maduro being forced out of power, but there is obviously a lot of um sadness too and uncertainty.""

Buitrago said the community is asking federal officials ""to provide a temporary path for Venezuelans to remain here until whatever is going to happen next is safe for them to return.""

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.","The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Jan. 5 agreed to expedite an appeal of a court loss by U.S. business and research groups that are challenging President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, had argued that a speedy review was needed in order to preserve employers’ rights ahead of the once-annual H-1B visa lottery scheduled to begin in March. The Trump administration did not oppose the quicker timeline, and the court agreed to a plan that will allow oral arguments to proceed in February.

The Chamber of Commerce and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The annual process is the only opportunity for most U.S. employers that wish to hire skilled workers through the H-1B program to apply for the visas, according to the Chamber’s court filings.

“Those employers’ ability to participate in the H-1B program this year therefore hinges on the outcome of this appeal; without relief by March, it will be too late,” the Chamber said in court papers filed on Jan. 2.

The Chamber is appealing a Dec. 24 decision by a U.S. District Court judge, who concluded that the new fee fell within the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration.

Before Trump imposed the new $100,000 fee in September, H-1B visas had typically come with about $2,000 to $5,000 in fees depending on various factors.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with training in specialty fields. Technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H1-B visas. The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has separately issued a new regulation that replaces the random selection of the lottery with a new allotment system that prioritizes visas for higher-skilled and higher-paid foreign workers. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 27.

The Trump administration has said that the H1-B program has been abused by U.S. employers who seek to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.

DHS claimed the cancellation was part of a “coordinated campaign” orchestrated by Hilton Hotels in Minneapolis to “undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.” On Tuesday, additional online posts confirmed the hotel’s refusal to house immigration agents, leading Hilton Hotels to cut ties with the hotel.

“[W]e are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems,” an X post from Hilton read. “Hilton is—and always has been—a welcoming place for all. We are also engaging with all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again.”

Private businesses generally have discretion to refuse service to individuals without justification. However, federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin. States can add to these protections. The Minnesota Human Rights Act additionally prohibits discrimination solely based on “creed… disability… marital status, sexual orientation, sex, or gender identity.” Neither federal nor state law expressly carve out protections based on federal employment status.

Human rights concerns

What they're saying:

Khanna posted photos of the exterior of the privately run detention facility east of Bakersfield on social media. He said his Tuesday visit was prompted by the detention of a constituent from Sunnyvale whom he said was beaten and was later deported.

He said he was escorted through the center, which he described as ""cold"" and ""stark,"" by six staff members, including the warden.

According to Khanna, several inmates told him they did not know why they were being held. He said he was most alarmed by what he described as an apparent lack of medical care at the facility.

""I am deeply shaken by my visit,"" Khanna said in videos on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, where he wrote a lengthy description of his visit.

He decribed meeting with 47 detainees, many of whom were in tears.

Some told him, ""We are human beings. We should not be treated like animals or murderers.""

Khanna said some reported that they had rocks in the food, they didn't get fruit for weeks, they couldn't see their family members face-to-face, but could only speak to them on phones behind glass.

He said the detainees came from Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Mexico, Nepal, Venezuela, and others. Most told Khanna they were never told why they were detained.

""I am sounding the alarm,"" Khanna said, adding that he wants Congressional oversight over ICE facilities.

No comment from ICE

The other side:

ICE did not immediately respond for comment.

Lawsuit filed

Big picture view:

In November, several ICE detainees, including Gomez Ruiz, sued ICE in US District Court in Northern California, alleging the California City center is polluted with sewage, provides inadequate medical care and is denying people access to food and lawyers.

The California City Immigration Processing Center is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield.

It used to operate as a state prison managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ICE contracted with the for-profit company CoreCivic to re-open the prison as an immigration detention center in 2025.

With 2,560 beds, the facility is the largest immigration detention center in California.

When the lawsuit was filed, more than 800 people were detained in the facility. On Khanna's visit this week, he said he was told that 1,428 detainees were there, including 215 women.

CoreCivic projects the center will reach full capacity by early 2026.

-General Ferdinand Foch

History is replete with times when an army in fighting retreat draws a line, digs in, and then counterattacks. The Russians in WW2 took world-historic losses, before turning the tide with a massive counteroffensive around Stalingrad. The French and British forces in the early days of WW1 were pushed back across the frontier. The Germans were within sight of Paris. But they became stretched out over the course of the advance. When a gap opened in their lines, the exhausted, demoralised allied troops had to rally, get into an entirely different mindset, and go on the attack.

Likewise with political debates, a side that has had the worst of it can decide to get off the defensive.

Across the world, free societies are under assault from a resurgent fascism. Across the world, fears about immigration have been one of the main—arguably the main—weapon used. And across the world, there has been a timidity on the part of progressives about countering these arguments. There is a pervasive pessimism that this is a debate we can win. That the public at large will ever side with a pro-immigration position.

To some degree this is understandable, but it is not wise. We have no choice but to fight—the closed-border, mass-deportation agenda of the modern right will destroy nations if we let it. And fascists will never stop capitalizing on nativist narratives as long as they are allowed to stand.

We are locked into a battle we did not seek and our timidity is keeping us on the defensive. It isn’t working. Our pessimism is self-fulfilling. In any contact sport, you get hurt more by flinching from the tackle than you do from committing to it. No one ever won a fist fight they were convinced they'd lose. In politics, it is not enough to contest conclusions and debate details. You must attack premises—trash and tarnish the foundations of your opponent's case. And you must put forward a positive, values-driven vision of your own.

The right has any number of advantages on immigration. And majority public opinion is often with them. But this is by no means inevitable. They are also overextended—committed to increasingly deranged visions, with the horrific consequences of their worldview more and more visible every day. It’s time to shake off our timidity, take a deep breath, and go on the offensive.

I have a hunch—no more, but no less—that most politically active progressives are ready for this. I think if a critical mass of us decided to take the fight to the enemy, many more would quickly join. And I think we would find the forces arrayed against us much weaker than we initially supposed.

After all, ‘turning points’ in war are as much psychological as they are strategic. A matter of changing the attitude and orientation of the army. First and foremost, we must understand what we are fighting for, and believe that victory is possible. Tactics will follow the will to fight, not the other way around.

Are you sure we have to fight?

That’s the question center-left parties have been asking. Their response has generally been to try and avoid talking about it. And, where that fails, to give ground, to try and find a compromise with the right, and show nativist voters that their “reasonable concerns” are being “taken seriously”. Nowhere has this worked. Barack Obama sought a deal with Republicans in which increased border security and immigration enforcement would be traded for reforms and protection for some of the existing undocumented population. He ramped up deportations to show he was serious about his side, but the deal never happened. And his preformative cruelty did nothing to arrest the radicalisation of the Republican base. Kamala Harris attempted to flank Donald Trump on the issue in 2024, arguing that Democrats had attempted to pass an aggressive bill on border security that Trump had tanked. This was a plausible enough read of the negotiations, but it didn’t matter. Voters concerned about the border went to the more viscerally xenophobic candidate by large margins.

The UK provides an even starker case. Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, the country has embarked on what can only be described as a program of national economic suicide to address the “legitimate concerns” of nativists. They are louder and angrier than ever. The current Labour government has pledged to reduce (legal) immigration, and numbers are in fact falling significantly. But, again, it doesn’t matter. Prime minister Keir Starmer has arguably gone further than any liberal leader in the world to appease the rising far right, and has been rewarded with historically low approval ratings. Even in Denmark, the poster child of centrist appeasers, their Social Democrats, after moving to the right on this issue, were mauled in local elections, losing Copenhagen for the first time in a century.

Progressive activists, and those of us in media and academia have done a little better. But only a little. The left will challenge anti-immigrant arguments as a ‘divide and rule’ tactic of capitalist elites. The billionaires, it is argued, keep us fighting a culture war so that we won’t fight a class war.

There are elements of truth here, but this assumes a rationality in the ruling class that just isn’t there. A world of closed borders does not benefit the billionaires. The Brexit project made virtually everyone in the UK worse off. Poor people are poorer, but businesses—small and large—have also felt the impact. Finally, in framing the debate as a distraction we risk implying that it’s not important. We keep trying to change the conversation back to topics we feel more secure on (economic inequality), rather than counterattacking directly.

Often progressives will call out the motivations of the nativist project: it is not, contra reactionary centrist pleading, drawing on legitimate concerns, but racism. Men like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are bigots and must be opposed on that basis.

This has the virtue of being obviously true. It’s also a somewhat effective political attack line. But the liberal response can’t only be this. Voters have been told, over and over, that immigration is a problem. That it depresses wages, increases crime, stretches social services. That the country is full (whatever that means). What appears to have happened is a significant (and election determinative) block of people have accepted that, yes, the far right are racist, but they’re the only ones taking ‘the problem’ seriously. I’ve heard many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, say that while they find Trump or Reform distasteful, they also think we need someone unpleasant since their country is being ‘taken advantage of’.

The wealth and health of nations

The reality is that, even if those proposing further anti-immigrant measures weren't racist at all (and to be clear, they absolutely are), their policies would still be disastrous. Even current immigration regimes are far too restrictive and are massively harming us. I think we can no longer be content to try and defend the status quo. We have to take new ground.

For some on the left, there is a fear that high levels of ‘unskilled’ migration will depress wages for lower income native workers. But this just isn’t what the data says. The past 30 years of empirical research have broadly shown virtually no effect across developed countries. ‘They took our jobs’ is a self-sustaining delusion that it’s embarrassing left leaders are still falling for. It’s even more galling when the charge is made by people who are actively and explicitly against raising wages for those at the bottom. When Biden ‘ran the economy hot’ during the covid recovery, this really did raise wages for the lowest income brackets. The response from the right was apoplectic rage. Centrists in the press screamed that this would be inflationary. When a ‘soft landing’ showed these fears to be incorrect, they resolved to deny the data and discredit the experiment such that it could never happen again.

I want a progressive movement that is aggressively pro raising wages at the bottom and aggressively pro immigration. These are completely coherent goals. They don’t always have the same supporters, but they have the same enemies. It’s time to take the fight to them.

To start with, we should firmly reject the framing that there is some ‘right’ level of immigration. “How many is too many?” is a favorite challenge of the nativists. It’s the wrong question. The measure of a country's success is if its citizens are happy, healthy, and prosperous, not if an arbitrary number of people cross a border.

In focusing so much on the former, we have abandoned the latter. Nativism across the world has made us more divided, poorer, and literally sicker. And that’s before we even get to its exploitation by fascists.

Look at the phone in your pocket—it's materials, parts, and assembly happened in at least a dozen countries. No individual nation can do all of that. Only a superpower like the United States could even attempt to internalize all those processes, and that would certainly be at an incredible cost. When politicians talk of ‘made in America’ they have steel beams, not cellphones, in mind.

Likewise, in a complex modern economy, it's madness to think one country could exactly meet its labour needs in all sectors. Especially when you consider that these are always changing. It takes 10-15 years to train a doctor, but a country with staffing shortages of medical professionals needs that problem addressed now, not a decade from now. American liberals often reference farm jobs that ‘Americans don’t want to do’ when arguing for immigration. And it’s certainly true that agriculture needs non-native labour, but so do many sectors, across the income spectrum. There’s a reason Elon Musk broke (fascist) character to advocate for H-1B visas—he knows that the tech sector is structurally dependent on them. He just imagines, with the usual nativist naivety, that sectors he isn’t familiar with will work it out if confined to American workers. They won’t. The idea of pure national self-sufficiency is a preposterous myth, long past its sell by date. We live in a deeply interconnected world, and this has been true for at least 150 years.

What has changed is that as developed countries have aged (and birth rates dropped) we've needed immigration from developing countries at higher levels. Naturally, despite these often being the people who literally care for our parents, we’ve made them providing this service as difficult & demeaning as possible.

The UK is a clear case study in how grotesquely self-destructive this tendency is. Our health and care sectors are in absolute crisis and that is impacting everything else, both consequence and cause of our national decline. A decade and a half of Tory austerity has left the National Health Service (NHS) underfunded as demand has continued to rise. Providing care for someone with advanced cancer or dementia is both expensive, and incredibly labour intensive—requiring both day to day supervision, and a system of specialised medical professionals. We hence need a wide variety of workers, not all of whom we’re capable of producing natively (32% of NHS doctors are foreign born). Immigration restrictions mean that these roles are simply not being filled.

Starmer has repeatedly claimed that the country is “addicted” to foreign labour. A bizarre framing that acknowledges our interdependence, but casts it as a problem rather than a solution. Our government insists we can fill these massive staffing shortages by training more native healthcare workers. We can’t. For one thing, we need more doctors, nurses, and care workers now, not ten years from now. For another, the universities that train said professionals are also in absolute crisis as a result of our anti-immigration politics: foreign students were a key source of income, but this is drying up in the face of hostile visa rules and crackdowns. Finally, the aforementioned project of national economic suicide means we cannot pay competitive rates—or anything close to it. Brits do not want to spend a decade qualifying to be a doctor for a starting salary of £32,000 ($40,000).

And this failure is cascading. Families with older relatives with complex care needs can no longer find the support they need. Increasingly, NHS hospital beds are being used for them as there is simply nowhere else to go. This sucks up already stretched resources and staff time, which in turn means worse services for everyone else—longer waits to see a specialist, or for operations. A younger person, perhaps a parent with young children, with a cancer diagnosis they might otherwise have survived, now does not.

You know the ""is anyone on the plane a doctor?"" trope? That's our national situation. And when the person who stands up isn't white British, we reply that we’d actually rather die.

This is no less absurd than the mainstream, bi-partisan view on immigration in most developed democracies right now. Most people don’t see it because they’re not thinking through the causal chain (from restrictions to staffing shortages to outcomes). Part of going on the offensive is getting them to. Part of shaking off our timidity is believing we can.

Persuasion

Shortages of carers for our elderly, or specialist medical staff, are a particularly extreme case. But more mundane ones exist in all parts of advanced economies. As markets change, and nations specialise in different things, the norm is that some sectors will find themselves needing more workers, while in others too many workers compete for too few jobs (and hence benefit from the workers who are willing to travel for opportunities being allowed to do so).

The US is larger and more prosperous, the EU has internal freedom of movement, but both are still harmed by overly restrictive systems. Both would benefit from, not exactly more migration, but from greater ease of it—from people who want to move easily being able to fill skill gaps where they arise. Yet liberal parties the world over are too scared to say this.

It’s not just a temperamental timidity. There seems to be a tacit acceptance that electorates are simply not persuadable. Even as anti-immigrant measures cause economic harm that weakens support for incumbent parties, there’s a feeling that people would not tolerate being told the truth.

And yet, for all that public opinion isn’t favourable, it’s also very changeable. In the US, Republican opinion generally follows fox news to an almost comedic degree. Support for mass deportations went from 32% of republicans in 2016 to 88% in 2024 as it became a mainstay of Trump’s rhetoric. There’s no reason to think that, if we offered a positive vision of our own, Democrats’ opinion wouldn’t coalesce around it in the same way. In the UK, support for ending all inward migration drops by 2/3rds (45% to 15%) if you tell people doing so would mean NHS shortages. Given that would absolutely be the consequence, can we not make that case?

We liberals can have such a lack of confidence in our ability to persuade. Especially on immigration. I often hear “I agree, but the public won’t go for that”. Or, we get scared of a retort in advance—“if we say X, they’ll just say Y”.

The nativists will “just say Y’? OK, well, is “Y” true? Does it make sense? Or is it, in fact, society-destroying garbage? It is? Then say that. If their arguments are trash, then trash them. To quote, of all people, Tony Blair (who, whatever else he did, won elections), “the starting point of any campaign is to destroy the basis of [your opponents’] case.” If you allow their premises to stand, people will accept their conclusions.

So why aren't we? I think progressive timidity on this topic, in part, reflects the insecurities of our leaders. Not liking immigrants, you see, is what the “real” people think—the working class, the rural, the less affluent, the manual labourer, the straight, the white, the masculine, the male-coded elements of our society. Being pro-immigration automatically makes you less “real”—elite, effete, multicultural, overly cosmopolitan, queer, overly educated, email job, professional, female-coded—dismissive of, and ‘out of touch’ with, the “real” people of the country.

Authenticity

I’ve noticed when I really slam anti-immigration arguments, the reflexive response of many is to call me a snob. I get ‘class promoted’, becoming a “private school kid” who doesn’t know what life is like for “real people” out in the “real country”.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m definitely not a private school kid. And I grew up, and have lived for long periods in, the exact sort of “red wall”, northern parts of the UK nativists equate with maximal authenticity. And it’s fine to say things like this, to let people know where you’re coming from. But we shouldn’t stop with such a defensive move, we need to go on the offense—challenging the assumptions behind the charge.

We should note, for a start, how selective this sensitivity is. Sneering at the working class is just fine if you’re cutting food stamps, or removing family benefits, or cutting social services. The right will quickly jump to deploying some very ugly class (and race) stereotypes when advocating these. The centrists' handwringing about listening to the ‘voice of the forgotten man' is dropped the instant we start advocating for material benefits. Again, consider the real fanaticism they found in the US when faced with a progressive, pro-worker economic recovery under Biden.

And talking about “real” Americans, or “real” Brits, is just—at very best—a stupid framing. I’m not a more authentic Brit (who has more authority to define our national identity) because I was born in Grimsby, or grew up in the North East, or because I’m white and male. I’m not less of one because I’m socially liberal, or because I have a graduate degree and dual nationality. The vast majority of us are somewhere between the ‘real citizen’ and ‘out of touch elite’ caricatures.

Nor is it even true that nativist sentiment is some intrinsically working class thing. Just as often, it’s a luxury belief of affluent pensioners who can vote their distaste for a muti-cultural society without having to worry about the economic harm that causes the rest of us.

The poorest Americans still marginally prefer Democrats. Both Trump’s strongest support and strongest opposition are cross-class coalitions. Likewise in the UK, how the bottom income bracket (under £20,000, or $26,000) voted in the last election is actually pretty close to the national average: Labour 33%, Lib Dem 11, Green 8, Reform 17, Tory 24, other 7. Reform is a couple of points higher, but so are the Greens. Also the combined left-wing vote share is larger than the right one, and more of the least affluent Brits voted Green or Lib Dem than did Reform. If you want to essentialise the forgotten, “left behind” workers of the country, the data supports a socially progressive caricature more than a socially conservative one.

Of course, there is no such stereotype that captures the experience of all ‘working people’. And the one that our politicians and press impose on us is, frankly, insulting. I resent the assumption that I must dislike foreigners because of where I was born. Or that my high school friends who didn’t go to university must be bigots because of that, or because they work trade jobs. They absolutely aren't! There are of course some working class people who are nativists. But there is also a long history of workers' movements taking socially progressive positions. And there is a strong culture of aggressive social liberalism among many of the least affluent workers for those with eyes to see it.

I think the reason the snobbery charge has been allowed to silence liberalism to the degree it has is because it exploits an insecurity. Not for most of us necessarily, but for our leaders. In the UK, our politicians (and press) are usually awkward, uncharismatic upper-middle-class sorts, who genuinely are a bit out of touch. They carry totems to try and affirm a connection to ordinary people. Starmer’s father was a toolmaker, did you know? Labour candidate Alan Strickland took it several generations further, boasting ""my grandfather was the son of a miner"" in a campaign video. These dullards are hence incredibly exploitable: They don’t have a good handle on what ""ordinary people” think, but do read a lot of upper-class (in many cases literally aristocratic, or part of the UK’s de facto aristocracy) conservative writers in our press who claim to speak for them.

In the US case, reactionary centrists in the press are usually from middle-class backgrounds, have a fancy education, and have spent most of their lives in big, blue coastal cities. I think they’re uncomfortable with how all these things have been feminised by conservatives. Ventriloquizing (what they imagine to be) the voice of the common man to attack (female and queer-coded) social liberalism, is a way for them to attempt to re-affirm their masculinity within the symbolically gendered framework the country's politics operates within. The result is highly privileged New York Times writers lecturing queer barristers and bartenders about what working people think.

I don’t know how to say this more basically, but this is all complete nonsense and we have to get over it. You can’t lead an army if your main preoccupation is if your enemy likes you. Liberalism can neither accept nor afford leaders with these psychological hangups.

I don’t know about you, but in a fight for our lives, I want leaders who instinctively hate those trying to kill us. Conversely, I think troops wanting a general who does not openly sympathise with the enemy's cause is a reasonable enough minimum standard. I also think that even the less craven of us are so used to a defeatist framing that we need reminding how pernicious a creed nativism is—and that there is nothing natural or inevitable about it.

Freedom of movement

I recently found myself in Barcelona for a few days—an amazing city I always instinctively vibe with. One thing I kept thinking was, when I was young, I could have lived and worked here for a year without restriction. Or Prague, or Berlin, or Lucca, or any European city. And now no one can. We tore all that up for no good reason.

In my early twenties I traveled so much, working as I went. Pre-Brexit, we had freedom of movement in the EU and I—owing to my dad being American—had a US passport. It really made me who I am now, and I think I’m such a better, more grounded person for having been able to.

It wasn’t all positive, I was reckless, I made mistakes. You know that trope Americans like to tell of some distant ancestor arriving in a strange land with just their clothes and a few dollars? I’ve literally done that a half dozen times in my life. And it didn’t always go smoothly! I remember sleeping on a hard wood floor, in a freezing Boston apartment—a run down maze of small rooms owned by an elderly crack addict who’d make them available to passers through, in exchange for us coughing up some dollars towards his habit every now and then.

I picked up what work I could, gravitating towards campaign work—knocking doors for a political candidate, or fundraising for a progressive cause. Those roles are always hiring. I saw so much of the world with them, and talked to thousands of people from all walks of life, often volunteering myself for the more exciting sounding assignments. Want to go work a ballot initiative camping in Maine? Sure. A road trip across upstate New York in mid winter? Sounds great. And in some of those organisations, I ended up taking on much more responsibility. In the chaos of the early Trump era, I found myself running big projects at a young age. Some of my more risky moves paid off magnificently. At one point, I left my job, ducked the last month's rent I owed, and got a one-way train ticket to start a relationship with a woman in another city I’d known less than a week. She’s now my wife.

And doesn’t all that speak to some fundamental human need just as much as the desire for comfort and familiarity does? I’m hardly the only person to throw myself at the world in this way. Go to any small town, in the US, UK, or EU, listen to young people there and you’ll hear talk of “getting out”. If that is what they want, they should be free to make a go of it. Free movement with other countries increases their choices in doing so. And for that matter, think of the affluent conservative retirees who vote for this anti-immigrant crap. What do they want to do with their time? Travel!

Sorry nativism, but contrary to your claim to being universal, there is a deep seated human need for experience and adventure that your unseasoned dork ideology just can’t satisfy. Of course if someone finds deep fulfillment in living where their ancestors lived they should be able to do that—that’s the point of freedom! But the insistence that everyone else do the same is, I think, fundamentally inhuman.

And that is the consequence of nativism. Anti-immigrant types never really seem to understand that these relationships are reciprocal. Americans often joke about moving to Europe if things get bad. Partisans of both sides seem to imagine there’s some ‘politically disaffected Yank’ visa route. Those who try run headlong into some of the most unpleasant, restrictive, and expensive bureaucratic processes ever devised. When the UK stopped EU citizens from being able to work here, we lost the right to work there. A particularly stupid example of this is older, Brexit voting Brits living abroad, who were shocked to find their own legal status in jeopardy. Leopards and faces, to use the vernacular.

Reframing the debate

The great advantage of going on the attack, in both war and politics, is to fight the battle on your terms, not your opponents. One of the reasons the immigration debate feels so unwinnable, why we’re perpetually on the backfoot, is we fight it within the nativists' framing devices. On their chosen ground, so to speak.

For example, immigration rules are usually conceptualised as being a relationship between a nation (to which we belong) and outsiders (who do not) seeking entry. I think they’re better thought of as a relationship between nations. There is, for instance, an understanding between the US and UK that if the former provides a passport to one of its residents, the latter will allow them entry for a period of 6 months, but not to work or stay beyond that (and similar the other way round). The relationship between France and Italy in contrast, is that citizens of either can live in the other indefinitely and work (more or less) without restriction.

The French and Italian relationship is a better one. Both with respect to human freedom, and the economic benefits to those who do not travel. The UK has catastrophically harmed itself by opting out of this open system. Recent estimates suggest Brexit has cost us 90 billion pounds in annual revenues (three times the size of the ‘budget black hole’ the government is trying to fill) and that the average Brit is £3,500 a year worse off (or 10% of the median income).

EU freedom of movement worked. It’s a wonderful thing for people across the continent. One of the great success stories of the modern age. Something to be built upon, not apologized for. And yet this is virtually nowhere said. Occasionally, it will be pointed out that Brexit was a mistake, but for abstract ‘economic’ reasons. Part of going on the offensive will be progressives the world over using the sad story to show why anti-immigrant policies specifically make life worse for everyone.

People will often say they don’t support open borders because the public won’t go for it. I dislike the phrasing because it reinforces the nativist model that immigration rules are about a nation to which we belong and aliens outside of that. I think freedom of movement provides a better model for the world we want.

Britain should obviously never have left the EU, but nor should this be the end of our ambitions. I can think of no good reason why we also shouldn’t have a freedom of movement deal with the United States. We have historic links, the same language, and deeply interconnected cultures. This would provide astounding economic opportunities for Brits willing to travel to access much higher wages in the states. And trust me when I say there’s a lot of Americans who hold a special affection for, and fascination with, the old country. Who would take a pay cut to work here for a few years if we removed our intentionally exclusionary and expensive visa process. And both sides would bring with them skills, experience, and different perspectives. Everyone would benefit, this isn’t a zero sum game.

Talking of the US, we should explore a North American freedom of movement deal. Say Canada, USA, Mexico. These countries are likewise deeply historically, culturally, and economically connected. Think of the hundreds of billions we’d save in border enforcement alone (and what socially productive purposes that money could be used for instead). The harms caused by this regime we could likewise simply do away with. Many Americans claim they have no problem with Mexican migrants, just those who came here illegally. Taking this at face value, we can elegantly solve that problem by making all movement legal. The tearing down of ugly and intrusive border fencing would become a glorious symbol of human freedom on the march.

Nor should we limit our ambitions to the global north. Let’s start where we have the greatest connection and work out, aiming to find partners who will make mutually beneficial deals with us. Britain has a historic connection to any number of amazing countries through the Commonwealth. What would freedom of movement with, say, India look like? That’s basically unthinkable now, due to pervasive racist fears of being ‘swamped’ by ‘hordes’ of non-white aliens. But the few who’ve looked into it think it could work for both countries. A saner society would at least consider it.

Attacking nativism

Anti-immigration politics’ claim to represent some natural human sentiment is a strange one, when you think about it. One we have been too timid in aggressively undermining.

People will always have communities which they feel they belong to, but nativism requires quite a lot more than that: It says that people are not only part of communities, but the boundaries of those communities, their composition and internal norms, can never change. And that people will react with hostility to any attempt to do so.

But these things change all the time. At the time of the French revolution only 11% of the population spoke French. The remainder speaking regional languages and dialects. The modern nation—as a culturally, linguistically, and ethically homogeneous group—is an invention, and a surprisingly modern one. One that had to be imposed, often from the top down, often in the face of real opposition from those whose regional (or other) identities were stronger. This is not to say that we should become anarchists, it’s the structure that we have, but it can exist in better and worse forms.

And if distrust of those different to you is simply how people invariably feel, it’s odd that this sentiment must be stoked by endless lies and propaganda. There’s actually something very artificial about the views electorates hold on immigration—they can only be sustained in a one-sided information vacuum. People’s fears aren’t inevitable, they’re what you get when they’re force-fed demininising propaganda by the right and liberals are silent.

Actually, when I talk to ordinary nativists, I invariably find they don’t feel the things it claims to represent—pride, cultural fit, a sense of belonging. Rather these are things they desperately want to feel, and have come to believe that excluding others will allow them to. “Everyone else has their own culture, why can’t we?” is a common lament. It’s particularly stupid in America which, for better or worse, is the undisputed cultural hegimon of the world.

Even in the UK it's, at best, pathetic and, at worst, ridiculously hypocritical. Britain genuinely does have cultural products worth celebrating and heritage worth preserving. But the minute that threatens nativist bigotry, they’ll turn on it. The right-wing press lobbied hard to get sports presenter (and former England captain, something of a national fixture) Garry Lineker fired because he called the government's immigration policy “cruel”. Doctor Who actor (what could be more British than The Doctor?) David Tennant likewise drew their ire for being vocally pro trans rights. The National Trust (which preserves many of our historic buildings) was faced with attacks and boycotts for discussing the British role in the slave trade in some of it’s exhibits. Even the Church of England—a core, traditional part of our culture for hundreds of years—is regularly assailed for affirming the traditional Christian teaching of kindness to refugees. These people don’t love their country and culture, they often hate it!

And we haven't even reached the most flagrant hypocrisy of nativism. It’s natural, they aver, to prefer one’s countrymen in the same way we have a special affection for our families. This latter part is true, and this really is a deep constant in human nature across cultures and time. Family takes different forms, and everyone is different, but for most people the bonds to our children, our parents and partners, and our best friends who are like family, are the most important part of our lives.

And nothing—really nothing—is more hostile to these bonds than immigration systems. After marrying in America, my father became ill. We made the difficult decision to move back to the UK to help my family. The response of the British state (which, we should remind ourselves, is in an existential crisis due to lack of carers) was to make this incredibly difficult, expensive, and uncertain. We have spent tens of thousands on fees, additional taxes, and moving around. We have had to worry, again and again, that we would fall afoul of ever changing rules. We have had to live separately for periods. And, if the nativists have their way, this would not have been possible at all. I would have had to choose between being with my wife, or supporting a dying parent. I once asked a Labour MP how inflicting such choices on people (which their making the family visa routes more restrictive would absolutely do) increased social cohesion, or benefited the country in any way at all. They had no answer.

And this is a fairly minor instance. Across the US, Trump deportations are tearing wives from husbands, parents from children. All cheered on by the party of ‘family values.’ In the UK, for a foreign spouse to have legal status you must meet a certain income threshold. Effectively removing the right to family life from the poorest half of the country. I was just able to avoid the above choice, many are not. If the Tory Lam/Philip plan were enacted, 4-7 million legal residents would be deported, leaving perhaps 10-15 million families devastated.

Ultimately, nativism is not some universal and inevitable feeling. It does not reflect some core human need. Travel does—throughout history people have moved away from bad situations, and towards the hope of better ones. We have sought out new experiences and adventure. Family does—most of us need others, we want to give and receive love. Nativism is a perversion directly hostile to both. Indeed, in our world today it is arguably the greatest threat to them. Its exploitation by fascists is the greatest threat to free societies and free political systems.

And the anti-immigrant forces, in our current moment, are over extended. Brits listened to anti-immigrant campaigners and destroyed their economy. Most Americans are, at very best, uneasy about masked men abducting people from the streets. The world over, we are seeing the results of this ideology and they’re appalling. Nativism has always been a form of social suicide, but it packaged itself as serious, necessery, and respectable. Now it’s increasingly, and increasingly obviously, unhinged. Public opinion is already starting to drift our way, and that's before people have heard a full-throated progressive case. If we hit back hard—and directly—I think we might find the enemy line much weaker than was imagined.

Looking forward

Immigration is a good thing. It makes us wealthier, healthier, and more free. It is best understood as mutually beneficial deals between states.

We should, as in the UKs case, re-enter such deals where we left them. We can reverse our national decline any time we choose. And then we should pursue other deals on top of that. I think that gets us away from the framing of ‘letting people in’—rather, countries come to an arrangement that allows greater freedom for both.

In the US case, I know proposing a North American free movement block sounds unbelievably radical now. But, in an age of increasingly ‘two teams’ politics, I wonder if that became our side's position the base would rally to it, in the same way the right’s has rallied to mass deportations. I also wonder—I don’t know, but I wonder—if the UK and US having, in different ways, really demonstrated the brutality and stupidity of nativism might have created an opening. If overflowing hospitals, or masked men on the streets, have been shocking enough that people are open to hearing an alternative who wouldn’t have been otherwise. Of course it would provoke real howls of outrage from reactionary centrists, but that dead-end worldview is what we have to move beyond.

It would also be coherent. What we are saying on immigration would match our values, match the positions we take on other issues. It could all fit within a coherent story of progress and pluralistic freedom. I’m not insensitive to the difficulties. The calculus for politicians is challenging. But that’s no excuse for the rest of us. Liberals shouldn’t tell liberals “that’ll never happen”. I don't know that this is a debate we can win, but I also don’t know that we can’t.

And just say we did—there’s no moral arc of the universe that bends towards greater freedom, but nor is there some natural nativism that rules it out. What if we won? What if 100 years from now the world was dominated by prosperous, egalitarian, liberal democracies, of different kinds, and with their own vibrant cultures, but joined together in an international order of large, overlapping free movement zones.

I think people in that world would look back at ours with disbelief, much like we look back at slavery and witch burnings. Developed countries using state violence to tear families apart on a massive scale, to place innocent people in inhuman conditions, all so the remaining population can live poorer and die younger, will appear to them—correctly—as a sort of moral madness. It will be almost unfathomable to them why the majority of people thought such a thing was justifiable, much less necessary. Our current politics will be intelligible only as a mass psychosis into which entire nations fell.

These future people will also finally be able to assess nativism for what it is. A disgusting morbidity. The claim that, for the nativist to be happy, the state must restrict the life choices of everyone else, will sound perverse and preposterous to them. One of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological desires one hands over with a shudder to specialists in personality disorders.

The barriers between us and that future are those of beliefs. Much of what is holding us back on the liberal side is fear, and various insecurities. The fear at least I can understand. But we have seen the results of surrendering the field to the nativists. Of only offering cautious rebuttals, without a values-driven vision of our own. Of implicitly conceding that this is just how “real” people feel. It hasn’t worked, and it’s time to try something different.

A much better world is possible. A more prosperous one in which states do not sabotage their own economies at the behest of bigots. Where people willing to travel for opportunity can do so, and benefit everyone in the process. Where an aging population does not mean those with terminal cancer, or in cognitive decline, must live out their final years in indignity, fear, or squalor. Where young people can seek experience and adventure, and older people can retire where they wish. Where we can find love, and form families, across borders without harassment. A world, in a word, that is free.

The surge dramatically expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota amid heightened political and community tensions. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons, during an interview with Newsmax, called the crackdown the agency’s “largest immigration operation ever.”

Neither Lyons nor Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said how many officers were involved.

A person briefed on the operation told The Associated Press the Department of Homeland Security plans to dispatch as many as 2,000 officers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied ICE officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Walz blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S.,. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Includes investigators focused on fraud

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops hotel that canceled reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

It is the largest such detention facility in California.

Since its opening early last year, the detention center — which is operated by the company CoreCivic via a contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — has become one of the most notorious facilities.

In November, detainees held in California City brought a class action lawsuit alleging, among other things, that the staff there “routinely engage in abusive behavior and unreasonable use of force.” It also alleges that people “are routinely subjected to solitary confinement for conduct that should not be punished at all.”

On Dec. 19, California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote a letter to the Trump Administration detailing “dangerous and inadequate living conditions” endured by detainees. If even half of what he says is true, it should be intolerable. We should have learned from the horrors of slavery and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II that treating humans in an inhumane way leaves an indelible stain on our history.

And, unless something is done quickly to address the situation, things in immigration detention are going to get worse.

Trump’s inhumane plan

Late last month, The Washington Post ran a story about a Trump Administration immigrant detention plan so cruel that it could have been ripped from the pages of the Marquis de Sade’s playbook for sadism. The plan is to dramatically expand the number of facilities in which immigrants can be warehoused by using actual warehouses to hold them.

The administration hopes to utilize these facilities to expedite the movement of individuals from the moment they are picked up by ICE agents to the moment they are deported.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons told The Post. The article also states that the goal of the administration is “to deport immigrants as efficiently as Amazon moves packages.”

“Like Prime, but with human beings,” Lyons said.

Human beings treated like packages?

We must say, “not in the United States.” It is time for Congress to hold hearings to shed light on the cruelty currently happening in these facilities and halt the administration’s warehouse plan.

As The Post notes, “Such structures are designed for storage and shipping, not human habitation ... (for) thousands of full-time residents.”

Lawless places

It is already clear that existing ICE detention facilities across the country are lawless places not fit for human habitation. The immigrants who are housed there are being subject to dreadful conditions of confinement.

Remember Alligator Alcatraz? PBS reminds us that “President Donald Trump toured (the Everglades Detention Facility) in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide.”

A few months after that well-publicized tour, Alligator Alcatraz has become a nightmare for people who are sent there. Amnesty International notes that they “are living in inhuman and unsanitary conditions ... (M)edical care is inconsistent, inadequate or denied all together.” Moreover, people held there are “always shackled when they were outside their cage.”

Meanwhile, the ICE facility at Fort Bliss, Texas — the largest such facility in the country — “is a massive tent camp … located in the middle of the desert on a military base.”

In December, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to ICE and to relevant Congressional Committees about Fort Bliss alleging that “detained immigrants are held for weeks at a time ... in cramped, squalid soft-sided tents with 72 people per unit, where toilets and showers flood eating areas with raw sewage.

“As immigrants detained at Ft. Bliss report, officers have beaten detainees and used threats of violence, criminal charges and imprisonment in attempts to coerce people held at Ft. Bliss to leave the United States and cross the border into Mexico.”

We can’t expect the courts to stop such treatment because prior judicial decisions suggest that detainees have less legal protection than prisoners. Because their detention is not regarded as punitive, it is not covered by the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

But as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held more than 20 years ago: “(A civil) detainee is entitled to ‘more considerate treatment’ than his criminally-detained counterparts.“ And, according to the court, a civil detainee should not be “confined in conditions identical to, similar to or more restrictive than those in which criminal counterparts are held.”

Today, I am not confident that today’s Supreme Court would apply such a principle to people in Trump’s immigration detention gulag. That is why it is up to the American people and Congress to reject what the administration is doing in California City, Alligator Alcatraz, Fort Bliss and other detention centers.

Humans, whatever their immigration status, should never be treated as “packages.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/9fke9k/picture313788624/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/6b4f79c6-d7a1-4803-a314-8979950cb8e0,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:33.355424

""The Trump administration has been saying for a year the conditions have changed for good in Venezuela,"" Sebastian said.
But the Trump administration has doubled down that Venezuelans in the country with temporary status must leave.
She added that every individual under TPS ""has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward.""","The last few days have been full of emotions for Sebastian, a 28-year-old Venezuelan architect who lives in Miami.

Sebastian, who asked to be identified by his first name because of his ongoing immigration case, says he was happy to learn U.S. forces had captured President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela in the early hours of Jan. 3.

""I felt a relief, because I thought that there'd be a radical change in the country,"" he told NPR. ""Maybe things were going to be different.""

But in a press conference later that day, President Trump said his administration had a conversation with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's deputy and vice president. Trump said his administration was working with her toward U.S. plans to run the country.

That announcement left Sebastian disappointed. He said he feels the danger is still as present in Venezuela.

But the Trump administration says it is safe for Venezuelans to go back to their country, especially those who were in the U.S. with temporary protected status, or TPS. The administration ended the program for more than 600,000 Venezuelans last year, saying then that conditions in the country had improved.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told Fox News on Sunday, ""the great news for those who are here from Venezuela on temporary protected status is that now they can go home with hope for their country — a country that they love — that there is going to be peace, prosperity and stability.""

But Sebastian, who came to the U.S. in 2023 and had TPS, said that does not make sense.

""The Trump administration has been saying for a year the conditions have changed for good in Venezuela,"" Sebastian said. ""But I would ask, if the U.S. has to extract a man who took over the government, how am I supposed to believe that the situation in Venezuela is good? It's contradictory, I see the opposite — the situation is worse.""

The Department of State has advised U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela ""due to severe risks to Americans, including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.""

On Monday, at least 14 journalists — most from international news organizations — were detained in Venezuela, according to Venezuela's National Union of Press Workers. There are also reports that armed groups are already working to suppress any support for Maduro's ouster.

Luis Falcón said going back to Venezuela under these conditions can put those returning at extreme risk. He came to the U.S. in 2017 after fleeing persecution.

He used to work for the Presidential Honor Guard, the security detail assigned to presidents and their family members. But after retiring in 2009, he started to join protests against the Maduro government. Authorities threatened him with jail time for betraying the country, and he decided to leave Venezuela.

""I'm grateful for the big step taken in Venezuela,"" Falcón said. ""But this is the beginning of the end. There's still a long road ahead for Venezuela to become a country of liberties, opportunities and justice for those Venezuelans who have been part of the opposition.""

He said returning now is impossible.

""Putting a foot back in Venezuela means I will be taken to jail, tortured, and potentially killed,"" Falcón said.

He says TPS should be restored for Venezuelans until there's a transition of government there. But the Trump administration has doubled down that Venezuelans in the country with temporary status must leave.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that ""Venezuela today is more free than it was yesterday."" She added that every individual under TPS ""has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward.""

However, immigration attorneys said that's misleading.

""Saying that someone can apply for refugee status within the U.S. — the generous interpretation is that she misspoke,"" said Lily Axelrod, an immigration lawyer based in Memphis, Tenn. ""The less generous interpretation is that she doesn't know what she's talking about or is lying.""

To apply for refugee status, she says, an immigrant must be outside the U.S. Axelrod said Venezuelans in the U.S. could still apply for asylum, although that could be a challenge, especially after the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions in November.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+142/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9a%2F19%2F70374f9d4974a2a7f4dcefb6101f%2F260105-nyre-josealvaradojr-30.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 08:57:33.590085

The challenge to Trump’s tariffs has been one of the most closely watched cases on the court’s docket amid the broader impact on the global economy.

In a social media post on Friday, Trump said such a ruling would be a “terrible blow” to the US.

“Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE,” Trump said in another post on Monday.

However, data on this is mixed. The US gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, marking the biggest increase in two years. Meanwhile, US job growth has slowed, with sectors heavily exposed to tariffs seeing little to no job growth.

“Jobs in sectors with higher import exposure grew more slowly than jobs in sectors with lower import exposure, suggesting tariffs may have weighed on employment,” Johannes Matschke, senior economist for the Kansas City branch of the Federal Reserve, said in an analysis in December.

Legal arguments

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in February 2025 on goods imported from individual countries to address, what he called, a national emergency related to US trade deficits.

Arguments challenging the legality of the decision began in November. At the time, the court’s liberal and some conservative justices had doubts about the legality of using the 1977 act.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed during his first term, was among those sceptical.

“Congress, as a practical matter, can’t get this power back once it’s handed it over to the president,” Gorsuch said at the time.

Chief Justice John Roberts told Solicitor General D John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the administration, that imposing tariffs and taxes “has always been the core power of Congress”.

The act grants broad executive authority to wield economic power in the case of a national emergency.

The matter reached the Supreme Court after the lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, finding that the use of the law exceeded the administration’s authority.

Among the courts that ruled against the White House was the Court of International Trade. In May, the New York court said that Congress, and not the executive branch, has “exclusive authority to regulate commerce”. This decision was upheld in a Washington, DC, appeals court in August.

Legal experts believe it is likely that the high court will uphold lower court decisions.

“My sense is that, given the different justices’ concerns, the Supreme Court will decide that IEEPA does not provide the ability for the Trump administration to adopt the tariffs,” Greg Shaffer, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera.

If the Trump administration were to lose the case, the US would need to refund some of the tariffs.

“It [ruling against the administration] would mean that those who paid tariffs that were imposed illegally would have to be reimbursed. I would think that that would be the outcome,” Shaffer added.

In September, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the US would “have to give a refund on about half the tariffs”.
