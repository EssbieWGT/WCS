Where the Board of Immigration Appeals denied a petitioner’s third motion to reopen, that decision should be upheld because the petitioner’s new arguments regarding notice are entirely without merit.

“An immigration judge (IJ) issued a removal order for Miriam Patricia Vargas-Rodriguez in 2009. In 2024, Vargas-Rodriguez filed her third motion to reopen. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied the motion. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY Vargas-Rodriguez’s petition for review.

“Vargas-Rodriguez’s third motion to reopen raises an open question for this court. This court has not yet ruled in a published decision on whether a petitioner may file multiple motions to reopen based on a lack of notice. … Our sibling circuits differ on this issue.

“But we have no need to answer this question in the present case. Even if Vargas-Rodriguez is correct that she is permitted to file multiple motions to reopen based on a lack of notice, any error by the BIA in failing to consider those arguments here would be harmless because her new arguments regarding notice are entirely without merit.”

""Clearly, participation in ICE's Task Force Model could offer substantial financial benefits to Dallas,"" Johnson said in the memo.
Johnson is requesting briefings during the meeting from both ICE representatives and the Dallas police chief regarding the rejected $25 million offer and the 287(g) program.
What is the 287(g) program?
The city of Keller also participates in the 287(g) program through its jail.","Dallas Mayor Eric L. Johnson is calling for a public review of Police Chief Daniel Comeaux's decision to reject a $25 million federal offer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, urging a joint committee meeting to determine whether the city should reconsider joining the 287(g) immigration enforcement program.

Mayor seeks committee briefing

The Republican mayor's request follows Comeaux's disclosure to the Community Police Oversight Board that he personally declined ICE's $25 million offer, citing concerns about bringing unwanted attention to Dallas.

The 287(g) program allows local law enforcement agencies to perform certain immigration duties under federal authority. Recent changes in Texas law now require county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the program's models.

Johnson says the decision should be made transparently, with public input and a thorough analysis of both financial implications and public safety impact.

Memo outlines mayor's request

In a memorandum sent Friday to city committee chairs - Cara Mendelsohn (Public Safety) and Maxie Johnson (Government Efficiency) - Mayor Johnson asked for a joint meeting to be convened as soon as possible.

""Clearly, participation in ICE's Task Force Model could offer substantial financial benefits to Dallas,"" Johnson said in the memo. ""These funds could be used to hire additional officers without impacting the city's budget. Declining ICE's offer may mean forfeiting significant financial resources.""

Johnson is requesting briefings during the meeting from both ICE representatives and the Dallas police chief regarding the rejected $25 million offer and the 287(g) program. He is urging the committees to evaluate the potential financial efficiencies and public safety benefits of participating in ICE's Task Force Model.

He also said public input should be considered in the decision-making process, followed by a thoroughly vetted recommendation from the committees to be presented to the full City Council for potential further action.

Comeaux explains his decision

Comeaux disclosed the rejection of the $25 million federal offer during a recent Community Police Oversight Board meeting.

During the meeting, he clarified that social media posts suggesting Dallas police were helping ICE were inaccurate. Officers were assisting U.S. Marshals, Comeaux said.

He emphasized that the department has had ""very little interaction with ICE.""

""We were contacted by the federal government, I think it was last week or within the last two weeks, and we were offered $25 million to be appointed 287(g),"" Comeaux said. ""We said absolutely no, not no. That was me who said that, turned it down.

""There's nothing happening in Dallas, but every time we do something like this, we're bringing more attention to Dallas. We don't need that attention. We don't want to deal with that smoke.""

What is the 287(g) program?

Since 1996, state and local law enforcement agencies have been able to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties through a voluntary program known as 287(g).

The program includes three models that departments can participate in:

Serving administrative warrants in jails

Executing civil immigration warrants on behalf of the federal government

Conducting limited immigration enforcement activities

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature passed a law requiring all county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the 287(g) models.

North Texas participation details

In February, CBS News Texas asked sheriff's departments in North Texas' four largest counties how they were assisting the Trump administration with immigration enforcement. Dallas, Tarrant, Collin, and Denton counties reported checking the immigration status of any inmates processed through their jails.

The Collin County Sheriff's Office also said it assists federal authorities in apprehending undocumented immigrants when requested.

The city of Keller also participates in the 287(g) program through its jail.

Johnson outlines potential benefits

As of July, more than 100 Texas agencies were participating in the program. Under Senate Bill 8, ""nearly all Texas counties - including Dallas County - are now required to participate,"" Johnson said.

He said ICE now offers full reimbursement for trained officers' salaries, benefits, and overtime.

Potential benefits, Johnson said, include funding additional officers with no budget impact, helping remove violent repeat offenders from the streets, and acting as a ""force multiplier"" for law enforcement.

""Together, we can continue to make our city government more efficient and responsible, and make Dallas safer, stronger, and more vibrant,"" Johnson said.

Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.
During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.
The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.
Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.","Maria worked cleaning schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries.

In August, it all ended.

When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.

“I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it’s happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump’s erratic trade policies.

Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money. But they also bring the technical skills and entrepreneurial energy that have helped make the United States the world’s economic superpower.

Trump is attacking immigration at both ends of spectrum, deporting low-wage laborers and discouraging skilled foreigners from bringing their talents to the United States.

And he is targeting an influx of foreign workers that eased labor shortages and upward pressure on wages and prices at a time when most economists thought that taming inflation would require sky-high interest rates and a recession — a fate the United States escaped in 2023 and 2024.

“Immigrants are good for the economy,” said Lee Branstetter, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. “Because we had a lot of immigration over the past five years, an inflationary surge was not as bad as many people expected.”

More workers filling more jobs and spending more money has also helped drive economic growth and create still-more job openings. Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.

In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth “could be near zero or negative in the next few years.’’

Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The September jobs report has been delayed by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump’s immigration and trade policies, downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024.

‘We need these people’

Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin.

“That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’

Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.”

Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’

The ICE crackdown

Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an “invasion” at America’s southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.

And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals.

Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have.

The incident enraged the South Koreans and ran counter to Trump’s push to lure foreign manufacturers to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn’t get visas promptly and risked getting detained.

Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields

America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters.

But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum.

“You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’

Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born Medicaid recipients could head to the fields to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’

The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket.

“The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’

“You’re not welcome here”

Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.

“Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’

Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000.

“A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,” Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. “It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’

Some are already packing up.

In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa’s poor, said Trump’s signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders.

The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said.

U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 forbidding the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard, ruling there was “no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Since then, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stay Perry’s order blocking the National Guard’s deployment, with a three-judge panel writing in an opinion published Thursday that “political opposition is not rebellion.”

But the administration is continuing its insistence that Chicago-area protests against Trump’s immigration enforcement actions are far more violent than the accounts Perry relied upon in issuing her two-week temporary restraining order. The order is set to expire on Thursday, Oct. 23, though Perry has scheduled a hearing the day before on a possible extension.

Sauer wrote that continued delays in deploying guardsmen to protect federal immigration agents and property from “rioters” puts agents’ lives at risk. He cited incidents of slashed tires on vehicles belonging to Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and alleged protesters have aimed fireworks at agents “and have thrown bottles, rocks, and tear gas at them.”

The filing accused Perry of having “disregarded outright the evidence of violence proffered by federal officials” and “instead accepting the implausibly rosy assessment of state and local officials,” which he called “indefensible.”

Perry was appointed to the bench last year after former President Joe Biden’s previous attempt to appoint her U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois was blocked in the Senate by now-Vice President J.D. Vance.

The judge last week said the DOJ’s arguments — particularly its characterization of the protests she noted had never exceeded 200 people outside the ICE facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview — seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.” She also gave credence to allegations that agents were often the aggressors in clashes with protesters and predicted that deploying the National Guard “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

But on Friday, Sauer shot back that the judge’s ruling was part of “a disturbing and recurring pattern” that follows similar cases in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon.

In his telling, protestors in those Democratic strongholds put immigration agents at risk and obstructed their work while local law enforcement offered only “tepid support,” prompting the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard for the protection of agents and federal property.

They erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they police.

What we need is smart law enforcement, secure borders, a modernized asylum system, a clear and fair path to legalization and a relentless focus on dismantling the cartels.","When it comes to fixing our immigration system, Democrats and Republicans in Congress both need to admit where they have been wrong. This includes acknowledging that for decades, both parties ignored the main problem: the cartels that have made billions of dollars smuggling people, drugs and weapons into the United States.

Democrats must concede that Donald Trump was right about the importance of securing the border. He was right about the need to create a joint task force — involving multiple government departments, agencies and military branches — to fight the cartels. And he was right about the need to deport violent criminals who are in this country illegally.

But Republicans have to realize that the Trump administration risks squandering the progress it has made by conducting raids on workplaces and neighborhoods throughout the country, such as the disastrous crackdown it began five weeks ago in Chicago. These raids — rounding up people who often have lived here for decades, raised families, held jobs and committed no crimes beyond lacking proper documentation — are economically unwise, socially destructive and morally wrong.

The raids remove workers from businesses that rely on them. They erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they police. And they separate families.

While Democrats must denounce these raids, we do need a crackdown — on the cartels. The cartels and the human traffickers known as coyotes who work for them teach migrants to exploit loopholes in our immigration law and deliberately overwhelm our asylum system. In the chaos, they smuggle drugs, traffic people and expand their grip on both sides of the border.

I recently visited the southern border in Arizona with a bipartisan group of fellow U.S. representatives. We met with immigration officials, law enforcement officers, Border Patrol agents and intelligence officers, all of whom issued the same warning: Though the border is officially closed to asylum seekers between the ports of entry, the cartels and coyotes are still hard at work, spreading false promises and luring families north.

The cartels are well organized, well funded, tech-savvy transnational enterprises. Fighting them at the border requires investing in drones, movement sensors, physical barriers and rapid-response units. It requires continuing to support the joint task force that is working to disrupt their financial networks and their leadership. It requires using law enforcement resources wisely: Every federal officer who is focused on arresting a farmhand, factory worker or landscaper could be better used to fight the cartels.

The Trump administration’s crackdown in Chicago is also a reminder that only Congress can permanently fix our immigration system. It cannot be done by executive orders, presidential decrees, lawsuits or agency directives. One president can issue an order, the next can reverse it. Judges can block policies or gut them. Cabinet officials can change enforcement priorities overnight. That’s not real leadership; it’s political theater.

Instead, we need legislation — ideally bipartisan. Lawmakers should reform our asylum system, which hasn’t been meaningfully updated in decades, so that it works quickly, fairly and with finality. Legitimate claims should be honored; meritless ones should be resolved swiftly with deportation.

Lawmakers should also fix our guest worker programs and create earned legal status for longtime residents. The border needs to be secure, but children should not live in fear of losing their parents to a midnight raid and families that have built lives here deserve the chance to earn legal status.

These reforms would also reduce cartel profits, stabilize labor markets and give employers greater certainty.

Meaningful change requires that Republicans acknowledge the economic and humanitarian necessity of immigration and that Democrats grant the necessity of secure borders and the deportation of violent offenders. Neither open borders nor mass deportation is a serious solution. What we need is smart law enforcement, secure borders, a modernized asylum system, a clear and fair path to legalization and a relentless focus on dismantling the cartels.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19suozzi-mfjc/19suozzi-mfjc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 09:01:53.947046

The big picture: Previously relegated to niche online communities like the HistoryMemes Reddit, the Third Amendment is receiving almost as much attention as its big siblings, the First and Second Amendments.

Context: The Third Amendment prohibits the forcible housing of the military in a civilians' house during peacetime, and requires any change to that status to be codified by law during times of war.

The amendment is ""not considered controversial"" and its merits have never been litigated before the Supreme Court, according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute.

The Amendment specifically pertains to civilians' homes, but social media users are tying it to other types of personal property as well.

Driving the news: Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin slammed the way Noem was turned away from a Chicago municipal building while on her way to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in an emailed statement to Axios.

""She didn't ask for a meeting. She asked to use the restroom. This is insane.""

State of play: The Trump administration rolled back restrictions on immigration enforcement in churches, hospitals and schools earlier this year, opening the floodgates for officers to access traditionally safe spaces to conduct raids.

The rollback has confused staffers unaccustomed to navigating law enforcement demands while adhering to industry protocols.

What they're saying: Adam Abadir, who led a Maryland public health campaign using memes, told Axios in a phone interview that social media is increasingly being used to ""make what should be intolerable, tolerable.""

""It's almost as if we are being asked to process things that are very serious, that are very concerning, in a way that is supposed to be seen as funny,"" he said.

""These types of communication channels are extremely effective. It just depends on the person that's using them.""

Zoom in: The memes keep coming. Users have remarked how they never expected to need their knowledge of the Third Amendment from history classes, and apologized to the Founding Fathers for not seeing their vision.

From gifs that portray Michael Jordan as the Third Amendment dunking on federal agents, to Lord of the Rings protagonist Gandalf preparing for battle, the memes span multiple fan universes.

Zoom out: Trump's preference for using federal troops as civilian law enforcement has repeatedly spurred ""Third Amendment absolutists"" to the front of American politics.

When Trump unexpectedly deployed troops to Los Angeles earlier this year with minimal preparation, troops reportedly had to sleep on the ground with little food, fuel, or water while the administration figured out their arrangements, prompting several social media users to make 3A jokes about how the troops weren't wanted.

She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order.","The Trump administration says it has paused work on only a small share of the roughly 4,000 mass layoffs announced since Oct. 1, in order to comply with a court order.

That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday.

Friday's court filing came amid a legal fight between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call ""politically driven RIFs,"" or reductions in force.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause.

As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with ""an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.""

In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.

At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices – or are expected to in the near future – are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs have members or bargaining units.

In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to ""err on the side of caution.""

She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding ""We ought not make it worse.""

The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order.

The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.

In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions.

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his declaration to the court about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown.

""HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,"" he wrote. ""Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.""

During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.

The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.

Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing.

At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as ""ready, fire, aim"" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding ""to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.""

In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston ""another far left, partisan judge.""

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs ""an unfortunate consequence"" of the government shutdown.

OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect.

While the White House promised ""substantial"" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January.

Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary.

That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates.

Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's ""Fork in the Road"" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2364x1330+0+246/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F0a%2Fc1bf8e494d09bf8efdd61a21b938%2Fgettyimages-2238023122.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 06:57:00.658123

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported.","When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.

Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.

“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”

One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”

And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”

During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.

Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.

And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.

One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”

The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.

The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.

The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.

The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.

Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.

“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”

Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”

“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.

In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.

“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.

McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”

“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.

Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.

The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.

“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

“Authoritarian Playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.

“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”

Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.

And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”

U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

Where the Fallout is Felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.

The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”

Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.

“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”

In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.

“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.

In Plain Sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.

Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”

With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.

On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”

The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.

Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.

Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.

“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”

Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.

“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.

Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.

National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission (Dec. 9) – Whether a federal law limiting coordinated party expenditures violates the First Amendment.","The Supreme Court announced on Friday afternoon that it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 8 in the battle over the president’s power to remove the heads of independent federal agencies created by Congress. The case, Trump v. Slaughter, is one of eight cases scheduled for oral argument during the court’s December argument calendar, which runs from Dec. 1-3 and again from Dec. 8-10. Other high-profile cases now slated for argument in December include National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission and First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin.

The dispute over presidential power began in March, when Rebecca Slaughter received an email notifying her that she had been removed from her position as one of the five members of the Federal Trade Commission. Under federal law, commissioners can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” but the email did not indicate that she had been fired for one of these reasons.

Federal courts in Washington, D.C., ordered the Trump administration to reinstate Slaughter. They pointed to the Supreme Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, which held that Congress can create independent, multi-member regulatory agencies, like the FTC, whose members can only be removed “for cause.”

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court in early September, seeking permission to fire Slaughter while the litigation continued. By a vote of 6-3, the justices agreed to put the lower court’s order requiring Slaughter’s reinstatement on hold.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, the justices will decide whether to overrule a 2001 decision that upheld federal limits on coordinated campaign expenditures, which bar political parties from spending money on campaign advertising with input from political candidates. The case was brought by (among others) then-Sen. J.D. Vance, contending that the federal law at the center of the case violates the First Amendment.

Mashable operates a digital news and entertainment website that publishes articles and multimedia content online. The plaintiff alleged that Mashable disclosed the IP addresses and device identifiers of its website visitors to Microsoft and other third parties in violation of CIPA.

Case History

The plaintiff alleged that Mashable’s website embedded third-party trackers from Microsoft and others which collected users’ IP addresses and device information, transmitting that data to third parties for advertising and profiling. The plaintiff argued these trackers function as “pen registers” under CIPA. The Pen Register Act (the chapter of CIPA at issue) prohibits installing or using any device or process that records addressing information from electronic communications without a court order.

Mashable’s Arguments

Mashable moved to dismiss, contending that the Pen Register Act, applies only to person-to-person communications such as phone calls or emails, not to general website activity. It further argued that the complaint did not plausibly allege a violation and that the CIPA statute is ambiguous and should be interpreted narrowly under the rule of lenity– a legal principle that requires courts to interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants. Mashable also asserted that pending Senate Bill 690 indicates the California Legislature’s disagreement with the plaintiff’s interpretation of the Pen Register Act.

Court’s Reasoning and Decision

The court rejected Mashable’s arguments and found that the Pen Register Act’s language is intentionally broad, covering any “device or process” that records addressing information. Pen Register is defined as a “device or process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of a communication.” Hinging on the inclusion of “process” in the definition, the court held that this definition was intended to encompass software trackers embedded in websites, not just traditional telephone hardware. According to the court, “[w]hat matters under the statute is not the form of the tool, but rather the function.”

The court further held that a user’s visit to a website, which involves transmitting an HTTP request containing IP and device data, constitutes an “electronic communication” under the statute. The court likened an IP address to a telephone number, as “quintessential ‘addressing’ information…[that] identifies the device sending the communication and determines where the packet is to be routed.”

In addition, the court found that Mashable’s role in embedding trackers and using the resulting data was sufficient to plead “installation” and “use” under CIPA, even if third-party vendors operated the trackers. The court held that, even if the trackers were operated by a third party, Mashable embedded the trackers onto its website and used the data captured from them to facilitate targeted advertising.

Moreover, the court found the statute clear enough in its “language, structure, history and purpose” to apply to the conduct alleged and declined to apply the rule of lenity. It also held that S.B. 690 is not persuasive evidence because it has not passed and “[the] Court must apply the statute as it currently exists.”

Implications

This decision significantly broadens the scope of CIPA compliance risk for website operators in California. By holding that the Pen Register Act applies to modern web tracking technologies, such as embedded third-party trackers that collect and transmit IP addresses and device identifiers, the court clarified that CIPA is not limited to traditional telephone or direct person-to-person communications. Any website embedding third-party advertising or analytics tools that record user “addressing” information could face similar exposure, even if the trackers are managed and operated by external vendors. Importantly, the court’s dismissal of the rule of lenity and disregard for pending legislative amendments further signal that California courts are leaning toward expansive interpretations of digital privacy statutes.

Takeaways

Website operators, especially those with significant California user bases, should reassess their use of tracking technologies and the sharing of user data with third parties. Compliance strategies should include conducting thorough audits of all embedded trackers, understanding what information is collected, ensuring appropriate disclosures, and evaluating the legal basis for any data-sharing practices. The court’s emphasis on function over form warns that simply relying on vendor installation or technical outsourcing does not insulate companies from liability under CIPA. In this environment, proactive reviews of privacy practices and ongoing legal monitoring are critical, not only to limit exposure in potential CIPA litigation, but also to align with evolving regulatory and judicial expectations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15533_134.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 10:57:53.148890

The video recorded by Mari Magana and posted on Facebook showed the moment ICE agents kicked down the bedroom door in the family’s apartment in Gresham, approximately 17 miles outside of Portland, Wednesday evening. The video has been shared across social media.

The baby’s grandmother, Gloria Bautista, told The Independent that her daughter has been left shaken by the ordeal.

“The mother is so traumatized that anything scares her, she's shaking all the time,” she said.

Two male relatives in the room were detained by ICE agents in the confrontation, where an agent appeared to grab one of them by the hair and pull him backward out of the room. The two suspects have been taken to a detention center in nearby Tacoma, Washington.

A senior Department of Homeland Security official told The Independent that “no injuries were sustained” in the operation, which was targeting “a previously removed violent criminal illegal alien from Mexico” who remains at large.

“ICE officers attempted to pull this criminal illegal alien over in a vehicle stop,” the official said. “He attempted to evade arrest and rammed into a United States Postal Service vehicle before fleeing on foot into an apartment. After refusals to come out, law enforcement entered the apartment.”

“The target escaped and remains at-large,” the official added. “Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene.”

The family claimed the men who were detained are in the U.S. legally.

Magana filmed the moment ICE agents kicked the door down because they had been attempting to enter the property for hours, according to Latino news outlet Noticias Noroeste NW.

""It’s a lofty goal, but it starts with us exercising our right to peacefully protest.""","Amid President Donald Trump's unprecedented and accelerating attacks on US democracy, millions of Americans in every state and beyond are preparing to take to the streets Saturday for a second wave of No Kings rallies.

In what organizers and participants say might be the ""largest protest in US history"" in a single day, No Kings demonstrations are set to take place in more than 2,500 communities across the nation, from its biggest cities to small towns like Burns, Oregon—population 2,700—and Bryson City, North Carolina, with 1,500 residents.

The first round of No Kings rallies, held on June 14, drew an estimated 4-6 million participants to over 2,100 demonstrations. Organizers say that the October 18 protest could be even bigger, as Americans are more alarmed than ever by the assault on democracy by Trump and Republicans.

""What we’re seeing is truly unprecedented,"" Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told Common Dreams. ""What we’re seeing from this administration is authoritarian slip. We are seeing them attack judges, attack nonprofits, trying to attack the media, stifle First Amendment protected speech, and arrest sitting members of Congress for doing their oversight of [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].""

""The list, unfortunately, is very long and what we want is what we’ve seen in other countries that have successfully resisted authoritarianism—to hold on to our democracy and to create and protect the checks that we have against that kind of executive overreach,"" she added. ""It’s a lofty goal, but it starts with us exercising our right to peacefully protest.""

As Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson (La.)—who called Saturday's pro-democracy demonstrations ""hate America"" rallies—attempt to smear the No Kings movement, organizer Sarah Parker of 50501 and Voices of Florida said during a Thursday press conference that ""we have a saying in the South: A hit dog will holler, and I’m hearing a lot of noise from Washington, DC right now.""

""And with that said, on October 18 millions of people just like me... are going to take the streets peacefully and say there will be no kings in America,"" she continued.

""These are everyday Americans coming together to organize,"" Parker said. ""These are faith leaders, teachers, veterans, small business owners who are being impacted by extremely dubious tariffs. These are people that are seeing their friends and family members be kidnapped off the streets. These are everyday Americans that are struggling to put groceries into their fridge, and these are Millennials and Gen Zers who were promised a beautiful and free America.""

""They are rising to this moment because they feel… it is their obligation to joyfully and peacefully push back against authoritarianism like the generations that came before us,"" she added.

Jamie Contreras, the executive vice president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 32BJ who is also a US Navy veteran and former undocumented immigrant, told the press conference that ""America belongs to the people—working people—not to billionaires or a few politicians who think they can rule like kings.""

Addressing the Trump administration's designation of leftist protesters as ""terrorists"" and its ominous threat to take the ""same approach"" to them as to the alleged drug traffickers it is extrajudicially assassinating on the high seas, Contreras said that ""the real threat to this country isn’t peaceful protesters, it’s politicians shutting down our government to protect billionaires and corporate greed.""

""What’s ironic to me is, you call peaceful protesters terrorists, but then the [January 6 insurrectionists] patriots,"" he added. ""That’s so ironic and so far from the truth.""

The federal government shut down at the beginning of the month, and as Democrats and Republicans continued to spar over the GOP's healthcare cuts, Johnson warned this week that it could be the longest shutdown ever.

Indivisible co-founder Leah Greenberg told the press conference: ""Republicans are blaming and smearing millions of Americans who are peacefully protesting because they have run out of excuses for their own failures. Republicans understand that Americans are blaming them for the shutdown, Americans are blaming them for out-of-control healthcare prices, and a rising affordability crisis.""

Greenberg continued:

They are blaming them for the fear and chaos gripping the country. They are panicking and they are flailing and they are searching for anything, literally anything, to distract from their governing failures. And in their desperation they have decided to go with smearing millions of Americans who are coming out to peacefully, directly assert our rights. It is both ridiculous and outrageous. It is ridiculous because it is transparently false, it is outrageous because it is an attack on the First Amendment and on all of our right to free speech.

Parker said Republicans ""are refusing to accept the fact that the American people are pissed, by the millions. They are refusing to accept the fact that their actions are harming our beloved country. They are refusing to look in the mirror and accept the fact that they are destroying America.""

ACLU chief political and advocacy officer Deidre Schifeling said during the press conference that ""President Trump and his allies are abusing their power and attempting to scare their own citizens away from exercising our rights and freedoms.""

""What we have seen so far is as troubling as it is illegal,"" Schifeling continued. ""The Trump administration has directed ICE to kidnap people including journalists and students off the street, ripping them from their families and deporting them without due process.""

""Their allies are attempting to undermine fair elections at President Trump’s direction by redistricting voting maps and further gerrymandering states,"" she noted. ""And they are attempting to limit our First Amendment rights and use the federal government to attack political rivals, stifle dissent, and undermine checks and balances on presidential power.""

""The Trump administration has even deployed armed agents and troops into American cities, including my home of Washington, DC, turning our streets into militarized zones and threatening to do so again to quash Saturday’s protests,"" she said.

""You have to ask: Why are they so afraid of their own citizens?"" Schifeling said. ""Well, they know that their agenda of selling fear, division, misinformation, lawbreaking, and violence is deeply unpopular. Millions of Americans will peacefully protest on Saturday to tell the Trump administration that we are a country of equals, we are a country of laws that apply to everyone, of due process, and of democracy.""

""We will not be silenced,"" she added. ""If we stop exercising our rights, our First Amendment freedom of speech out of fear, we forfeit our power in advance. The best way to protect our freedom is to act free.""

Gilbert told Common Dreams: ""I think we can turn this around. I think we wouldn’t be doing this if we couldn’t. We are still in a democracy today, we’re having this free and fair conversation right now, you and I… and we have a set of protections we can exercise and we need to remind people what democracy is supposed to look like.""

As Contreras said, ""When working people stand together, no king, no billionaires, no politicians can stop us.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.png?id=61613286&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C78%2C0%2C78,N,,2025-10-18 07:57:00.288946

U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston said during an emergency hearing the restraining order affects any agency that has employees who are members of the unions that brought the lawsuit or are in collective bargaining units.

The Trump administration choosing not to recognize those union activities based on an earlier executive order doesn’t mean an agency can issue layoff notices, she said.

Illston, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, specifically said the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services must comply with the TRO and cannot issue Reductions in Force, or RIFs.

“It is not complicated,” Illston said. “During this time these agencies should not be doing RIFs of the protected folks that we're talking about.”

She also added the National Federation of Federal Employees, Service Employees International Union and National Association of Government Employees, Inc. to the lawsuit and the temporary restraining order.

Meanwhile, as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 extends with no end in sight, administration officials said they will freeze $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects and furlough Energy Department employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration.

Unions argue administration ignoring part of judge’s order

The California case was originally brought by the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing those unions, said during the hearing the Trump administration had been “overly narrowly interpreting the scope of the TRO and ignoring some of the language in the TRO.”

Leonard pointed to a brief filed by the Department of Health and Human Services that said the agency hadn’t issued any layoff notices to workers covered by the TRO, even though an earlier filing to the court said HHS had sent notices to 982 employees.

That department, Leonard said, appeared to take the position that an earlier executive order ended all union representation at HHS.

“The government is well aware that is a disputed issue,” Leonard said.

Elizabeth Hedges, counsel for the Trump administration, said after considerable back and forth that she didn’t agree with Leonard and the judge’s interpretation of the temporary restraining order’s impact.

“I would submit that’s not what the TRO says,” Hedges said, though she later told the judge she would make sure the administration complied with the updated explanation of the restraining order.

Hedges also told the judge the Interior Department didn’t previously disclose it was contemplating layoffs because officials began considering those RIFs before the shutdown and were only going to implement them during the shutdown because it’s gone on so long.

The judge ordered the Trump administration to tell the court by 9 a.m. Pacific on Monday about any actual or imminent layoff notices under the full scope of the restraining order.

Army Corps to pause billions in big-city projects

White House budget director Russ Vought announced hours before the emergency court hearing the administration plans to freeze and may unilaterally cancel billions more in funding approved by Congress.

“The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,” Vought wrote in a social media post. “The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. More information to come from the Army Corps of Engineers.”

The Trump administration has been cited several times by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office for not spending money approved by Congress as lawmakers intended.

Generally, after Congress approves a spending bill and it becomes law, the president is supposed to faithfully implement its provisions.

Any president that wants to cancel funding lawmakers already approved is supposed to send Congress a rescissions request, which starts a 45-day clock for members to approve, modify, or ignore the request.

The Trump administration followed that legal pathway earlier this year when it asked Congress to cancel billions in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid.

The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, approved the request after senators preserved full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

The White House budget office sent up another rescissions request in late August, asking lawmakers to cancel billions of additional spending on foreign aid programs.

Neither chamber has taken action to approve that request, but Vought believes that since it was sent up within the last 45 days of the fiscal year, he is allowed to cancel that funding without congressional action.

The GAO and Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, have both called the maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, unlawful.

Nuclear security workers to be furloughed

The Trump administration also announced Friday that it would have more than 1,000 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration stop working for the remainder of the shutdown, joining hundreds of thousands of others on furlough. According to its website, the NNSA’s job “is to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing.”

An Energy Department spokesperson wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “approximately 1,400 NNSA federal employees will be furloughed as of Monday, October 20th and nearly 400 NNSA federal employees will continue to work to support the protection of property and the safety of human life. NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation remains funded through October 27, 2025.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the spokesperson said, “will be in Las Vegas, Nevada and at the National Nuclear Security Site Monday to further discuss the impacts of the shutdown on America’s nuclear deterrent.""",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-10/cvcclosed_1.jpg?h=479e7bf5&itok=YyEv3QVo,N,,2025-10-18 12:57:37.414820

By Andy Worthington, October 17, 2025

Since its founding in January 2012, marking the 10th anniversary of the opening of the ""war on terror"" prison at Guantánamo Bay, the Close Guantánamo campaign has persistently called for freedom and/or justice for the men held there, struggling against indifference under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, but shut out completely under Donald Trump, who, in his first term in office, disregarded the remaining prisoners so thoroughly that, for four years, it was as though they had been entombed.

In the eight and a half baleful months since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the 15 ""war on terror"" prisoners still held at the prison (down from 40 in his first term) have, predictably, largely disappeared from view, made invisible as the would-be tyrannical president sprung a miserable surprise on everyone, seizing on the naval base as a venue for perforative cruelty in the ""war on migrants"" that he declared when he took office, promising what Human Rights First has accurately described as ""an unprecedented mass deportation agenda.""

On January 29, out of nowhere, Trump ordered the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, via a ""Presidential Action,"" to make preparations to hold up to 30,000 migrants there — plans which, fortunately, never materialized.

Beginning in February, however, the first of what, to date, have been just over 700 migrants held at Guantánamo were flown to the naval base from detention facilities on the U.S. mainland run by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), part of the Department of Homeland Security, both of which were created in 2003 as part of the domestic response to post-9/11 paranoia. No one at the time could have had any idea that one day they would get embroiled with Guantánamo, which was so clearly the territory of the military.

Some of these migrants were held in an existing Migrant Operations Center, used to hold migrants intercepted at sea since the 1990s, with others held, illegally, in Camp 6 of the ""war on terror"" prison, which, by law, can only be used to hold prisoners allegedly seized in connection with the 9/11 attacks, Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.

Faced with legal challenges, Trump disposed of all of the first migrants held at Guantánamo — 178 Venezuelans — within weeks, sending all but one back to Venezuela. In the months that followed, however, more migrants continued to arrive, in smaller numbers, and from a variety of countries, although they too were all subsequently deported or returned to the U.S. mainland.

In June, reports emerged that Trump was once more threatening to massively increase the migrant population at Guantánamo, allegedly planning to send 9,000 men there, including 800 Europeans. I speculated at the time that the news had been an internal leak, designed to get the plans dropped via the fury of European leaders, who, as anticipated, in many cases vociferously complained in public about this flagrant affront to diplomacy.

The arrival and subsequent disappearance of migrants at Guantánamo reportedly convicted of serious crimes

In July, however, further disturbing news emerged, establishing that, at the time, 72 migrants were held, with 26 of them singled out for particular attention by the Department of Homeland Security, which published a hysterically-entitled list, describing them as the ""Worst of the Worst Convicted Criminal Illegal Aliens,"" and giving their names, their nationalities, and the alleged crimes for which they had allegedly been convicted (no actual proof was provided). The men came from a variety of countries, mainly in Central and South America and South East Asia, although they also included individuals from the U.K. and Romania.

The decision to focus on alleged convicts had evidently arisen because the administration had been repeatedly humiliated, exposed time and again lying about most of the men it had been seizing, routinely describing them as gang members and ""heinous criminals"" based on nothing more than the fact that they had tattoos. In case after case, exposed by lawyers, investigators and journalists, their family members had established that their only ""crime"" had been to undertake perilous journeys to seek work in the promised land of the USA.

The decision to focus on alleged convicts was particularly disturbing because it coincided with the administration’s successful efforts to deport migrants not to their home countries, but to third countries (namely, South Sudan and Eswatini), with none of the guarantees required under international humanitarian law to ensure that they would not be abused, tortured, ""disappeared,"" or even killed.

Nevertheless, despite my best efforts to promote the precarious position these 26 men at Guantánamo were in, no one at all followed up on the story, attempts to chase leads led nowhere, and the story soon sank without trace.

It was only on October 2 that Carol Rosenberg of the New York Times reported that all of the migrants held over the summer had been removed, with none remaining at all.

As Rosenberg explained, on October 1 the last 18 migrants held were removed on a charter flight to the U.S. mainland. As she stated, ""Their final destinations were not known, but immigration authorities have in the past moved migrants back to the United States to consolidate deportation flights.""

Further elucidating the story of the migrants held over the summer, Rosenberg explained that, at the end of July, 61 migrants were held, but that, since then, 16 ICE flights had ""picked up deportees, to either return them to the United States or to add to flights already loaded with other migrants and continue on to other countries.""

She added that, according to Thomas Cartwright, who tracks deportations with the immigrant rights group Witness at the Border, ""Their destinations included Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, England, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Laos, Nigeria, Romania, St. Kitt, Sierra Leone and Vietnam.""

Some of these deportations undoubtedly included the 26 men on the list published by the DHS, most notably the British national, although as with his arrival at Guantánamo, and his imprisonment over the summer, there has never been any mention of him in any British media outlet at all.

Once upon a time, a British national held at Guantánamo, even one allegedly convicted of paedophilia, would have been a major news story, but now it’s lost in a vortex of media indifference and the perma-chaos of Trump’s insane rule.

I can only wonder how many other troubling stories are not even being noticed at all.

More migrants arrive at Guantánamo

Unfortunately, on October 14, Rosenberg provided an update regarding the migrant situation at Guantánamo, noting that she had been told by a Defense Department official that about 20 more migrants had arrived at the naval base, although no further details — about their nationalities, for example — were provided.

Every time the naval base is emptied of migrants, I hope that the Trump administration will finally have taken note of some of the main reasons why using it is so inappropriate — the colossal costs involved, for example, or the evident illegality of using it to hold anyone detained in connection with civil immigration matters.

Every time, however, the administration’s contempt for propriety and the law wins out.

Later this month, however, a federal judge in the District Court in Washington, D.C. will finally hear a case, Luna Gutierrez v. Noem, which was submitted in June by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP).

In their submission in June, lawyers for ""all immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be held at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay, Cuba"" argued that all these individuals ""do not challenge the government’s authority to detain them on U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or to another statutorily authorized country. What they challenge is the government’s unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guantánamo — which, under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act], and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.""

As the lawyers added, ""Moreover, the government’s use of Guantánamo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.""

In addition, as they stated, ""Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so. The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States.""

It is to be hoped that, when the hearing takes place and a ruling is handed down, it will be another blow against the monstrous overreach and illegality of this particularly cruel and disdainful administration.

However, even if this is the outcome, and the ruling survives further appeals, 2025 will go down in history as the year that, in a cynically constructed policy echoing the lawless indignities of the Bush administration’s ""war on terror,"" Donald Trump and senior officials in his administration — Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, Pete Hegseth, and numerous devious legal advisers — conspired to replicate the horrors and lawlessness of the post-9/11 period not on foreign Muslims seized abroad, but on hapless migrants seized on the U.S. mainland.

And they did so not because there had been any great tragedy like 9/11, but simply because of their deep and revolting racism.",https://www.closeguantanamo.org/statics.1/img/favicon.png,N,,2025-10-18 12:03:05.678875

Krawzak,,,,,https://rollcall.com/2025/10/17/military-pay-move-puts-congress-in-the-back-seat-on-spending/,"“President Trump has been ignoring Congress’ authority to say which funds should be spent since the early days of this administration.
He is now increasingly disregarding the requirement of an appropriation before spending money,” said David Super, a Georgetown Law professor and expert in federal budget law.
Trump’s official legal justification is that the Pentagon is using funds that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth determined have a “reasonable, logical relationship” to military pay and benefits.
That “reasonable, logical” connection would be “consistent with applicable law,” including the so-called purpose statute, Trump’s directive released Wednesday says.
The official said the military is a special category within the government that Congress always intended to keep fully funded.","It’s been a year full of money grabs by an executive branch that puts less weight on Congress’ “power of the purse” than any since the Nixon administration.

But President Donald Trump’s latest budget maneuver — paying military salaries out of unrelated research funding — has so openly flouted federal law as to make lawmakers’ appropriations authority, and Congress itself, practically irrelevant, critics argue.

“President Trump has been ignoring Congress’ authority to say which funds should be spent since the early days of this administration. He is now increasingly disregarding the requirement of an appropriation before spending money,” said David Super, a Georgetown Law professor and expert in federal budget law.

“This renders the appropriations process essentially meaningless if the president continues along this course,” Super said.

Trump’s official legal justification is that the Pentagon is using funds that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth determined have a “reasonable, logical relationship” to military pay and benefits.

That “reasonable, logical” connection would be “consistent with applicable law,” including the so-called purpose statute, Trump’s directive released Wednesday says. That’s a longstanding part of federal budget law requiring that appropriations “shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.”

In an interview, a senior administration official fleshed out what they argue is the reasonable, logical use of unspent R&D funds to pay the troops.

The official said the military is a special category within the government that Congress always intended to keep fully funded. But because appropriations for military personnel accounts expired Sept. 30, the Pentagon had to tap unspent funds that have not yet expired to keep funding the military during a shutdown.

R&D accounts were the obvious place to find this money, given their two-year availability, and one logical connection is that personnel are needed to conduct that research, development, testing and evaluation that those accounts pay for.

‘Pale in comparison’

The argument doesn’t pass the smell test with critics on either side of the aisle, who argue it is simply an illegal power grab.

G. William Hoagland, a longtime Senate GOP budget aide, said Trump’s budget moves are “without precedent” and that President Richard Nixon’s flouting of spending directives — which led to the landmark 1974 budget law’s enactment — “pale in comparison.”

The 1974 law created the modern controls on presidential “impoundments,” requiring the executive branch to obligate funds consistent with enacted appropriations laws — unless Congress passes legislation rescinding certain funds identified by the president.

This year, Congress passed one such rescissions package. But Trump’s budget office has taken heat for freezing appropriated funds using its “apportionment” authority, or responsibility to ensure money isn’t burned through too quickly. In some cases, funding freezes have been blocked in court.

In one high-profile case that’s currently at the Supreme Court, Trump employed what’s known as a “pocket rescission,” or a loophole in the 1974 law requiring Congress to approve rescission requests within 45 days. In this case, the Trump OMB put a hold on $5 billion in foreign assistance funds within 45 days of Sept. 30, when the money expired.

Critics were already up in arms over that move, saying it’s a violation of impoundment law that basically neuters the power of the purse. Now, Trump has gone even further, they say.

Georgetown Law’s Super pointed out that OMB Director Russ Vought, the architect of Trump’s impoundment strategy, has argued that the 1974 law doesn’t require presidents to spend every penny of an appropriation. The law puts a ceiling on that spending, rather than setting a floor, Vought says.

Now, Super said, Trump “apparently does not even believe that” and instead contends the administration is free to spend money it doesn’t have or for purposes Congress did not intend.

Constitutional principles

The purpose statute is separate from the Antideficiency Act, which bars the administration from spending money in excess of available appropriations and is another cornerstone of federal budget law.

The ADA is what requires the government to “shut down” during a funding lapse, other than special “excepted” functions critical to public safety and security, and programs that don’t rely on annual appropriations.

But the purpose statute is considered an equally bedrock constitutional principle, with its roots in Article I: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”

The senior administration official argued tapping Pentagon R&D funds to pay the troops doesn’t run afoul of the ADA because there is clearly money available. It’s the “purpose” of it that’s in question, and Congress’ intention in providing Pentagon appropriations, including for two fiscal years, was to have a functioning military.

When there is a functioning military personnel account, that’s what would fund salaries, the White House argues. So when those accounts have no money, it has to come from somewhere else.

And the president’s constitutional duties as commander in chief adds to this being a special case, which Trump alluded to in his “national security memorandum” laying out the troop funding maneuver on Wednesday. The president has identified a need for that money to carry out his duty to defend the nation, the thinking goes.

Other factors in the decision: the Pentagon couldn’t use “general transfer authority” to simply shift the R&D money into personnel accounts, because of a restriction on transferring money into expired accounts.

In addition, there’s a constitutional roadblock to tapping Pentagon funds appropriated in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation package (PL 119-21), which many expected would be the source of cash to pay the troops.

Article I restricts Congress’ power “to raise and support Armies” to appropriations that are available for no more than two years, as the R&D funds appropriated in the fiscal 2025 spending law are. The money appropriated in reconciliation is available for five years, making that a no-go.

‘King’ Trump?

It’s such a politically unassailable move — ensuring the troops got paid on time, despite the shutdown — that the Trump administration knew going in that any on-the-record critiques would lead to swift recriminations.

Predictably, no Democrats have stepped up to publicly oppose the funding shift in and of itself. But some question the legality of it and argue it further undermines trust in the appropriations process.

“I don’t know that he’s got legal authority … to do any of this,” Sen. Christopher S. Murphy, D-Conn., said Thursday. “We all want to pay the troops, but … these complicated schemes to pay the troops that he’s using is just evidence of how badly they want to avoid negotiations.”

Even some Republicans are chafing a little at the erosion of lawmakers’ authority.

“It’s always preferable that Congress not only be consulted, but when it comes to appropriations, the Constitution requires the appropriations to be done by Congress,” said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., who like Murphy is a senior Appropriations Committee member.

Bobby Kogan, a former Democratic budget aide, said Trump’s move to pay the troops using money that wasn’t appropriated for that purpose is “going to further neuter and further destroy our appropriations process.”

“At this point Trump is an appropriations king; he gets to do whatever he wants,” said Kogan, now with the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

As for Appropriations Committee members, Kogan said: “Obviously they have an existential question for themselves about what their job is.”

The demonstrations are expected to bring thousands of Michigan residents to the streets, for the second time this year.

Trump has taken several steps challenging the extent of his powers and presidential norms. His approval rating has remained around 40%, with some pollsters reporting a few points higher, according to recent polls.

Here's a look at why people protesting President Trump's policies.

Why are people protesting Trump?

Since taking office in January, Trump's actions in his second term are redefining executive power and challenging presidential norms.

Partners under the No Kings banner, which include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Michigan Climate Action Network, are protesting the president for a multitude of reasons including disagreement with immigration, foreign policy, federal spending cuts, civil rights, reproductive rights, the stripping of diversity commitments, tariffs and climate change, among other things.

""In June, millions of everyday Americans from every walk of life peacefully took to the streets and declared with one voice: No Kings,"" the No Kings website says. ""The world saw the power of the people, and President Trump’s attempt at a coronation collapsed under the strength of a movement rising against his abuses of power.

""Now, he’s doubling down — sending militarized agents into our communities, silencing voters, and handing billionaires giveaways while families struggle,"" according to the No Kings website.

Why are many protesters wearing yellow?

According to No Kings, people have asked for a simple, shared way to show unity.

""Throughout history, people who have come together in protest against authoritarian regimes have utilized a color that is easy to see among a sea of thousands,"" No Kings explained. ""Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings.""

The group also pointed to Hong Kong, where protesters carried yellow umbrellas, and said yellow ribbons are emblems of hope, accountability and reform. Eastern Ukrainians' yellow ribbon movement is a sign of resistance against Russian aggression, the group added.

Where can I gather to protest?

Public areas, like streets, sidewalks and in front of government buildings, are open to protests as long as you are not blocking access or interfering with operations, the ACLU says.

How can I find a demonstration to join?

Lieff Professor of Law, Columbia Law School faculty experts Gillian Metzger, Elora Mukherjee, Kate Redburn, and Thomas P. Schmidt unpacked important Supreme Court decisions with a focus on rulings on the emergency docket—commonly called the “shadow docket”—which are issued outside of formal opinions.

Daniel Abebe, Dean and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Law, introduced the event and said that the timing of the Supreme Court’s rulings has created a tradition of faculty members providing analysis at the LCI SCOTUS Roundup early in the fall semester. This offers an opportunity to “leverage the fantastic expertise of our wonderful faculty,” who regularly provide commentary in the media about the court’s rulings and “play a central role in shaping the national conversation,” he said.

Federal Agency Independence

Emergency orders granted by the Supreme Court that allowed the removal of members of independent government agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), are part of a decade-and-a-half-long trend of the Roberts court invalidating regulatory schemes and administrative structures, said Gillian Metzger, Harlan Fiske Stone Professor of Constitutional Law.

“The Supreme Court, in its recent decisions, kept saying that it’s not overturning Humphrey’s Executor,” the 1935 ruling that prevents presidents from removing independent agency members from their positions except for cause, Metzger said. But in the NLRB and MSPB cases, the court reiterated its position in previous cases that “the president can remove those who exercise executive power on their behalf, subject to narrow exceptions,” she said.

Allowing the president more power to remove independent agency leadership, as the court’s recent decisions do, “has been the trend of the court’s decisions,” Metzger said. “What is a little bit surprising is [that] they were doing this against the backdrop of a president who was exercising pretty aggressive executive power. And it didn’t seem to stop them one inch.”

Immigration

Elora Mukherjee, Jerome L. Greene Clinical Professor of Law, spoke about four emergency docket immigration decisions: two that permitted the end of Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua; one that allowed deportations to South Sudan; and Noem v. Perdomo, an emergency ruling in which the court allowed immigration enforcement stops in Los Angeles to continue based on race or ethnicity, command of English, location, and type of job.

Mukherjee said that the rulings show that the Supreme Court is increasingly relying on the shadow docket “to issue hugely consequential immigration decisions without adequate reasoning—or any reasoning—and without letting lower court proceedings play out as they should.” Action by federal immigration authorities to detain and deport immigrants “is pushing the bounds of … executive authority well past the system of checks and balances that has been set up in our U.S. Constitution,” she said.

The Perdomo decision is “an invitation to law enforcement nationwide to engage in racial profiling,” Mukherjee said. “And through this one-paragraph decision on the shadow docket, the Supreme Court has turned America, our nation, into a show-me-your-papers nation where, depending on what you look like, you need to carry papers to prove that you belong in this country, and you should not be subject to summary deportation.” She added that the Supreme Court “has essentially become a rubber stamp for executive branch immigration policy, even policies that are clearly unconstitutional and illegal.”

Medical Care and Gender

U.S. v. Skrmetti upheld a Tennessee state law restricting medical care for transgender minors. The court found that the law applied to individuals based on age and medical treatment rather than on sex, which would have required a higher standard of review, said Associate Professor of Law Kate Redburn. As a result, the ruling “leaves open a lot of questions for both the rights of transgender people under the 14th Amendment but also the status of sex-based equal protection law in general,” Redburn said.

The scope of a “medical-context exception to sex classifications” is unclear, Redburn added, querying whether it could apply to “contraception or other kinds of sex-inflected medical regulation that’s not exclusive to trans people.”

Skrmetti did not cover what level of scrutiny would apply to a claim of transgender status discrimination, Redburn said. But, since the court has agreed to hear cases on the participation of transgender athletes on sports teams, “we'll probably have an answer to some of these open sex equality questions in the next year.”

Nationwide Injunctions

In Trump v. CASA Inc., the Supreme Court as a whole for the first time addressed the issue of universal injunctions in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump that sought to restrict birthright citizenship. The court ruled that lower courts could not issue universal injunctions that prohibit enforcement of executive actions beyond the plaintiffs before the court because that remedy was not available to the courts in the founding era.

Like emergency rulings from the highest court, universal—or nationwide—injunctions from lower courts jumped in 2025, said Associate Professor of Law Thomas P. Schmidt, with about 25 issued so far this year compared with more than 100 in the nation’s history. “Presidents of both parties, when in power, have challenged their propriety in court,” he said.

The birthright citizenship order had been blocked by lower courts, which issued universal injunctions against its implementation. In appealing to the Supreme Court, the administration did not argue that the executive order was lawful or defend it as consistent with the 14th Amendment, Schmidt said. “Instead, the only argument that the administration made to the Supreme Court was that the injunction granted by the courts below was too broad because it extended beyond the parties to the case.”",https://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/architectural_details_jrp0733_0130.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:01:59.446991

The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening.
The president is currently in a legal battle with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests.
Last month, Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were ""tremendous levels"" of crime in the city.
In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month.","The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois after lower courts blocked the deployment.

As legal challenges to President Trump's push to send military troops to Democratic-led cities make their way through several courts, the administration's appeal to the high court marks the first time the justices have been asked to weigh in on the issue.

In the appeal filed on Friday by the Department of Justice, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that troops are needed in the Chicago area to ""prevent ongoing and intolerable risks to the lives and safety"" of federal agents. The appeal comes a day after a federal judge denied Trump's bid to deploy troops in Illinois. Sauer argued that the judge's ruling ""improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.""

Trump has been arguing that Chicago is lawless and in need of military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, and federalized the state National Guard against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's wishes earlier this month. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also sent several hundred of his state's troops to the Democratic-led state.

The Trump administration is ""going to litigate this as much as we can,"" Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with ABC's This Week on Sunday. ""We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago.""

The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening.

President Trump has carried out, or attempted to carry out, similar plans in other cities while claiming that federal intervention is needed to drive down crime rates. Leaders in several of those cities have said military force is unnecessary and have accused the president of exceeding his authority to carry out such deployments.

The president is currently in a legal battle with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has argued that Trump broke the law by not consulting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Last month, Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were ""tremendous levels"" of crime in the city. He is also in litigation with the city of Portland, Ore., after attempting to send troops there to safeguard ICE facilities that he said were being attacked. A judge has issued an order blocking the deployment.

In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month. Shortly before the emergency expired, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the city had established the Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center to manage and continue its relationship with federal law enforcement. The office is responsible, in part, for communicating D.C.'s requests to the federal agents, such as that they not wear masks and that they clearly identify themselves during arrests and interactions with the public.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday confirmed Hott, whom it said was serving in Chicago on an interim basis, is heading back to D.C. as part of a “planned return” to resume his permanent post as field operations director there.

That shift was revealed in a footnote included in a new filing Friday morning by the Trump administration in an ongoing lawsuit over the continued use of tear gas and other so-called “riot control” weapons by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Illinois.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis on Thursday said she was “not happy,” a week after she granted a temporary restraining order barring the use of such weapons against journalists, protesters and anyone not posing an immediate threat to immigration enforcement agents.

The lawsuit was brought after a series of clashes between protesters and agents at ICE’s processing center in suburban Broadview. But since Ellis issued her order, agents have deployed tear gas multiple times in Chicago, including in Albany Park last weekend and following a collision Tuesday between Border Patrol agents and another vehicle on the city’s Southeast Side.

“There’s a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” Ellis said Thursday, suggesting the tense situation resulted from Border Patrol agents using tactics not appropriate in the nation’s third-largest city.

“We’re not on the border. We are in an urban, densely populated area where crowds are going to converge when there’s a commotion, where appropriate crowd control is important,” she said. “Trying to apprehend and detain people is very, very different when you’re in an urban setting than when you’re out on the border.”

Ellis demanded that Hott appear in court next Monday morning in order to “explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”

But in a new filing Friday, the Department of Justice asked Ellis to reconsider, stating it has since learned of Hott’s departure and offered instead the appearance of Kyle C. Harvick, a Border Patrol deputy incident commander working under the ongoing “Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

During a brief phone hearing Friday afternoon, Ellis said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government intends to present at Monday’s hearing, but added she’s been “very clear” that she wants to hear from someone who can shed more light on “what’s been going on over the last week.”

“Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” she said. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”

The DOJ claims that the presence of Harvick, rather than Hott, would be more appropriate after DHS determined that it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in those recent tear gas incidents.

In response, attorneys from the law firm of Loevy & Loevy — which represents the journalists and protesters who brought the lawsuit — noted the timeline of Hott’s sudden departure shortly after he was asked to appear in court.

“How convenient,” attorney David Owens wrote in a filing Friday.

“Plaintiffs object because the government should not be allowed to play a game of hot potato with its different agencies using force against civilians in this District,” they continued. “This Court should order Hott to appear as an ICE supervisor, particularly given that the government has not represented in its filing that ICE was uninvolved.”

Ellis on Thursday also said she intended to expand her existing restraining order, requiring all federal agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz and who have body cameras to have them on during encounters with protesters.

On Friday, she said that decision was not “up for debate” and that she would be amending that order to add in that new requirement immediately.

“This was not a suggestion,” she said. “It wasn’t a hint, it wasn’t a topic of conversion. It was an order.”

Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys signed the contract on behalf of Nebraska.
The contract states Nebraska and ICE could agree to use the Work Ethic Camp this way for up to five years.
“Nebraska taxpayers are funding this prison, and the public has a right to know what’s happening inside,” Hunt said.
The prison is primarily designed to reduce Nebraska prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere.","LINCOLN — The State of Nebraska officially signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sept. 30 to convert the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention facility, officials announced Friday.

Under the initial two-year, 183-page contract, ICE plans to pay Nebraska at least $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees, adult males and females, at Nebraska’s Work Ethic Camp, which includes a daily bed rate of $269.17 per detainee. In the second year, minimum ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.

The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only male inmates.

Gov. Jim Pillen’s office said the contract would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.”

Projected cost savings

Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, which is largely Pillen’s main legislative lobbying arm, said in an email to state senators Friday that the arrangement is “designed to maximize fiscal benefit.”

“This new revenue model, when weighed against the current annual facility operating expense from general funds, demonstrates a significant financial advantage for the State of Nebraska,” Zoeller wrote.

Speaker the Nebraska Legislature John Arch of La Vista could not be immediately reached for comment.

Pillen’s office said the facility, which officials have said would be rebranded the “Cornhusker Clink,” will remain state-owned, and the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services will continue to run it.

Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys signed the contract on behalf of Nebraska. The contract states Nebraska and ICE could agree to use the Work Ethic Camp this way for up to five years.

Pillen’s office now estimates that the state could begin accepting detainees before November. Jeffreys has said he hopes the facility can be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement.

“I’m very grateful to President Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for their strong leadership in securing our nation’s southern border and addressing illegal immigration through initiatives like this,” Pillen said Friday in a statement.

Minors are not supposed to be housed at the repurposed prison. Any young people sent there must be relocated within 72 hours and be housed away from adults during that time, the contract states.

Reached Friday, State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said he hadn’t yet reviewed the contract but was pleased to hear one was signed. He said was still supportive of using those facilities “to enforce the law.”

“I just knew that we were going to cover all of our expenses, but I didn’t know we were going to make that much money,” Clements said. “I’m pleased to hear that.”

He said the extra funds could also help Nebraska’s budget situation and that “every little bit helps” as the state continues to face a projected budget deficit.

‘Public has a right to know’

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha blasted the contract Friday as “not just morally wrong, it’s unconstitutional” because of legislative checks and balances. She criticized provisions in the contract that ban videotaping, recording and public access to the state-owned facility, which would be contrary to how other state facilities operate.

“Nebraska taxpayers are funding this prison, and the public has a right to know what’s happening inside,” Hunt said. “When oversight is blocked, abuse thrives.”

State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha warned that ICE could withhold or deduct state payments for alleged noncompliance at the facility and that if detainees’ rights are violated, Nebraska taxpayers could be on the hook for any legal costs.

Hunt said that if ICE or state officials bar senators from conducting oversight, it would violate the separation of powers and obstruct lawmakers’ constitutional duties.

It wasn’t immediately clear why officials did not release the contract for 17 days after Jeffreys and an unnamed federal official signed it Sept. 30, hours before the ongoing federal shutdown. Pillen’s office and Jeffreys’ agency had denied multiple public records requests over that span, including one from the Examiner requesting a copy of the contract on Oct. 2.

Prison transition specifics

Attorney Jennifer Huxoll in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office told a Red Willow County District Court judge Thursday that she did not know when the facility would open but that all state inmates had been moved out. A Correctional Services spokesperson could not immediately answer Friday specifically where the inmates had been relocated.

Zoeller said all remaining state inmates were transferred to other facilities last week. There were 186 inmates at the facility on Aug. 19 when Pillen announced the plan.

Huxoll had also indicated Nebraska had entered multiple contracts, though she did not specify with whom. Jeffreys’ agency is currently contracting with a Lincoln-based fencing company for $750,000 to build a razor-wire fence around the Work Ethic Camp, which Huxoll said Thursday was 90% complete.

Zoeller said internal modifications will continue so Nebraska can house up to 300 detainees, up from about 200, and allow for virtual and in-person attorney visits and court proceedings. Providing additional housing and legal space will involve converting rehabilitative programming space. Zoeller said an intruder detection system had also been installed, and armed staff will constantly patrol the perimeter.

Staffing will increase from 97 full-time employees to 171. Zoeller said the new positions will provide coverage for repurposed spaces, housing units and transportation. Transportation will be reimbursed monthly at $10,816.67, with regular and overtime rates for on-call guards.

Minimum staffing levels required of the state under the contract have been redacted, as has information on handling emergency situations in receiving or discharging detainees.

“NDCS has developed staff training specific to the management of the detainee population and is exploring options to allow for the utilization of electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees,” Zoeller said.

Separation of powers lawsuit

State lawmakers created the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor. It opened four years later. The prison is primarily designed to reduce Nebraska prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere.

Thirteen McCook residents, plus a former state lawmaker, filed a lawsuit Wednesday to try to stop the transition and reopening of the Work Ethic Camp. They argue that because Pillen and Jeffreys did not receive legislative approval first, the transition of the facility violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.

13 McCook residents, former lawmaker sue to stop Nebraska-ICE detention center

Red Willow District Judge Patrick Heng will hear arguments next Friday on whether to grant a temporary injunction. He declined this week to block further action in the meantime.

State officials did not immediately answer whether they would begin to accept federal detainees before the temporary injunction motion could be heard. A temporary injunction would pause action until the lawsuit can be more holistically argued and evaluated.

In 1958, voters gave the Legislature authority over the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions. The latest lawsuit targets that constitutional provision as well as a state law that says state agencies can’t change or divert from the “use or purpose, kind or class” of public buildings in which lawmakers have appropriated tax dollars for.

Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

Nick Grandgenett, an attorney on behalf of the McCook residents, told District Judge Heng that state law also does not give Jeffreys’ agency the authority to house federal detainees.

“At its core, this is not about immigration,” Grandgenett said Thursday. “This is about our constitutional republican form of government.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0456-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 01:57:35.635380

According to the petition, ICE agents entered at least four separate courthouses across Chicago’s Cook County in September alone, including the Cook County Domestic Violence Courthouse.
In a statement, the Cook County Public Defender’s office said the order was urgently needed to ensure that courthouses remain accessible to the public regardless of immigration status.
Two state lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would codify the ban on civil arrests, including immigration arrests, at courthouses across the entire state of Illinois.
Vasquez’s office said she is one of two Cook County commissioners who authored a resolution asking other county agencies to alert the commissioners when ICE agents are seen inside county buildings or on public property.","As the Trump administration ratchets up its targeting of immigrant communities across the Chicagoland area, elected officials are looking for any tool they can find to protect their residents from militarized raids and roving bands of Border Patrol officers.

Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans banned civil arrests at county courthouses across Chicago this week, preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from arresting and attempting to deport people who show up to public courtrooms for matters unrelated to immigration.

The order went into effect on Tuesday and comes as federal judges and public officials in Illinois continue to push back against President Donald Trump and Operation Midway Blitz, ICE’s ongoing immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, after weeks of militarized chaos and violent arrests.

Immigration violations are a civil, not criminal, offense, despite the Trump administration’s repeated attempts to brand them that way. Under a policy established shortly after Trump took office that opened formerly protected areas such as schools and churches to immigration enforcement, ICE agents have arrived at Chicago area courthouses masked and unannounced to arrest people showing up for regular hearings, often without arrest warrants or uniforms clearly identifying them as ICE agents, according to Cook County Commissioner Jessica Vasquez.

Vasquez said local officials and advocates were particularly alarmed after ICE made an arrest in September outside a courthouse that hears cases filed by victims of domestic violence.

“Broadly across Cook County we have seen ICE agents target our courthouses for arrests, and these are individuals who are being compelled to come to court, they are coming to hearings they are mandated to go to,” Vasquez told Truthout in an interview. “Your government is asking you to come in for this, and then you are essentially being targeted by this federal agency for arrest.”

The ban on civil arrests at Cook County courts follows similar moves by judges and local officials inOregon,New York, New Jersey and beyond to limit ICE’s ability to arrest people in and around public courtrooms, including civil litigants and crime victims. Since Trump took office, ICE has targeted undocumented people who attempt to comply with everyday legal obligations — including immigration check-ins required of those seeking permanent legal residence in the United States.

Federal detention data and reports from Chicago and across the country suggest ICE is targeting anyone who is unable to produce documentation regardless of their criminal history or how long they have lived in the United States.

As part of Operation Midway Blitz, ICE agents have enraged and terrified residents with a series of militarized and highly performative immigration sweeps and raids across Chicago in recent weeks. Despite a well-documented drop in homicides and shootings recently, Trump has described Chicago as a crime-ridden “hellhole” and is pushing to deploy the National Guard against the wishes of city leaders and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

A federal judge on October 9 issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump’s National Guard deployment for two weeks. A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected the administration’s appeal and upheld the ruling.

More than a dozen lawyers, legal aid groups, and civil rights organizations petitioned Judge Evans for the ban on civil immigration arrests at county courthouses on October 1. According to the petition, ICE agents entered at least four separate courthouses across Chicago’s Cook County in September alone, including the Cook County Domestic Violence Courthouse.

“The reason we moved with such urgency was because we are also seeing how they are entering courthouses in New York City … they are masked, don’t have identification visible, and they come in and you don’t know what they are there for, essentially,” said Vasquez, who called Judge Evans to act on the petition.

In a statement, the Cook County Public Defender’s office said the order was urgently needed to ensure that courthouses remain accessible to the public regardless of immigration status. “No longer will federal immigration agents be permitted to use our court system as a way to target people who are complying with court orders or supporting loved ones,” the public defender’s office said.

Two state lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would codify the ban on civil arrests, including immigration arrests, at courthouses across the entire state of Illinois. Experts say states could also pass laws prohibiting staff at courthouses and state agencies from working directly with ICE.

Vasquez publicly called for the ban on civil arrests on October 3, the same day an ICE agent manhandled and handcuffed Chicago Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes while she was attempting to visit a constituent who was targeted by ICE while receiving treatment inside a hospital. The ICE agent reportedly threatened Fuentes with arrest before releasing her outside the hospital, and the alderwoman is reportedly preparing to file a lawsuit in response.

In a video of the incident, Fuentes can be seen asking plainclothed ICE agents for identification and a warrant before one of them grabs her, spins her around and puts her in handcuffs. Fuentes, who is Puerto Rican and represents a historically Latinx area of Chicago, told Block Club Chicago on Tuesday that the same ICE agent has apparently been seen in other raids in Chicago, and alleged that he was one of the agents caught on camera aggressively pushing a woman into a car in a Chicago neighborhood.

“Us documenting the atrocities, the constitutional violations and the violence that we are witnessing is what we need to do in this moment,” Fuentes said.

Vasquez’s office said she is one of two Cook County commissioners who authored a resolution asking other county agencies to alert the commissioners when ICE agents are seen inside county buildings or on public property. Those alerts go to volunteer community groups that respond to ICE operations in residential neighborhoods.

Vasquez said the Cook County Board is also looking for ways to prevent third party data brokers from mining county databases and contracts for personal information on residents and selling the data to ICE. The Trump administration is allowing ICE unprecedented access to personal information on millions of Americans held by the federal government, including health and tax records.

For example, Vasquez said private contractor LexisNexis manages data used by county criminal courts, and the company also has a lucrative $22 million data and surveillance contract with ICE that has so far avoided scrutiny from regulators. Critics say this gives ICE a “digital backdoor” to surveil people in the criminal legal system.

“We need to do everything we can to save as many people as we can as quickly as possible, and that means leaving no stone unturned,” Vasquez said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234389566-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:57:37.316365

Santa Cruz County sought clarity on releasing election and voting tally data

County denied request for ballot images and sued requester

Judges question impact on transparency, public access to records

A case poised to determine whether a county can sue a public records requester to obtain court-ordered clarity is pending at the Arizona Court of Appeals.

Under public records law, when someone requests a public record and is denied access, they have the authority to challenge the decision in court. If successful, they are entitled to recoup their legal costs.

But, when Santa Cruz County faced some uncertainty over whether to release an elections-related record, it decided to sue the organization requesting the record to get a final word from the court.

The Court of Appeals is now tasked with deciding whether Santa Cruz County does, in fact, have the authority to seek a declaratory action instead of becoming a defendant in a special action.

After the 2022 primary, Americans United for Democracy, Integrity and Transparency in Elections, also known as AUDIT USA, sent a public records request to Santa Cruz County for ballot images and the Cast Vote Record, or CVR, a dataset that anonymously shows each vote cast.

Santa Cruz County denied the request for ballot images due to a state law that shields access but initially agreed to transmit the CVR, along with some additional requests from the organization.

But on the day AUDIT USA expected the county to send the records, Santa Cruz County and its election director Alma Schultz changed course and filed a lawsuit in Pima County seeking a declaratory judgment on whether the CVR constituted a public record.

The county took the position that the CVR was protected by the same law shielding digital ballot images and sued first in anticipation of AUDIT USA doing the same.

AUDIT USA did not sue the county. But, Santa Cruz continued in its crusade for court clarification on the CVR and public records law.

Pima County Superior Court dismissed the lawsuit, denied reconsideration, and then rejected the claim a third time after the Arizona Court of Appeals remanded for further inquiry into whether a renewed request from AUDIT USA for the CVR could provide grounds for the suit.

The question is once again on appeal, with the Court of Appeals now considering whether a declaratory action is a reasonable course of action for a county to take when faced with a questionable public records decision.

In a draft decision issued before oral argument, the Arizona Court of Appeals again found the county did not have a justiciable controversy.

But the panel heard arguments Oct. 14 ahead of issuing a final ruling.

Justin Pierce, attorney for Santa Cruz, argued that counties are stuck “waiting to be sued” but noted the declaratory judgments act should allow a party to strike first if there is an actual case or controversy.

Judge Peter Eckerstrom pressed on how far a declaratory action statute can stretch.

“The declaratory action statute is certainly to be construed liberally, but it’s not to be construed to require a court to issue advisory opinions to every governmental entity that has to make a tough decision, right?” Eckerstrom said.

Pierce agreed, but said the county had public officials subject to liability in a “potential, but realistic cause of action.”

He said the case at hand is not a request for an advisory decision, but rather a situation where the county needs clarity given AUDIT USA’s history of litigation.

AUDIT USA’s website clarifies its aim at auditing ballot images and notes its work “often entails filing lawsuits against election officials who do not follow federal requirements to maintain election materials.”

But attorney for AUDIT USA Bill Risner countered the characterization of the organization as litigious and noted the organization had only sued once before in Maricopa County.

Risner argued the county never had a real conflict because the county never formally denied the request, leaving no controversy to litigate. He said there would not have been a difference if the county had decided to deny the records request and claimed that AUDIT USA never had any intention to sue Santa Cruz County over the denial.

Risner noted that litigation is not the only option available to the county, noting the ability to consult the secretary of sState or the attorney general.

As for the option to go to the attorney general for an advisory opinion, Pierce once again noted the need for some binding precedent.

“We believe we have the right to request a judicial determination on that to protect the county and to protect the county officials who are making decisions on these things in good faith,” Pierce said.

Eckerstrom was not convinced, noting that the current state law explicitly allows public records requestors to file a special action, not the other way around.

“You’re saying that we should rule, as a matter of law, that anytime someone files public records request that in your bag of options, it’s not to say yes or no, there’s a third option, file a lawsuit against them or a (declaratory judgment) action in a Superior Court, because we can’t decide whether to say yes or no,” Eckerstrom said.

He continued, “Doesn’t that impose at minimum attorney fee costs on people seeking public records? And wouldn’t that counter the public policy behind the public records law itself?”

And Eckerstrom pressed Pierce on the potential impact of attorneys’ fees.

“Couldn’t you chill people from filing public records requests if they don’t have deep pockets?” Eckerstrom asked.

Pierce argued it was appropriate for a county to pursue a judicial answer and said the parties sued could be named out of necessity, or enter an appearance if they decided not to defend the suit.

But Judge Sean Brearcliffe said that situation could give way to a county choosing a defendant who would be unable to put up a legal fight.

Pierce contended the courts could still serve as a safeguard in that scenario, and he again stressed the county has no path forward to get a judicial determination.

The disclosure of the CVR issue is still unclear, though, and Pierce noted that all the county has been asking for is to address the legality directly.

“Wouldn’t you get that if someone thought it was important enough to file a special action?” Judge Christopher Staring said.

Pierce said the county could, but it goes back to the central issue of the case, whether the county is compelled to wait for litigation.

“We believe the law is that we’re not. And that’s why we pursued this course. And we believe that the court should remand to the Superior Court to make a decision on this once and for all on the merits,” Pierce said.

Ken Bennett, chair for AUDIT USA and former lawmaker, said he, Risner and director John Brakey were “cautiously optimistic” given the draft ruling and the “tenor of (the judges’) questions today.”

A spokesperson for Santa Cruz County did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Counties typically deny or heavily redact requests for the CVR, fearing a violation of voter privacy by releasing data showing how people voted.

And, state law requires election officers to “ensure that electronic data from and electronic or digital images of ballots are protected from physical and electronic access, including unauthorized copying or transfer.”

Lawmakers have attempted to make the CVR a public record in the past, though none have been successful.

In the 2025 session, Sen. Mark Finchem introduced a CVR bill but hit a wall at the Governor’s Office.

“As secretary of state, I protected the right of every Arizonan to make their voice heard at the ballot box,” Gov. Katie Hobbs wrote in her veto letter. “This bill would place constitutionally protected voter privacy at risk.”",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2024/03/Judge-gavel-justice-court.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:57:57.280592

Ro Khanna pushes resolution calling for ICE, CBP reforms amid ...",Not Available,,,,,https://khanna.house.gov/media/in-the-news/democratic-rep-ro-khanna-pushes-resolution-calling-ice-cbp-reforms-amid,"""This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,"" Khanna told CBS News.
""We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.""
House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has ""not seen them cross the line yet.""
""I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,"" he said.
""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats.","Washington — Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as ""lawless"" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.

The resolution(link is external), cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.

""This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,"" Khanna told CBS News. ""We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.""

The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included(link is external) roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.

Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz(link is external), a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.

On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas(link is external) during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers(link is external) operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was ""a little startled"" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. ""I live in Chicago,"" Ellis said. ""And I'm not blind.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has ""not seen them cross the line yet."" Johnson told reporters that ""ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,"" adding that Republicans ""stand for law enforcement.""

Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles ""fuels impersonation of immigration officers"" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who ""understand the importance of not having government overreach.""

On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. ""CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers ""are authorized to defend themselves and others"" and that DHS ""reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.""

The department has said assaults against ICE agents have risen more than 1,000% this year, though it has not released data supporting that figure.

Khanna said his resolution aims to restore public confidence while ensuring officer safety.

""I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,"" he said. ""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats. This will make sure that Americans' constitutional rights are protected and the constitutional rights of immigrants are protected.""",https://khanna.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-18 06:57:04.510519

“The Providence FOP, Lodge #3 strongly objects to the ordinance amendments which have been proposed to the 'Community-Police Relations Act' dealing with Providence police officers' interactions with federal immigration law enforcement officers' actions within the City. The idea that our police officers should not and would not be able to respond to an emergency situation if federal law enforcement officials request or need our assistance for safety-related concerns is dangerous and absurd. This is a borderline violation of our oath as police officers and an obstruction of the duties we have been sworn to perform,"" wrote the FOP.

But while the FOP criticized, Mayor Brett Smiley strongly supported the Council’s actions.

“In the wake of the Trump Administration’s continued cruel actions, I am doing everything in my power to protect Providence’s immigrant community and I applaud the work to prioritize and update the Community Relations Act. I am thankful to have worked collaboratively with Council leadership on changes to their proposed amendments that align with my executive order and remove language that would have made the City and our taxpayers vulnerable to unnecessary lawsuits,” said Smiley.

“These changes will help to protect our City from dangerous financial liabilities, continue to protect our immigrant communities, and support our officers to continue their nationally recognized community policing practices,” Smiley added.

The amendments now require one more passage by the full council, with a vote scheduled for November 6. The council also passed a resolution relative to virtual court hearings.

“In Providence, we take pride in being a welcoming city where every neighbor deserves to feel safe,” said Councilor Miguel Sanchez (Ward 6), the prime sponsor of the amendments. “Across the country, we’ve seen federal immigration agents bring chaos and trauma into local communities. These amendments make clear that here in Providence, our police will not be part of that harm. Our immigrant neighbors are the backbone of this city, and they deserve safety, dignity, and accountability.”

But, the FOP says the ordinance is an overreach.

“Also, the concept that our police officers could face legal consequences (civil or otherwise) for performing their sworn duties is unlawful and disgraceful. Restricting police officers in a way that doesn't allow them to respond properly to potentially dangerous situations without fear of unfair repercussions puts the safety of all members of the public in jeopardy, as a situation could escalate to a point of lost control. Federal law enforcement officers are required to and will respond to threats and force with force of their own, when necessary, but if our police officers have a presence at a volatile scene, then the potential of violence can be deterred,” said the FOP letter signed by President Michael Imondi.

“One not need look any further than to what occurred this past weekend in Chicago, where Chicago police officers were ordered to refrain in a timely manner from attending to a violent and out-of-control scene where federal law enforcement officials were under attack, to see the results of this foolhardy concept,” added Imondi.

The Council office claims the changes are as follows:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not normally tasked with immigration who have recently been deputized by the Trump administration in order to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and National Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as those directives are accompanied by a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant. The proposed CPRA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CPRA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces allows families, and especially youth, to have more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and more specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all of the restrictions set forth in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow certain types of non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CPRA violations by Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

A two-count indictment returned Thursday evening by a federal grand jury in Des Moines charges Ian Roberts with one count of making a false statement for employment and one count of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.

Roberts, who is originally from Guyana and worked for two decades in school districts across the country, was detained September 26 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a targeted operation.

Authorities said Roberts fled from agents in his district-issued Jeep Cherokee before being found in a wooded area. Roberts had a handgun wrapped in a towel inside the car, investigators said.

Des Moines Public Schools hired Roberts in 2023 to lead its district of about 30,000 students.

The indictment alleges that he made a “false attestation” on a US Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, claiming he was a US citizen when he knew he was not.

Roberts’ attorney, Alfredo Parrish, didn’t immediately return a phone message.

Federal authorities said an immigration judge issued a final removal order last year, and an appeal to reopen immigration proceedings was rejected earlier this year.

After his detention by ICE, Roberts was transferred to federal custody October 2 on an arrest warrant and charged with unlawfully possessing firearms while being in the US illegally. In addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, three other weapons were found during a search of Roberts’ home, authorities said.

Operation Patriot 2.0, as the agency called it, was run from September 4th to 30th. It said more than 1,461 people were taken into custody in the first Operation Patriot in the state, back in May.

From a total of 1,406 undocumented people detained in Massachusetts last month, more than 600 had ""significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives,"" ICE said in a statement released on Thursday.

""Six of those arrested were documented members of transnational criminal gangs while several others were gang associates,"" the statement said. ""Three of those arrested were known or suspected terrorists.""

ICE arrests in Massachusetts

Among those arrested, according to ICE, were 24-year-old Anderson Stephen Hernandez-Vasquez of Guatemala, who served two years in prison in Woburn for child rape.

Mario Augusto Lopes-Barros, a 42-year-old citizen of Cape Verde, who served time for voluntary manslaughter in Bristol County, and 29-year-old Welington Aristy of the Dominican Republic, who was wanted for possession of fentanyl and other drugs in Massachusetts, were also detained, ICE said.

However, WBZ-TV found that at least some of those arrested in Massachusetts in September had no record of having committed violent or other crimes.

They include Jhon Palacio-Morales of Lowell, who was wrongfully arrested outside his home on September 8, according to his partner. His family said he has no criminal history and was legally allowed to enter the U.S. from Columbia in 2022. But ICE said Palacio-Morales ""is an illegal alien"" who ""unlawfully entered the United States.""

Edgar Hernan Elias Escobar, who was taken into custody on September 17 in Malden, also has no criminal record, according to his attorney, who added that his client has a pending petition to become a permanent U.S. resident. Escobar's family said Friday afternoon he was released on bond on October 11.

WBZ has reached out to ICE's Boston office for comment on both cases but has not heard back yet.

In another case, involving a 16-year-old ICE took into custody in Milford on September 12, the agency later acknowledged that it didn't know his age and ultimately drove the teen back home and released him.

WBZ has also reached out to Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for comments on ICE's announcement. Both have been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

The ERISA Litigation Update will gather notable developments in this space, including important court decisions and appeals as well as regulatory guidance, and provide information regarding those developments on a quarterly basis.

1 Second Circuit Affirms Dismissal of Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims for Lack of Article III Standing

Key Takeaway: On a matter of first impression, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of breach of fiduciary duty claims because the named plaintiffs failed to sufficiently plead that they suffered injury-in-fact.

On August 18, 2025, in Collins v. Northeast Grocery, Inc., No. 24-2339, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals largely affirmed dismissal of a complaint brought by participants in the Northeast Grocery 401(k) plan. The plaintiffs challenged (i) recordkeeping and advisory fees and (ii) the selection and retention of certain plan investment options, including funds they claimed underperformed or used higher-cost share classes when lower-cost share classes were available. The District Court for the Northern District of New York had dismissed the complaint without leave to amend, in part because the plaintiffs had not invested in any of the investment funds they challenged and, thus, failed to plead injury-in-fact.

On appeal, the Second Circuit addressed for the first time whether plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the selection or monitoring of 401(k) plan funds that they did not invest in. The Second Circuit squarely rejected the plaintiffs’ standing theory that allegations of plan-wide mismanagement are sufficient to demonstrate injury-in-fact. The Second Circuit held that such allegations were conclusory and speculative; rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate that they were affected in a personal and individual way. For this reason, the court held that the plaintiffs lacked constitutional standing and failed to satisfy the class standing test as to their claims concerning funds that they did not invest in. In a separate summary order, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of the remaining breach of fiduciary duty claims for failure to plead a meaningful benchmark. However, the court reversed and remanded one prohibited transaction claim in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Cunningham v. Cornell University.

2 Ninth Circuit Clarifies Law Regarding Whether Plan Language Can Require Arbitration

Key Takeaway: The Ninth Circuit affirms in part and reverses in part a district court’s decision denying motion to compel arbitration.

On August 4, 2025, in Platt v. Sodexo, S.A., No. 23-55737, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court for the Central District of California’s decision denying the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in a case concerning challenges to monthly tobacco surcharges on health insurance plan premiums. In so doing, the Ninth Circuit drew a distinction between moving to compel arbitration of claims brought by an individual plan participant (under ERISA Sections 502(a)(1)(B) & (a)(3)) and moving to compel arbitration of claims brought by a participant on behalf of the plan (under Section 502(a)(2)).

With respect to the claims brought by the plaintiff as an individual plan participant, the Ninth Circuit held that the plan’s arbitration clause was unenforceable as to this plaintiff because it was added to the plan after the plaintiff joined the plan. The court held that, to be bound by the arbitration clause, the plaintiff must consent to it, which the plaintiff did not do. The court noted that, although explicit consent is unnecessary, the plaintiff lacked sufficient notice of the addition of the arbitration clause or that he would be subject to it by virtue of his continued participation in the plan.

With respect to the claims brought on behalf of the plan, the court concluded that the consent of an individual plan participant to arbitrate is not needed; the participant’s unilateral consent to the plan is sufficient consent to the arbitration clause. However, the plan’s arbitration clause also included a class action waiver, which the Ninth Circuit found impermissibly restricts the right of plan participants under ERISA to bring a class action. The court remanded to the district court to determine whether the class action waiver was severable (i.e., whether the arbitration clause permitted the class action waiver to be removed in the event that a court determines that the waiver impermissibly restricts the rights of plan participants). If so, the arbitration clause could still be enforceable. The Ninth Circuit also remanded the case to the district court for it to determine whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable.

3 Defendant Prevails at Trial on Recordkeeping and Share Class Claims

Key Takeaway: The court found that the defendant had prudently monitored a 401(k) plan’s recordkeeping costs and the share classes of its investments.

On August 12, 2025, in McDonald v. Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, No. 22-680, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina entered a full defense judgment for defendant Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) in litigation regarding its 401(k) plan. LabCorp’s motion to dismiss had narrowed the claims, leaving only two surviving claims: the defendant had breached its duty of prudence by failing to monitor the plan’s recordkeeping costs by failing to investigate the availability of lower-cost share classes for its investment options. On Daubert motions, the court had excluded opinions from one of the plaintiffs’ experts regarding what would constitute a reasonable recordkeeping fee for the LabCorp plan but otherwise declined to exclude the experts’ opinions. A bench trial was held from May 5, 2025, through May 8, 2025.

The court entered a judgment for LabCorp on all claims. The court first found that, while it had not excluded most opinions from plaintiff’s experts, it found those experts opinions to be unpersuasive because the experts either testified solely based on their own experience and not industry standards or started with their ultimate conclusion and then found evidence to support it. Next, the court found that LabCorp had prudently monitored the plan’s recordkeeping costs, including through the use of an independent consultant and multiple requests for information or fee benchmarking analyses. Finally, the court also ruled in favor of LabCorp on the share class claim, finding that there was no evidence that LabCorp either met the minimum asset requirement for lower-cost investments or that this requirement would be waived for the plan.

4 Recent Developments in Forfeiture Cases

Key Takeaway: District courts have continued to weigh in on forfeiture claims and have dismissed many such claims. Several forfeiture cases are now before appellate courts and, in one, the Department of Labor has submitted an amicus brief in support of the defendants.

Key developments in forfeiture cases over the past quarter include:

Courts Continue to Grant Motions to Dismiss Claims Challenging Allocation of Forfeitures

District courts have continued the growing trend toward the dismissal of claims that challenge employers’ allocation of forfeitures to reduce employer contributions. In several of these decisions, courts have dismissed forfeiture claims under Rule 12(b)(6) based on the reasoning in Hutchins v. HP — that the plaintiff’s theory is overbroad because it allows for no set of circumstances or context in which a prudent and loyal fiduciary could apply forfeited amounts toward employer contributions. In other decisions, courts have dismissed forfeiture claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of Article III standing. In those cases, the courts held that the plaintiffs could not have suffered an injury-in-fact because the plans did not authorize the defendants to use forfeited amounts in the way the plaintiffs claimed they should have been used.

A Small Number of Courts Have Denied Motions to Dismiss Forfeiture Claims

By contrast, a handful of district courts have bucked the trend toward dismissal and allowed forfeiture claims to proceed to discovery. For example, in Buescher v. North American Lighting, Inc., the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois denied a motion to dismiss where the complaint specifically alleged that there were circumstances in which the decision to offset employer contributions could align with the interests of participants. The court held that the defendants were required to base their decision regarding how to use forfeited amounts on an adequate investigation.

Department of Labor Weighs In on Forfeiture Litigation in Favor of Employers

On July 9, 2025, the Department of Labor (DOL) filed an amicus brief in support of the defendants in the Hutchins v. HP appeal currently pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The DOL explained its view that the fundamental issue with the plaintiff’s theory of liability was that the plaintiff ignored the constraints on the fiduciary’s decision-making evident from the face of the complaint and the plan terms. For example, there was a possibility that there would be a funding shortfall if the plan sponsor refused to increase its contributions to make up for amounts that would be covered by forfeitures. This is the first public position the DOL has taken on the recent wave of forfeiture litigation.

Appeals of Forfeiture Decisions Granting Motions to Dismiss Continue

In addition to the Hutchins v. HP appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, several plaintiffs have appealed district court decisions granting motions to dismiss in the Ninth, Eighth, and Third Circuit Courts of Appeal. The forfeiture cases currently on appeal include:

Hutchins v. HP Inc., No. 25-826 (9th Cir. Feb. 7, 2025)

Sievert v. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc., No. 25-3409 (9th Cir. May 28, 2025)

Wright v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 25-4235 (9th Cir. July 9, 2025)

Matula v. Wells Fargo & Co., No. 25-2441 (8th Cir. July 17, 2025)

McWashington v. Nordstrom, Inc., No. 25-04613 (9th Cir. July 18, 2025)

Cain v. Siemens Corp., No. 25-2564 (3d Cir. Aug. 19, 2025)

Barragan v. Honeywell International, Inc., No. 25-2609 (3d Cir. Aug. 22, 2025)

The HP case is fully briefed; the briefing for the other appeals is expected to be completed by later 2025 or early 2026.

The demonstrations oppose authoritarian behavior by President Donald Trump’s administration, including a targeted campaign against the media, the investigations of his political foes, the use of the military on U.S. soil and the lack of due process for many immigrants swept up in his nationwide deportation campaign.

The rallies will take place in more than 100 cities, including Santa Cruz, Watsonville and Salinas, where local Indivisible chapters are leading the organizing charge.

Indivisible is a national progressive movement that coordinates thousands of local, grassroots groups focused on uplifting policies that reflect a strong commitment to democracy and demanding transparency from elected officials. Since Trump took office for a second term, Indivisible has concentrated most of their efforts on organizing local and national events to voice discontent over his growing authoritarian agenda.

The goal is to draw attention to community-wide concerns about preserving democracy, immigration and deportations and other civil rights issues, organizers said. Leaders have said a core principle behind the “No Kings” movement is a commitment to peaceful, nonviolent action.

Peggy Flynn, co-president of the Democratic Women’s Club of Santa Cruz County, said that despite the challenges brought by the current administration, many local residents’ commitment to defending democratic principles remains firm.

“We’re not going to be intimidated” by the Trump administration’s actions, said Flynn, whose organization is helping to promote the local rallies. “We’re the ones who love our country and want our democracy to continue intact.”

Flynn said she hopes for strong turnout locally.

“It’s important to be counted. It’s important to be present,” she said.

An estimated 10,000 people participated in the June “No Kings” protest in Santa Cruz, and organizers are expecting a similar turnout on Saturday.

Vought said on social media the US army corps of engineers would pause work on “low priority” projects in cities such as New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore. He said the projects could eventually be canceled.

The White House office of management and budget (OMB) said Donald Trump “wants to reorient how the federal government prioritizes Army Corps projects”.

The Trump administration has already frozen at least $28bn meant for transportation and energy projects in Democratic-controlled cities and states, as the president pressures his opponents in Congress to end the shutdown, which began on 1 October.

Trump has also vowed to cut “Democrat agencies” and has sought to eliminate 4,100 federal jobs as he looks to inflict pain on his political opposition.

The army corps of engineers projects include a waterfront park in San Francisco, bridge expansions in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and water and wastewater systems in New York City, the OMB said. New York projects account for $7bn of the total.

Other affected projects are in Illinois, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Delaware, the OMB said.

All of these states voted against Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

Reuters first reported DHS’ plans to keep paying frontline federal law enforcement personnel.
But even with these extraordinary measures in place, many employees at national security and law enforcement agencies will apparently keep working without pay until the shutdown ends.
Many federal employees received their first partial paycheck last Friday, and are set to miss their first full paycheck later this month.
“We got the people that we want paid, paid,” President Donald Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.","The Trump administration is doubling down on its plans to keep paying some frontline federal law enforcement employees during the government shutdown, while many civilian government workers risk missing their first full paycheck next week.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X on Thursday afternoon that more than 70,000 federal law enforcement officials — including employees from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Secret Service, as well as federal air marshals and other “critical mission areas” will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown.

Noem wrote that these federal law enforcement employees will receive a “super check” by Oct. 22 that covers shutdown days already worked without pay, their overtime and their next pay period.

“President Trump and I will always stand by law enforcement, and we are keeping our promise to always support them by making sure they are paid during the Democrats’ shutdown,” Noem said.

A DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will ensure that these 70,000 employees “will be having their pay covered during the Democrats’ government shutdown.”

The spokesperson said CBP border patrol agents, ICE deportation officers, Secret Service special agents and Transportation Security Administration air marshals are specifically covered by this announcement.

The budget reconciliation bill, which was signed into law this summer, gave DHS additional funds and few conditions on how to spend that money.

Reuters first reported DHS’ plans to keep paying frontline federal law enforcement personnel.

But even with these extraordinary measures in place, many employees at national security and law enforcement agencies will apparently keep working without pay until the shutdown ends.

The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CBP customs employees, said CBP officers will continue to be paid during the shutdown, but other agency employees won’t be paid on time.

“This is welcome news for these law enforcement officers who staff our nation’s 328 ports of entry and have worked without interruption during this shutdown,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement. “However, this decision does not apply to other CBP employees who also do vital work facilitating international trade and travel and other federal employees who work every day to serve the American people.”

DHS is moving money around to pay federal air marshals working for TSA, but a TSA spokesperson said in a statement that TSA officers are not covered under Noem’s announcement, “as they are not law enforcement officers.”

Geddes Scott, president of the American Federation of Government Employees NY/NJ VA Council 246 and a retired Department of Veterans Affairs nurse, said many of the veterans showing up for VA healthcare appointments work as federal law enforcement officials, and are concerned about missed paychecks.

“A lot of the veterans we take care of work at these different agencies, whether it’s DHS, Border Patrol, Bureau of Prisons or TSA. When they’re not getting paid, it affects their mental health,” Scott said. “When they show up to my facility … you can see the mental toll it takes on those individuals.”

Scott said he recently spoke with two Bureau of Prisons employees, both of them veterans, who raised concerns about not being paid on time during the lapse. One just had a baby, the other recently bought a car.

“You see the life in them is being sucked out, because of this political fight that’s going on, that they didn’t sign on for,” he said.

The Trump administration is not going to these lengths to keep civilian federal employees working during the shutdown from missing a paycheck.

Many federal employees received their first partial paycheck last Friday, and are set to miss their first full paycheck later this month.

“We got the people that we want paid, paid,” President Donald Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.

The Defense Department started the trend this week by repurposing $6.5 billion in unspent research and development funds to keep active-duty service members from missing a paycheck on Wednesday.

But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) told reporters on Friday that the same ad-hoc process won’t be an option to cover their next paycheck, if the shutdown continues.

“I do want you to know that that option is not going to be available in two weeks for their next paycheck,” Rogers said. “We have 2 million service members that were able to get paid this week because of President Trump’s creativity. These are families that are serving around the world. Many of them in very unfavorable conditions, making huge sacrifices for our freedom and safety, and most of them live paycheck-to-paycheck.”

Rogers said that 500,000 civilian federal employees will miss their first full paycheck next week, “and then the rest of them the week thereafter.”

“This is going to get really painful for a lot of civilian employees. Obviously, I think about the DoD civilian employees. But throughout the federal workforce, people will start missing their first paycheck next week and the week after,” Rodgers said.

On Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel told reporters at the White House that the Trump administration had taken steps to ensure that the bureau’s more than 13,000 special agents will be paid during the shutdown.

However, other FBI and Justice Department employees — including attorneys representing the Trump administration in federal court — continue to work without pay.

Meanwhile, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said federal courts, starting Oct. 20, “will no longer have funding to sustain full, paid operations.”

“Until the ongoing lapse in government funding is resolved, federal courts will maintain limited operations necessary to perform the Judiciary’s constitutional functions,” the office said in a statement Friday.

Federal judges will continue to work, but court staff may only perform certain excepted activities during the remainder of the shutdown.

“Each appellate, district, and bankruptcy court will make operational decisions regarding how its cases and probation and pretrial supervision will be conducted during the funding lapse,” the notice states.

The rulings in Illinois followed similar decisions from federal district judges in California and Oregon blocking deployments in those states.
The judges said Trump had made false claims of uncontrolled violence and infringed on states’ power to manage their own law enforcement challenges.
But courts have not ruled uniformly against Trump’s use of the National Guard.
In June, the administration won orders from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing deployments in Los Angeles to continue.","In response to the appeal, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said on X: “Donald Trump will keep trying to invade Illinois with troops — and we will keep defending the sovereignty of our state. Militarizing our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy.”

The appeal marks the first time the high court will consider Trump’s efforts to federalize state-run National Guard troops and deploy them into states led by Democratic governors who have opposed the extraordinary moves. It comes one day after a federal appeals court panel voted, 3-0, to leave in place the Chicago-based district judge’s restraining order that prevents Trump from putting the guard troops on the streets in Illinois.

“Political opposition is not rebellion,” the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel wrote, rejecting the Trump administration’s argument that immigration-related protests amounted to the sort of extreme threat to government authority that is needed for the president to have authority under federal law to deploy the guard.

The rulings in Illinois followed similar decisions from federal district judges in California and Oregon blocking deployments in those states. The judges said Trump had made false claims of uncontrolled violence and infringed on states’ power to manage their own law enforcement challenges.

One of the judges — a Trump appointee in Oregon — concluded earlier this month that Trump’s basis for federalizing Oregon troops to deploy them in Portland was “untethered” from reality and warned the effort risked normalizing the use of military troops against Americans in ways the founders had warned against.

But courts have not ruled uniformly against Trump’s use of the National Guard. In June, the administration won orders from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing deployments in Los Angeles to continue.

The Oregon judge’s ruling is also currently on appeal at the 9th Circuit. When a panel of that court heard arguments last week, a majority of the judges seemed inclined to allow the troops to be put on the street.

In addition to the Chicago area, Portland and Los Angeles, Trump has ordered the military into Memphis, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., citing claims of uncontrolled violent crime that local officials have sharply rejected.

The deployments have inflamed tensions with Democratic governors and city leaders, who say the presence of troops has stoked, rather than calmed, civil unrest.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F49%2Ff7%2F44e81e864c6a93b5a2665c4bcefd%2Faptopix-national-guard-cities-chicago-61631.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:02:55.618842

texted Mr. Stanton that he wanted to speak with him about his various posts on TikTok, the authorities said.","A Wisconsin man has been charged with making threats toward federal law enforcement officers in a series of TikTok videos in which he promoted the killing of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

The man, Andrew Stanton, 38, of Kenosha, Wis., pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee on Thursday, one day after he was indicted on three criminal counts that carry a combined maximum of 20 years in prison.

The charges include threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a U.S. official; sending threatening communications across state lines; and stalking, according to court records.

Mr. Stanton was arrested on Oct. 8, four days after saying in a TikTok video that ICE agents conducting immigration roundups for the Trump administration should be targeted, the authorities said.

“It’s time we start shooting at you,” a criminal complaint quoted Mr. Stanton as saying.

In a statement, John Bradley, a lawyer for Mr. Stanton, a Marine Corps veteran who served in the Iraq War, said: “It is important to remember that the contents of a criminal complaint represent one side of the story and are just allegations. Mr. Stanton pled not guilty. He is presumed innocent, and we will vigorously defend against these charges in court.”

Federal investigators said that they began monitoring Mr. Stanton’s social media posts in late August, citing a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, a federal office that tracks suspected terrorist activity.

At the time, a TikTok account registered to Mr. Stanton asked for whereabouts of any Israel Defense Forces members in the Illinois or Wisconsin area, a special agent for the F.B.I. wrote in the criminal complaint.

In another TikTok video posted in late August, Mr. Stanton said that words were not bringing about change from politicians, the authorities said.

“You have to use bullets,” he was quoted as saying in the complaint.

Investigators said Mr. Stanton recorded a separate video that same day in which he endorsed terrorism and the text onscreen read, “I think we should be OFFING federal agents.”

According to the F.B.I., law enforcement officers tried to interview Mr. Stanton twice in early September and were unable to reach him.

But he did not go dark on social media.

When a gunman fatally shot Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder and a right-wing ally of President Trump, while he was speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, Mr. Stanton resurfaced online, the authorities said.

“Long day for me, and I’m not necessarily out here to be eloquent,” Mr. Stanton said in a video that day, according to the complaint. “I just want to say one thing. Do more Charlie Kirks. Do a lot more Charlie Kirks.”

On Sept. 11, a supervisor with U.S. Customs and Border Protection who was assigned with the F.B.I. texted Mr. Stanton that he wanted to speak with him about his various posts on TikTok, the authorities said.

After initially using an obscenity to tell the investigator off, Mr. Stanton sent him a series of threatening text messages, according to the complaint, telling him “Kill yourself fed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16xp-tiktokthreats-cpkb/16xp-tiktokthreats-cpkb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 18:57:56.780415

The request came a day after a three-judge panel for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals partially upheld a federal district court order halting Trump’s military intervention in the Windy City.

12406 (Title 10), an archaic law Trump has repeatedly used to federalize state national guard troops and deploy them into major Democratic-led cities across the country.","President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court Friday to stay a lower court order barring his attempted military deployment in Chicago.

The stay application marks the first time that a block to Trump’s troop deployments around the country has reached the Supreme Court.

The request came a day after a three-judge panel for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals partially upheld a federal district court order halting Trump’s military intervention in the Windy City.

The appeals court ruling was a major win for Illinois and Chicago, both of which sued earlier this month arguing that the deployment infringes on the state’s sovereignty and its right to self-governance. It also marked the first time an appeals court officially blocked one of Trump’s National Guard deployments in a major U.S. city.

In its application, Solicitor General D. John Sauer claimed that both the district court and the Seventh Circuit erred in questioning Trump’s authority to deploy troops domestically.

“Both courts were mistaken to conclude that a federal court may review the President’s judgment at all,” Sauer argued.

“Even if the President’s determination to call up the Illinois National Guard were subject to review at all, the government is likely to succeed in showing on appeal that the President acted well within the authority vested in him by Section 12406’s provisions,” the solicitor general added.

Sauer was referring to 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), an archaic law Trump has repeatedly used to federalize state national guard troops and deploy them into major Democratic-led cities across the country.

The rarely used statute allows the president to federalize state Guard troops when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or when the president is unable to execute laws with regular resources.

After threatening to send troops into Chicago for months, Trump last week used the statute to federalize Illinois and Texas Guard troops and deployed them into the city over the repeated objections of local and state officials.

The Trump administration claimed the troops were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies, who it claimed have been unable to carry out immigration arrests due to a “rebellion” in the city.

Chicago residents in recent weeks have staged largely peaceful protests against the Department of Homeland Security’s aggressive and escalatory immigration raids throughout the city.

However, U.S. District Court Judge April Perry, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, quickly halted the federalization and deployment after finding the Trump administration’s account of recent protests unreliable. Perry said that recent protests could not constitute a rebellion.

The Seventh Circuit Thursday evening partially stayed Perry’s order by upholding the federalization of Illinois and Texas Guard members but barring Trump from deploying them anywhere in Illinois.

The appeals court panel, which was made up of judges appointed by Trump, former President Barack Obama and former President George H. W. Bush, agreed with Perry’s assessment that recent unrest did not amount to a rebellion.

“Political opposition is not rebellion,” the panel wrote.

“We conclude that the district court’s factual findings at this preliminary stage were not clearly erroneous, and that the facts do not justify the President’s actions in Illinois,” it added.

In the stay application to the Supreme Court, Sauer not only claimed that the protests were a rebellion but likened them to the Whiskey Rebellion, the 1794 armed uprising of farmers and distillers during the presidency of George Washington.

Illinois and local officials have warned that the Trump administration has deliberately used aggressive immigration raids and escalatory tactics to provoke unrest in the city and create a pretext to deploy troops in Chicago.

Residents have documented instances of federal agents grabbing people by the throat, releasing tear gas on busy residential streets and arresting local elected officials.

In a court hearing last week, Department of Justice attorneys did not disagree with Perry’s assessment that the government could deliberately foment unrest in a city and cite that unrest in deploying troops.

Several of the other plaintiffs are women who survived domestic violence or are crime victims, then applied for T or U visas, and were granted the ""deferred action"" status.
Her attorney informed ICE of her deferred action status, but officers deported her a day later, the suit said.
A 43-year-old woman, Kenia J. Merlos, of Honduras, is also legally in the U.S. under the deferred action status, the complaint said.
They asked the federal government to revert to its previous policies that would shield immigrant crime victims from deportation.","A new lawsuit from immigrant advocates argues that the federal government is illegally detaining and deporting crime victims who should have been protected from deportation.

Among the plaintiffs is Yessenia Ruano, the former Milwaukee Public Schools teacher's aide who publicly fought her deportation but eventually was forced by immigration officers to return to El Salvador with her twin U.S. citizen daughters.

The federal lawsuit, filed in the Central District of California Oct. 14, identifies several immigrants nationwide who had applied for trafficking and crime victims' visas, known as T and U visas, but were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawsuit targets policy changes by President Donald Trump's administration that it alleges are running contrary to laws ""that Congress created specifically to protect them from deportation,"" the suit said.

Named as defendants are Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — ICE — which handles deportations, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, which handles legal immigration pathways.

The lawsuit focuses on immigrants with two kinds of statuses: crime victims who were granted a ""deferred action"" status, meaning they are allowed to legally stay in the U.S. for a period of time; and victims who have pending T or U visa applications.

Before Trump took office, people with pending T and U visas could generally remain in the country while they waited for a decision in their cases. ICE told Ruano she must self-deport instead of waiting for a decision in her case from USCIS, the agency that would issue that visa.

The lawsuit argues that ICE was required by law to ask its counterpart, USCIS, if Ruano's T visa case had enough evidence to support it. If it had been found to meet initial requirements, ICE would've been legally required not to deport her. ICE did not seek that determination in Ruano's case, the lawsuit said.

Several of the other plaintiffs are women who survived domestic violence or are crime victims, then applied for T or U visas, and were granted the ""deferred action"" status. Despite that, the lawsuit said, the women were detained by immigration agents.

Among them is a 64-year-old Los Angeles woman identified in the complaint with a pseudonym who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years and has four U.S. citizen children and three grandchildren. The suit said the woman was arrested outside her home by ICE in April for a 1998 deportation order. Her attorney informed ICE of her deferred action status, but officers deported her a day later, the suit said.

Also included in the lawsuit is a 46-year-old vendor of tamales in Los Angeles who was beaten at a bus stop in 2021 and had received a deferred action status. She was detained as part of ICE raids in her city and was released on bond, but is required to give ICE her location weekly, the complaint said.

A 43-year-old woman, Kenia J. Merlos, of Honduras, is also legally in the U.S. under the deferred action status, the complaint said. While she was visiting Canadian relatives at a park in Washington state, border agents approached the family and detained her, her 71-year-old mother, her four children — a 7 year old and 9-year-old triplets — and the Canadian relatives. All were later released except Merlos, who remains in ICE custody, the lawsuit said.

The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit with several California-based immigrant advocacy groups, including the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, and the Immigration Center for Women and Children.

They asked the federal government to revert to its previous policies that would shield immigrant crime victims from deportation. And they asked the court to issue an order returning the plaintiffs to their previous position. If the suit is successful on that front, it could mean Ruano would be able to return to the U.S.

The policies replace ""the long-standing and judiciously crafted 'victim-centered' approach with an unforgiving, arbitrary and unlawful 'deportation-centered' system that ignores crime victims' eligibility for relief and railroads them into detention and removal without due process,"" the complaint said.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/PMJS/86748504007-mjs-250530-local-mjsdeporthearingp-1.jpg?crop=5947,3347,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-17 20:02:59.932359

Broadview ICE protests

What we know:

The protests follow a federal judge’s order earlier this week requiring the removal of a fence that had been erected around the facility’s entrance on Beach Street. The same court also set new parameters on how federal agents may operate in the area.

Demonstrations were scheduled to begin around 9 a.m., and it was unclear whether protesters would attempt to move closer to the facility now that the barrier has been taken down. Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office were expected to be on standby during the protest.

Illinois State Police said some protesters blocked a street outside the facility and ignored requests to move to the designated protest area.

Kat Abughazaleh, a protester and congressional candidate, expressed outrage.

""A free speech zone implies that everywhere else is not a free speech zone,"" she said.

Abughazaleh said she was hit in the face with a baton Friday and saw a woman pushed to the ground by officers.

The renewed attention on the Broadview site comes as federal courts weigh the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago. A federal appeals panel ruled Thursday that the administration cannot send troops to the city, upholding an earlier order blocking the move.

Gov. JB Pritzker, who sued to stop the deployment, called the attempt ""unlawful and unconstitutional,"" saying there is no rebellion or insurrection taking place in Chicago.

Texas National Guard troops were seen outside the Broadview ICE facility late last week but have not returned since. Local officials say they will continue monitoring the situation as Friday’s demonstrations unfold.

Federal immigration agents ordered to wear body cameras

A judge on Thursday ordered federal immigration officers in the Chicago area to wear body cameras and also summoned a senior official to court next week to discuss an enforcement operation that has resulted in more than 1,000 arrests.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said she was a ""little startled"" after seeing TV images of street confrontations that involved tear gas and other tactics during President Donald Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdown in the nation’s third-largest city.

""I am adding that all agents who are operating in Operation Midway Blitz are to wear body-worn cameras, and they are to be on,"" Ellis said, referring to the government’s name for the crackdown.

She said cameras would provide evidence to back up how agents handle confrontations with protesters.

""Worst of the worst""

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security released details on several people described as ""the worst of the worst"" that are being held inside the Broadview ICE processing center.

“Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living illegally in the United States for 10 years — what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns?” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated.

McLaughlin added that it is a felony for undocumented immigrants to possess firearms, and called Bojovic “a law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law.”

Bojovic recently graduated from the Suburban Law Enforcement Academy and had started a 15-week field training program, according to a Hanover Park Police Department Facebook post in August.

Village officials defended the hiring process. At a municipal meeting Thursday evening, Hanover Park Mayor Rodney Craig said Bojovic was legally authorized to work in the U.S. at the time of his hiring and passed background checks conducted by the FBI and Illinois State Police.

“If Officer Bojovic did not hold federal work authorization, he would not have been hired,” Craig said.

Craig added that the village will monitor Bojovic’s immigration proceedings and that, if he is ultimately allowed to remain in the U.S. and retain legal work status, he will be reinstated to full duty.

“The Trump administration is out of control, violating the rights of American citizens,” she continued. “They must be held accountable.”

The ProPublica investigation, published Thursday, identified cases of citizens being detained by ICE officers at raids or protests. Officers arrested about 130 U.S. citizens and held nearly two dozen for longer than a day without allowing them to call lawyers or family members.

Reporters found at least three instances of pregnant people being detained and multiple instances of citizens being shot, tased, beaten or otherwise physically harmed by officers.

This week, as a judge extended the order blocking federal troop deployments to Portland, Ore., Trump announced that he was considering sending troops to San Francisco, Calif. — another city he has mischaracterized as being crime-ridden.

As in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., such a deployment would directly oppose the wishes of state and local officials.

“Contrary to Trump’s lie, no ‘government officials’ here have requested federal occupation,” state Sen. Scott Weiner posted online Wednesday. “We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: stay the hell out of San Francisco.”

In other cities and states, Trump’s allies are using their official power to promote and expand the president’s military deployments on American soil. This week, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said that he hopes to have federal troops in the state by next month.

As these dangerous tactics escalate, we’re investigating Trump’s abuses of power, erosion of transparency, and efforts to use the presidency to punish perceived political opponents, including by usurping state and local power.

Trump’s unprecedented domestic deployments raise serious legal questions about the president’s authority. The governments of Portland and Oregon have sued Trump alleging the deployment was “patently unlawful” and violated the Constitution.

According to recent reporting, the Department of Defense and the White House have used Signal — a secretive, private, and non-governmental messaging app with auto-delete capabilities — to coordinate at least one of the deployments. We launched an investigation earlier this year when high level Trump administration officials reportedly used Signal to coordinate military attack plans in Yemen.

Leaked images of officials’ Signal conversations surfaced earlier this month, revealing details about the administration’s plan to deploy the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division to Portland.

Trump’s extraordinarily unusual deployments overstep the president’s authority and infringe on the power of state and local governments. These actions must not be normalized. We are committed to fighting for transparency, holding the government accountable and informing the public of efforts to seize control and consolidate executive power.

Demanding Answers about DHS’s Taxpayer-Funded ICE Recruitment Ads

As the government shutdown continues, it was revealed this week that the Department of Homeland Security has spent at least $51 million of taxpayer money to run advertisements thanking Donald Trump for his border policies and urging undocumented immigrants to self-deport. The campaign is reportedly the most expensive political ad campaign of the year.

The Trump administration is also spending millions more taxpayer dollars on television ads to recruit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as part of its $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 new ICE officers by the end of the year.

These ads are flooding Youtube, social media platforms, and streaming services like Spotify and Hulu. Thirty-second television ads playing in select cities urge current law enforcement officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst.”

To investigate ICE’s ad blitz, we submitted records requests for the agency’s communications, strategy documents regarding recruitment efforts, and advertising budgets.

ICE is also offering new recruits sign-on bonuses as large as $50,000 and up to $60,000 in student debt relief.

Those who decide to take the offer will join an agency whose budget has ballooned to $76.5 billion — 10 times its prior size — thanks to the spending bill Trump signed into law in July.

The administration hopes this influx of funding and officers will help it achieve its goals of arresting 3,000 immigrants each day and deporting one million people a year.

This rapid expansion comes as the Department of Homeland Security is cutting internal oversight and blocking external accountability.

This summer, DHS adopted a policy that blocks members of Congress from accessing detention facilities and the information needed to perform their legally authorized oversight duties. We are representing Congressional members in a lawsuit challenging the administration’s illegal blocking of ICE facility oversight.

At a time when ICE is detaining more individuals than ever before — over 56,000 people — and as reports of mistreatment, deplorable conditions, and in-custody deaths continue to mount, the need for oversight has never been more urgent.

We’re demanding the public and members of Congress have access to the information they need to hold ICE accountable.

This week, the House Judiciary Committee asked Smith to testify about his investigation into Trump before the end of the month.

In a letter to Smith, the committee chairman accused the special counsel of conducting “politically motivated investigations,” and the Biden-Harris Justice Department of having “weaponized federal law enforcement.”

Smith refuted accusations that politics played a role in the investigation of Trump’s mishandling of classified documents in an interview released this week.

We’re demanding answers about the administration’s use of executive power to target its political opponents and transparency about the special counsel’s findings. Read more here about our petition for the release of the report.

More than 70,000 agents serving exempted areas including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, the Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration will receive a ""super check"" on Oct. 22, Noem said in a statement on X.

""DHS remains deeply grateful to our law enforcement for their continued professionalism, vigilance, and service under challenging circumstances,"" Noem added.

Much of DHS is considered ""essential"" to government operations, so officers have remained on duty during the shutdown.

The shutdown entered its 17th day on Oct. 17 with no end in sight as lawmakers are at an impasse over federal funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year.

A tenth vote on Oct. 16 failed to reopen the government, and the Senate will vote again on a House-passed measure on Oct. 20. By that point, the shutdown will become the third-longest in history.

DHS officers will receive 'super check' covering shutdown back pay, Noem says

Noem said DHS officers will receive a ""super check"" on Wednesday, Oct. 22, covering all hours worked during the shutdown as well as the next pay period.

USA TODAY has reached out to DHS for more information.

Most government employees who are considered essential and therefore still working during the shutdown aren't getting paid.

Once Congress agrees on funding appropriations and the shutdown end, federal workers should get paid as usual in accordance with The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.

The Office of Management of Budget said in an Oct. 14 statement posted on X that the White House is “making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats’ intransigence.”

“Pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the (reductions in force), and wait,” the OMB added in the statement.

How many ICE, Border Patrol agents are working during shutdown?

It doesn't appear that the ""super check"" will be going to all of the exempted DHS employees who are still working during the shutdown.

Noem said that more than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers will receive the check.

Sworn officers are those who carry a firearm, have arrest power and a badge. Unlike unsworn officers, sworn officers must attend a law enforcement academy, according to Go Law Enforcement.

According to DHS' shutdown contingency plan, the agency has approximately 161,000 essential employees working under the ""necessary to protect life and property"" exception, which is inclusive of law enforcement officers.

That includes more than 63,000 Border Patrol, 19,000 ICE, 61,000 TSA and 8,000 Secret Service employees still working during the shutdown, per the plan.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/USAT/86745755007-20251016-t-174224-z-535581252-rc-2-d-4-haduh-0-z-rtrmadp-3-usashutdownlawenforcement.JPG?crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&width=2975&height=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-17 17:02:10.177851

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

There was a hastily called hearing Friday afternoon, in which Judge Sara Ellis told the government she wants live testimony Monday from someone from ICE and someone from Customs and Border Protection.

She said she wanted the witnesses to have knowledge of recent incidents and other enforcement operations in the Chicago area, along with knowledge of how the terms of her temporary restraining order have been disseminated to agents in the field.She did require that any particular person appear, but left it up to the government to produce the appropriate witnesses.

Hott was being asked to testify Monday about several incidents involving agents allegedly violating her order not to use tear gas against peaceful protesters without warning.

The Department of Justice is requesting that Customs and Border Protection Deputy Incident Cmdr. Kyle Harvick answer questions about those potential violations instead.

In a statement Friday, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""Russell Hott is the permanent Field Office Director (FOD) for the Washington, DC area of responsibility, not Chicago. He served in Chicago as interim FOD and this is planned return to his permanent office in DC. Samuel Olson, permanent FOD of St. Paul and former FOD of Chicago, will now be acting as interim FOD of Chicago.""

The government says it was CBP personnel that were ""mostly, if not entirely involved"" in two incidents in Chicago where plaintiffs allege federal agents violated the terms of the TRO by using force and deploying tear gas without the warnings required by the court's TRO.

""I just need somebody from ICE and Customs and Border Patrol to tell me what is happening and has been happening over the last week since I issued this order,"" Ellis said. ""It doesn't have to be complicated. I just need some people here that can answer the questions I have as to how this order has been disseminated, what happened with these various incidents over the last week - some of which I have found particularly concerning - and give me some belief that my order that I entered is being followed.""

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ellis modified an already existing temporary restraining order, or TRO, in place to require all agents working under ""Operation Midway Blitz"" who have already been issued body cameras to wear them and keep them on during ""law enforcement activities"" in Chicago.

In addition to Monday's hearing, Judge Ellis also set a Nov. 5 date for a preliminary injunction hearing to decide whether the TRO will remain in effect for a longer period.

Judge Ellis told the parties the ""ideological motivation"" behind the Administration's so-called Operation Midway Blitz is, so far, ""irrelevant"" to this case. Rather, the judge is focused on how agents are enforcing the law, and whether it's violating people's constitutional rights.

""What I'm looking at is how are these agents enforcing the law?"" Ellis said. ""Are they doing so in a manner that is violating other people's constitutional rights? If that is happening, that needs to stop.""

This is also the first Friday protest since the fencing came down, after it was ordered to be taken down by a judge.

A federal judge stated Thursday that she is ""profoundly concerned"" that federal agents working on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area are violating restrictions put in place when it comes to the use of tear gas

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed a petition this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order.
He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.
Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE” “ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said.","Cook County‘s top judge has signed an order barring ICE from arresting people at courthouses. Cook County includes Chicago, which has seen a federal immigration crackdown in recent months.

Detaining residents outside court has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July. Representatives said they’ve seen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed a petition this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations. It also has drawn lawsuits from some states and the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Asked about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done, because what’s happening with these ICE agents and courthouses and territories around courthouses is unacceptable,” Welch said. “People are afraid to go to court. They’re afraid to comply with subpoenas. We can’t allow that. These should be safe spaces.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed street chase on Chicago’s South Side.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events citywide and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three detained recently.",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/AP25288660208628.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:03:45.652285

United Auto Workers, Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Teachers sued the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This comes after the State Department said it had revoked the visas of at least six people over social media comments made about late conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his murder last month.

""Plaintiffs represent thousands of people whose speech is chilled by the threat of adverse immigration action if the government disapproves of anything they have expressed or will express,"" the lawsuit reads.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO VET LEGAL IMMIGRANT APPLICANTS FOR 'ANTI-AMERICANISM' AND ANTISEMITISM

Administration officials have purported that foreigners do not have the same constitutional rights as U.S. citizens and do not have a right to hold a visa, as the federal government seeks to target them for speech.

""The United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country, commit acts of anti-American, pro-terrorist, and antisemitic hate, or incite violence. We will continue to revoke the visas of those who put the safety of our citizens at risk,"" State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

The lawsuit points to high-profile cases and the comments of federal officials to argue that a government program uses artificial intelligence and other automated tools for surveillance of visa holders' posts and targets people critical of the Trump administration and what the government considers to be ""hateful ideology.""

The federal government has broadly defined support for terrorism to include criticism of U.S. support for Israel and the Jewish State's military action, as well as support for Palestinians. The government has used this as a justification to cancel visas.

FEDERAL JUDGE LAUNCHES SCATHING BROADSIDE OF TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO DEPORT PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS

The unions' complaint cited the case of green card holder Mahmoud Khalil, who was released in June following months in detention after the government attempted to deport him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University.

The lawsuit said the immigration threats over views disapproved by the government have prompted some union members to withdraw from publicly affiliating with their unions at organizing events, step down from leadership roles and ""deleted, refrained from, or otherwise altered their social media and online engagement with the unions.""

""This loss of engagement has harmed the plaintiffs’ ability to further their organizational missions and impeded their ability to carry out their responsibilities, which include recruitment, retention, and organization of union members; advocacy on behalf of union members; and the promotion of civic and political engagement among union members,"" the lawsuit said.

The outcome maintains the status quo for many H-4 visa holders currently authorized to work in the United States.

Save Jobs USA, an organization of American tech workers, filed suit challenging a 2015 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that allows certain H-4 visa holders whose H-1B spouses are on the path to permanent residency to apply for employment authorization. H-4 visas are granted to dependent family members of H-1B specialty occupation workers, a category widely used in the technology, healthcare, and other sectors.

Save Jobs USA argued that DHS exceeded its statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act by extending employment authorization for a visa class not explicitly authorized by Congress and that the rule harmed American workers by increasing labor market competition. The group also claimed that a circuit split existed regarding the scope of DHS’s regulatory authority, which warranted Supreme Court review.

The federal government responded that Save Jobs USA lacked standing to challenge the rule and disputed the existence of a circuit split.

The denial of certiorari leaves in place the lower court rulings that the DHS acted within its statutory authority when it promulgated the 2015 rule.

(KOIN) – A clash between an ambulance crew and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stalled a medical transport at the South Portland ICE facility earlier this month.

On Oct. 5, our footage captured a group of protestors outside Portland’s ICE facility.

The incident between AMR and ICE allegedly ended in a federal agent threatening to shoot an ambulance driver, according to leaked documents first reported by Willamette Week.

While details of the allegations are unconfirmed by officials, KOIN 6 News has confirmed that American Medical Response (AMR) leaders and Teamster union members met with the Federal Protective Service on Wednesday night to discuss the incident. However, no officials are commenting during the ongoing investigation.

Portland Fire and Rescue records and radio dispatch obtained by KOIN 6 News show that ICE detained a suspect that night, described as a 32-year-old white man with a broken collar bone.

Bureau of Emergency Communications dispatch records show an AMR ambulance was called to the ICE facility at 9:14 p.m. to transport the man to Legacy Emanuel Hospital. Public records show that the ambulance arrived within five minutes, but there was some kind of hold up when the ambulance tried to leave at 9:34 p.m.

According to the radio records, at 9:34 p.m. the EMT driving the ambulance told dispatch that they were “not being allowed to leave by the ICE officers.” The EMT reiterated this again over the radio at 9:40 p.m.

Portland police radio recordings provide a similar account, stating that “protesters are out of the way” and that it “looks like they’re getting ready to open the gates soon.”

However, the ambulance was still not on the road.

“There’s 50-60 federal agents out there completely blocking the road with the ambulance, still not driving out yet,” a Portland police officer said to dispatch.

What exactly happened behind the gates for those roughly 10 minutes is not revealed in public documents.

However, police radio transcripts from outside the building around that same time appear to show that law enforcement was working on clearing the roads of some people.

Our camera crew captured video of the ambulance leaving the ICE facility, and the EMT is heard on the radio at 9:42 p.m. saying she “finally made it on the road – CODE 1 to Emanuel.”

KOIN 6 News reached out to AMR, which shared the following statement:

“The safety and wellbeing of our public service partners, employees, patients and community members remain paramount to AMR Multnomah County (AMR). AMR is collaborating closely with Federal Protective Service to thoroughly review all aspects related to this incident.

“To protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation, we are unable to offer further commentary or disclose additional details. We reaffirm our commitment to the residents of Multnomah County, ensuring continued focus on quality care, and will uphold support for both our caregivers, partners and patients as we honor the trust placed in our organization each day.”

KOIN 6 News also reached out to ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but neither agency has responded to the request for comment.

Paramedics familiar with the incident told KOIN 6 the two employees involved were initially “shaken” but felt better after the meeting on Wednesday. Medics, however, said they are looking to AMR leadership to provide safety during these tense times.

“We stand against assault on our health care providers just as we stand against assault on our community. We continue to do our part, our leadership needs to do the same in keeping everyone safe,” Tim Mollman said, a paramedic with AMR.

Austin DePaolo, the Secretary-Treasurer with the Teamsters Local 223 union, shared the following statement:

“Our Teamster 223 EMS members at AMR respond to all calls with the same professionalism and composure they bring to every emergency. We appreciate that federal agents have since been cooperative and open to learn from this experience as we have. We all share a common goal, ensuring the safety of patients, first responders, and the public and we’re encouraged that constructive dialogue is taking place to prevent any similar incidents in the future.”

According to court documents, a teacher had led her to believe—falsely, it turned out—that she was already a lawful permanent resident.
In a public statement issued shortly after her arrest, the Department of Homeland Security mistakenly identified her as a Columbia student.
According to court documents, the money came from her waitressing job and from contributions from her neighbors.
According to court documents filed in August, Kordia has lost a significant amount of weight in detention.","On a Monday afternoon in late September, a group of students and professors from Columbia University stood outside the campus gates, holding large printed photos of people whom the U.S. government is seeking to deport. After two tumultuous years of protests, multiple waves of arrests, and, ultimately, a two-hundred-and-twenty-one-million-dollar settlement with the Trump Administration, the university has returned to something resembling normality. But such gatherings remain commonplace, often with members of the faculty holding photos of Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, whose highly publicized cases made them symbols of the government’s crackdown on student protesters. That day, someone held the photo of a woman largely unknown to the public: Leqaa Kordia, who was not a Columbia student but “a simple Palestinian girl,” as she describes herself, who’s been in ICE detention in Texas for the past eight months.

On March 13, 2025, just five days after Khalil, a green-card holder who is married to a U.S citizen, was arrested, Kordia walked into an immigration office in Newark. A few days earlier, agents from the Department of Homeland Security had visited her mother’s home, in Paterson, New Jersey. The agents took a photo of a sign that said “Palestine” on the family’s front porch. Kordia’s mother, who struggled to communicate with them, called her daughter. The agents told Kordia, who was in the process of obtaining a green card, that there was a problem with her immigration status and that they needed to speak with her. And so, accompanied by a lawyer, she presented herself at the office in Newark, assuming that the matter would be easily cleared up. Her stepfather and her sister waited for her in the car.

Until then, Kordia’s life had been fairly ordinary. She had never been convicted of a crime, and she was in the middle of a lawful immigration process. “I honestly didn’t think that it’s going to be a big deal,” she said. “I literally was thinking that there was maybe a small issue in my application.” Instead, she says, she was taken through “many stairs and doors,” before being locked in a cell. It was Ramadan, but few religious accommodations were provided—the guards Googled the direction of Mecca, and Kordia laid out toilet paper on the floor of her cell to pray. A few hours later, she was put on a flight to Texas, but the documents she was given said she’d been transferred to upstate New York. Officers were apparently confused. “Good luck understanding anything in this file,” an official who had flown with her from New Jersey reportedly said, when Kordia’s file was handed over to agents in Texas, according to court documents.

Kordia, who is thirty-two, has lived in the United States since 2016. She was born in Jerusalem and grew up in Ramallah, in the West Bank. Her parents divorced when she was a child. She and her brother stayed with their father. Her mother moved to the United States, remarried, and had other children. In Ramallah, Kordia would watch videos of people around the world protesting for Palestinian rights, something she herself was unable to do in the West Bank. “Growing up under military occupation, that itself is a nightmare,” she said. “I’ve never had any day of freedom or peace.”

She eventually reunited with her mother in 2016, when she entered the U.S. on a visitor visa. In Ramallah, she had studied fashion design; in the U.S, she enrolled in English-language programs on an F-1 student visa. Her mother, who is a U.S. citizen, filed a family-based petition for her to start the process of obtaining permanent residency, which was approved in 2021. While waiting for a green card, Kordia withdrew from school, voluntarily giving up her student status. According to court documents, a teacher had led her to believe—falsely, it turned out—that she was already a lawful permanent resident. In the years that followed, she cared for her mother, worked as a waitress, and helped look after her half brother, who is autistic. Paterson, which has a large Palestinian and Arab community, began to feel like home.

Since Israel launched its war on Gaza, following Hamas’s attacks on October 7, 2023, Kordia has lost more than a hundred and seventy-five relatives in the Strip. “My mind was all about Gaza, nothing else,” she said. The stories she heard from family members were horrifying. They were continuously displaced from one city to the next, fleeing for safety, only to confront more immediate dangers. Kordia, feeling “heartbroken,” didn’t know what to do. “To feel helpless—this is one of the most awful feelings in the world,” she said, adding that one of her aunts had already lost her home during Israeli bombardments in 2021. “There is no safe place in Gaza.”

As Kordia watched loved ones going hungry or being indiscriminately killed, protest became her only lifeline. She was accustomed to going to New York, a forty-five-minute train ride from Paterson, to visit museums and stroll the city’s streets. On April 30, 2024, as Columbia students erected encampments in solidarity with Palestinians, attracting international attention, she joined a demonstration outside the university’s gates, calling for an end to the violence. Police ordered the crowd to disperse. “Something you only see in movies,” she said of the display of force. Kordia, who felt lightheaded, sat on a sidewalk and was swept up in the arrests; she was handcuffed and shuttled by bus to police headquarters, where she was forced to remove her hijab for a search. The next morning, she was released with a notice to appear in court. The charges were later dismissed. She assumed that was the end of it.

When Kordia was arrested in March, the government accused her of terrorism. In a public statement issued shortly after her arrest, the Department of Homeland Security mistakenly identified her as a Columbia student. “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, said. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.” According to a report by the Associated Press, the N.Y.P.D. had turned over evidence of her arrest at the student demonstrations to ICE.

The government claims that money that Kordia sent to her family in Gaza—a few thousand U.S. dollars in total—is evidence of material support for Hamas. According to court documents, the money came from her waitressing job and from contributions from her neighbors. In late June, a federal judge concluded that Kordia’s detention likely violated her constitutional right to due process and recommended her release. No convincing evidence linking her to terrorist activity had been brought up. In response, the government contended that she posed a flight risk. Her petition is now pending in federal court alongside a separate asylum proceeding. “It breaks my heart to be labelled as something that I have nothing to do with,” she said.

In early October, the Trump Administration helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which included an exchange of hostages and prisoners. “Together we’ve achieved what everybody said was impossible,” President Trump said. “At long last we have peace in the Middle East.” Kordia, meanwhile, is the last remaining campus protester still in detention from the Trump Administration’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the U.S. At Prairieland Detention Facility, in Texas, she is fighting for her release while living in constant fear of deportation. She holds a passport from the Palestinian Authority, a travel document that offers no protection if she is deported to Israel. Such deportation, her legal team contends, would send her into the custody of the same Army that has killed dozens of her family members. Both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority have targeted those accused of being affiliated with Hamas. Photos of Kordia have circulated widely online. Her lawyers say that the gravity of the allegations against her have compelled her to seek asylum. “I’m not just scared—I’m terrified,” Kordia said. “I’m terrified of being subjected to jail, torture even. It could get to the point of getting killed.”

In the facility, Kordia spends her days reading, praying, writing in her journal, and answering letters of support. She also finds solace and strength in the friendships she’s developed with the other detainees. “They’re beautiful women with dreams. They’re educated. They’re smart. They’re funny,” she said. “These beautiful women made it bearable.” She formed a particularly strong bond with Ward Sakeik, a Palestinian woman whose family is from Gaza. Sakeik was arrested by ICE in February while returning from her honeymoon in St. Thomas. In July, she was released.

According to court documents filed in August, Kordia has lost a significant amount of weight in detention. The filing noted that Kordia, a practicing Muslim, “has only had a single halal meal on a religious holiday, even though the detention center accommodates the religious dietary needs of other people in custody.” Kordia said the Quran helps her stay strong, especially the verses that remind her that hardships can be a divine test. One reads, “God does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.” Kordia added, “Allah has chosen me for this, and I should be honored and proud.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68ee8b10bafe39542db3313e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Alami_Final.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 14:03:18.763909

The mother of two girls says she has seen how her neighbors have been chased down by immigration enforcement agents.
He says he's always ready to confront ICE agents with non-aggressive tactics, like annoying them with loud noises.","HANOVER PARK, Ill. — Nearly a dozen kids come around the block, some running and others riding their bikes. They are heading straight to the gap between the grocery store and the old apartment building — the same area where Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans often park.

""We heard they were here so that's why we came,"" a kid says to another one.

By ""they"" he means ICE agents. He and the other kids were ready to start recording the latest immigration enforcement action in their neighborhood.

An organizer with Patrulla Popular, or the People's Patrol, an all-volunteer group of activists, is nearby and approaches the kids.

""You guys need to keep yourselves safe, OK? You guys need to be careful,"" Ruby tells the kids. She asked to only be identified by her first name because she fears retaliation for her work warning people about ICE's presence.

She says the kids should document everything they see while keeping their distance. This could help eventually identify the undocumented immigrants being taken away by federal immigration agents.

She also tells them one of the goals should be to alert everyone around them about the presence of ICE. She gives them whistles.

""When you see somebody and you see a car or something suspicious, you do a break of a whistle,"" Ruby says, meaning a soft series of whistles. ""If you see somebody being detained the whistle is long, as loud as you can.""

Ruby is part of a growing number of volunteer groups who, along with advocates and lawyers, are patrolling the streets of Chicago and its suburbs warning migrants of ICE's presence, contacting family members of those detained and linking detained immigrants with legal services.

From the building's main balcony a group of adult immigrants, many without a legal status, listens as she reminds them of their rights if they were to interact with ICE.

""Do not sign anything without having talked to an attorney,"" she tells them in Spanish.

Residents in this area say they have been terrorized since last month, when the Trump administration ramped up its crackdown on immigration in Illinois under ICE's Operation Midway Blitz.

One of the residents watching is Diana, a Mexican woman who NPR is only identifying by her first name because she's undocumented.

""I'm panicking, I don't want to leave my place,"" she says in Spanish.

The mother of two girls says she has seen how her neighbors have been chased down by immigration enforcement agents. In this apartment building, some adults have decided to stay home and not go to work, and to not send their kids to school.

But there's one person she says is giving her hope.

His name is Ivan and he's 17. He has taken on the unlikely role of protector, often patrolling his neighborhood daily starting around 5 a.m.

""I may not be no cop or none of that, but I be taking care of the community,"" Ivan says. ""I don't want none of these people get deported.""

NPR is identifying Ivan only by his first name because he's a minor.

Witnessing ICE arresting people in this area has become an almost daily occurrence over the last few weeks, Ivan says. A few days ago, he took a video of an enforcement operation happening at the nearby grocery store.

Ivan says every day he tries to keep an eye out for suspicious cars. They could be ICE, he says. His goal is to give migrants enough time to either hide or flee if agents are around.

""All these people make the U.S. work,"" Ivan says. ""Without them how is the U.S. gonna be?""

Cristóbal Cavazos is also a volunteer with the People's Patrol, and the co-founder of Casa DuPage Workers Center.

He says he's always ready to confront ICE agents with non-aggressive tactics, like annoying them with loud noises.

""I will take out my bullhorn, I will start to make some noise, people start to honk their horns, people start to pull up,"" Cavazos says. ""ICE starts to get nervous. They start to look around, you know, and they start to assess, is this worth it right now?""

But increasingly, federal immigration agents have responded with force.

Recently, Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd who had gathered in Chicago's East Side to protest after a crash between the officers and someone they were chasing.

Cavazos says this work — chasing leads or even, at times, following ICE agents — to alert the community can be hard, especially now that the Department of Homeland Security regularly accuses groups like Cavazos' of interfering with their jobs and endangering the lives of immigration officers.

The Trump administration has loudly denounced activist volunteers like Cavazos accusing them of interfering with their jobs and endangering the lives of immigration officers.

""There's that fear,"" Cavazos says. ""But if you're a real community activist, you need to do what's right for your community in spite of the fear … because it is a scary time right now.""

But he remains defiant.

Every morning, with his mate tea in hand, Cavazos checks his phone to verify whether there has been any sighting of ICE agents in the Chicago suburbs.

He sees the role of the People's Patrol as not only helping migrants feel safe and have reliable information, but also fighting for free speech and the right to protest — two things he says the Trump administration is trying to quash.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5712x3213+0+536/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff%2Fed%2Fed2aed4f4824a00c54648f112f13%2Fimg-4445.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:03:22.484923

Latest on Litigation

Doe v. Noem is a case challenging the mass termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes and thehalting of adjudications of immigration applications for parolees who entered on CHNV and other parole programs including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and family reunification parole.

Here’s where we are:

In late September, plaintiffs in the case presented Judge Talwani of the District Court of Massachusetts examples of USCIS refusing to adjudicate adjustment of status applications of people who arrived through U4U and CHNV. In response, DHS insisted that there is no “categorical hold” on adjudications and provided statistics on the number of parolee applications adjudicated, asserting that between May 28 and September 15, it had adjudicated over 52,000 applications filed by people who had arrived on U4U, CHNV, and family based parole programs, including over 4,300 adjustment applications. DHS clarified that many applications are, however, going through additional review, investigation, and vetting. On October 9, Judge Talwani of the District Court of Massachusetts denied the government’s request to stay litigation over the issue of application adjudication during the government shut down, noting that doing so would “further prolong the period during which class members’ future immigration status remains uncertain” and given that “the federal government will continue immigration enforcement during the government shutdown.”

CHIRLA v. Noem is a case challenging the administration’s placement of people who entered through parole into expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.

Here’s where we are:

As we reported last month, on September 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the district court’s order protecting people paroled into the United States from expedited removal. This ruling leaves in place the district court’s order, issued on August 1, which found that it was unlawful to place those who entered on humanitarian parole into expedited removal. This means that any person who entered on parole should insist that DHS cannot place them in expedited removal per the lower court’s decision. Here is a practice alert from the National Immigration Project of the Lawyer’s Guild explaining what to do should someone who entered through a port of entry on parole is nonetheless placed in expedited removal.

Sileiri Doe et. al. v. DHS et. al. is a new class action lawsuit filed on August 11 challenging mass termination of parole and revocation of work authorization of people who waited for CBP One appointments and entered through land border ports of entry.

Here’s where we are:

In late September and early October, the two sides in the case presented opposing views of the mass termination. DHS claims “[t]he reasons why a person was granted parole can vary widely” and that people who came into the country using CBP One don’t constitute a harmed class. But lawyers for the parolees assert mass termination was done “in one stroke” to everyone who came to the U.S. through use of the CBP One app. The fact that DHS has discretion to terminate individual paroles does not make mass termination lawful, they argue.

Latest on Enforcement Policies

On October 3, the Supreme Court sanctioned the termination of Venezuela TPS, throwing over 300,000 Venezuelans out of status immediately and several hundred thousand more on November 7. Without TPS, Venezuelans can be arrested, detained, and deported. Congress must provide a solution for Venezuelans and many TPS holders from other countries who are integral members of U.S. communities and at risk of deportation to danger. You can support the National TPS Alliance’s push for legislative reform here.

Two recently implemented policies attest to the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to make parole extremely expensive to attain and to starve out parolees who want to work to support their families. On October 16, the administration began charging a $1,000 fee to anyone granted parole or re-parole, which is in addition to a $580 application fee. These new fees were authorized by the reconciliation package that passed in July. And the Department of Transportation has published a rule that denies those with work permits based on parole status (or asylum applications, TPS status, and most other immigration statuses) eligibility for commercial vehicle licenses, shutting them out of the trucking industry. Several commercial truckers who came in on parole programs and through CBP One appointments have also recently been arrested at weigh stations and interior border patrol check points in Texas and Oklahoma.

The major ongoing immigration enforcement campaigns in Washington DC and Chicago are arbitrary – indiscriminately targeting people who have been living in the cities for decades and those who have more recently arrived on humanitarian parole after entering with CBP One appointments at the border. This has led to increasing legal challenges and solidarity in opposition to the Trump administration’s detention and deportation agenda.

For example, on August 15, a Venezuelan who entered at the border in 2024 with a CBP One appointment and has a pending asylum application was arrested while on his motorbike to do a DoorDash delivery in Washington, DC. Federal officials took him first to the ICE facility in Chantilly, Virginia and then to one in Caroline, where he has developed a rash and severe anxiety while he awaits his court hearing. He is part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of members of the organization CASA and others arrested in DC without a warrant and probable cause. Similarly, on September 9, a Venezuelan man who was paroled after entering in 2023 with a CBP One appointment was arrested during a raid outside the Home Depot on Cicero Avenue in Chicago, though he had documents in his backpack attesting to his temporary protected status. A federal judge has ruled such arbitrary, warrantless arrests violate a court settlement in northern Illinois and similar cases should be referred to NIJC here.

Refugees International is keeping track and collecting stories of enforcement against people who arrived on parole, so please send Yael Schacher the data and accounts you have. In coming newsletters we will be taking stock of what extant data reveals about enforcement against humanitarian parolees. By elevating this data and the stories of people affected, we can contribute to the growing public backlash against the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. New polling from the Refugee Advocacy Lab, Refugees International, and Data for Progress indicate that 59 percent of U.S. voters oppose the Trump administration deporting people who entered the U.S. legally on humanitarian status and are now living and working in U.S. communities.

Latest from Congress

Amid the U.S. government shutdown, the Administration has markedly intensified immigration enforcement operations in major cities—most prominently in Chicago, as discussed above. Several members of Illinois’s Democratic congressional delegation have been denied access to conduct oversight visits at local ICE facilities, including in districts directly affected by enforcement activity. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, condemned what he described as an unprovoked and dangerous escalation of immigration enforcement in Chicago and across the country. According to Administration officials, plans are underway to further expand these operations, leveraging resources from the July reconciliation package, which allocated historic levels of funding to the Department of Homeland Security.

Queer and trans immigrants at a detention facility in south Louisiana have alleged that they faced sexual harassment and abuse, medical neglect and coerced labor by staff at the facility, and that they were repeatedly ignored or faced retaliation for speaking out. In multiple legal complaints, immigrants detained at the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center (SLIPC) in Basile, Louisiana, said they were recruited into an unsanctioned work program that forced them to perform hard manual labor for as little as $1 per day. Detainees also alleged that queer people were targeted by an assistant warden who stalked, harassed and sexually assaulted them.

By doubling down whenever challenged, the Trump administration is creating a negative feedback loop which is leading both sides to harden their opposition.
In short, the administration’s mass deportation is creating a tinderbox that makes all Americans less safe — including DHS officers themselves.","On September 24, 2025, a disturbed young man climbed to the roof of a building outside the Dallas Field Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and opened fire. Before he took his own life, his bullets struck three handcuffed immigrants. Norlan Guzman-Fuentes died at the scene and a second man, Miguel Ángel García, died at the hospital days later. A third man, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, remains hospitalized.

Like multiple shootings in recent months, finding the truth about a motive may never be possible among the fog of internet memes and punditry hypothesizing. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has seized on the moment to declare that the cause is clear; “hateful rhetoric” that is “demonizing” ICE.

The Dallas shooting, in the view of the Department of Homeland Security, is one of many acts of “political violence” inspired by “rhetoric” that has led to “assaults against our brave DHS law enforcement.” In a video entitled “Dangerous Democrat Rhetoric Against ICE” posted by the White House, the administration suggests that everything from California Governor Newsom calling for ICE agents to “unmask yourselves,” to more aggressive comparisons between secret police and internment camps, are a direct cause of violence against ICE.

It’s true that heated rhetoric around immigration has increased in recent years. During the Biden administration and presidential election cycle, this involved candidates and politicians making xenophobic claims of Great Replacement, migrant “invasions,” and Haitian refugees eating pets. Under Trump, the rhetorical battle around immigration has worsened, with public officials calling for “remigration,” Cabinet secretaries accusing opponents of supporting pedophiles, and where even America’s legal immigration agency is now hiring “homeland defenders” to “protect our nation and defend your culture.”

But it is not the words of politicians which are driving some people to become increasingly opposed and outspoken against federal immigration enforcers. Nor is it political rhetoric which has been met with an unprecedented street-level pushback against immigration law enforcement. It is the Trump administration’s radical shift away from standard law enforcement principles and toward a “mass deportation” agenda, as well as the related tactics which are focused more on creating content and hitting arrest quotas than on public safety and national security.

We all want to be safe, and we want law enforcement to adopt policies that keep us safe — and make communities feel safe. It’s also true that ICE officers have a genuine concern for their own safety. Yet the Trump administration’s aggressive mass deportation operations are premised on an explicit goal of making immigrant communities feel unsafe; to frighten millions of immigrants into “self-deportation.” And when communities feel unsafe, the natural reaction is to direct blame towards the most visible cause — increased immigration enforcement and the people carrying it out.

The Trump administration’s campaign of fear is being carried out through aggressive changes in immigration enforcement. Thousands of federal agents from the DEA, ATF, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies have been reassigned to carry out immigration enforcement. The White House has set politically motivated arrest quotas and ordered ICE to stop focusing on people with criminal records and instead raid businesses and trawl public places. DHS is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on nationwide ad campaigns telling people to self-deport. The man in charge of the Los Angeles and Chicago raids has openly told reporters that agents are targeting people for stops based on “how they look.”

This mass deportation effort has led to images and videos of law enforcement agents taking actions that shock many Americans to the core — as it is explicitly intended to do. In the United States, we have little history of masked federal agents jumping out of unmarked vehicles to arrest people at Home Depot, or detaining sobbing immigrant families at courthouses. This clear break from American norms is increasingly unpopular, and has caused President Trump’s polling average on immigration to fall by more than 15 points since taking office.

As federal agents become more aggressive in public spaces, both physically and verbally, images and videos of these operations are circulating social media and going viral. Like the video of George Floyd slowly being starved of oxygen as a police officer sat on his chest, these videos motivated many who might not otherwise care about the issue to be shocked into action. The administration’s constant propaganda about the “worst of the worst” and smearing people who support due process as terrorist-lovers raises the temperature even further. By doubling down whenever challenged, the Trump administration is creating a negative feedback loop which is leading both sides to harden their opposition.

Opaque, aggressive, and seemingly indiscriminate acts of immigration enforcement are now creating new scandals on a near-daily basis, with a growing number of U.S. citizens and others with legal status alleging lengthy detentions and racial profiling. But instead of taking accountability for the inevitable consequences any such abuse of law enforcement power, the administration is instead unabashedly disregarding oversight requirements and blaming others for any unrest.

One of the most egregious examples of this lack of accountability came in late September, where DHS initially suspended an officer for violently shoving a sobbing woman onto the floor of the New York Immigration Court, sending her to the hospital. On September 26, the officer responsible was suspended and DHS’s own spokesperson declared that his conduct was “unacceptable.” Yet by September 29, he was reportedly back on duty.

Unsurprisingly then, the number of protestors and activists opposing ICE’s actions have continued to grow — not top down, from the mouths of politicians, but from the grass roots. This is a direct response to the actions that normal people are seeing in their communities, as well as the rhetoric and lack of accountability they are seeing from the leaders in the White House and DHS. Adding to the sense of anger is the fact that the Trump admin is diverting extensive resources away from other public safety priorities, including political violence, terrorism, and child exploitation while simultaneously undermining public trust in all law enforcement.

Beyond acknowledging the need for accountability, the government could also protect its people better if it didn’t continue to push them to engage in behaviors which Americans view as fundamentally antithetical to professional law enforcement — like masking, refusal to provide identification, and racial profiling. We all have a responsibility to speak out against things we believe the government is doing that are wrong. That should never mean violence. But in a world in which every person can see daily violations of the basic norms of American law enforcement, an official position of impunity is going to radicalize people further. And that is a problem that cannot be solved by chastising Democratic politicians.

In short, the administration’s mass deportation is creating a tinderbox that makes all Americans less safe — including DHS officers themselves. And if the administration keeps barging forward without any changes, there is a real risk that this cycle will keep growing until another tragedy like Dallas occurs.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-287g-communities.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:03:01.630713

Among the worst of the worst arrested during operation Patriot 2.0:","BOSTON — ICE and federal law enforcement partners apprehended more than 1,400 illegal aliens during a weeks-long immigration enforcement operation focusing on transnational organized crime, gangs and egregious illegal alien offenders throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. During the surge operation Patriot 2.0, officers from ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston and ICE Homeland Security Investigations New England joined forces with partners from the FBI; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the DEA; the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to arrest an astounding 1,406 illegal alien offenders from Sept. 4 to Sept. 30.

“Patriot 2.0 exposed the grave consequences of sanctuary policies and the urgent need for local leaders to prioritize their constituents’ safety over politics,” said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “Every illegal alien we arrested during the operation was breaking U.S. immigration law, and hundreds were violent criminals who should never have been allowed to roam freely in our communities. Local law enforcement agencies released them instead of handing them over to us in a secure environment, and this puts neighborhoods, law enforcement officers and illegal aliens at risk. Local politicians are responsible for protecting their constituents, so they need to step up and end irresponsible sanctuary policies.”

More than 600 illegal aliens arrested had significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives. Throughout the duration of Operation Patriot 2.0, ICE and its federal law enforcement partners targeted egregious criminal alien offenders, including transnational criminal organizations known to operate in and around Boston and throughout Massachusetts. These organizations include the notorious MS-13, Tren de Aragua, Trinitarios and 18th Street gangs. Six of those arrested were documented members of transnational criminal gangs while several others were gang associates.

ICE and its federal law enforcement partners prosecuted numerous targets who had foreign arrest warrants and Interpol Red Notices, apprehending criminal alien offenders wanted by authorities in several foreign countries. Three of those arrested were known or suspected terrorists.

“The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is a significantly safer place to live and work thanks to the hard work and determination of the men and women of ICE and our federal partners. Working together, we were able to arrest more than 1,400 illegal aliens throughout the commonwealth, many of whom had significant criminality in the United States or abroad,” said ICE ERO Boston acting Field Office Director David Wesling. “These include criminal offenders who victimized innocent people and traumatized entire communities — murderers, rapists, drug traffickers, child sex predators and members of violent transnational criminal gangs. All made the mistake of attempting to undermine U.S. immigration law by hiding out in Massachusetts.”

“We continue to work alongside our federal partners to rid our great country of murderers, child predators, gang members, drug traffickers and many more,” said ICE HSI New England Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol. “Public safety and national security remain our number one priority, and we will not relent.”

“Operation Patriot 2.0 should send a clear and unmistakable message: If you are in this country illegally, hiding out and committing crimes, the FBI and our partners will find you, we will arrest you, and we will remove you from our communities,” said Ted E. Docks, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division. “This latest surge led to the arrests of more than 1,400 illegal aliens, many with violent criminal records. Hundreds were ordered to leave the U.S. but remained here illegally. These are not harmless individuals in search of a better life, they are threats to public safety. The FBI will not sit idly by and let our immigration system be exploited because the rule of law is not optional.”

ICE and its federal law enforcement partners made many of the apprehensions after local jurisdictions refused to honor immigration detainer requests to turn over the offenders and instead chose to release them from custody, forcing officers and agents to make at-large arrests in Massachusetts communities.

“The U.S. attorney’s office will continue to prioritize working with our law enforcement partners to root out and prosecute individuals who are illegally in the United States and breaking federal laws,” said U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley. “By removing these individuals, we have made our communities safer.”

Among the alien offenders apprehended during Operation Patriot 2.0, 277 had been previously ordered removed from the United States by a Justice Department immigration judge. However, they refused to comply with their removal orders and remained in the country illegally.

“ATF is always proud to support our federal, state and local law enforcement partners as they work to protect our communities,” said ATF Boston Special Agent in Charge Thomas Greco. “We will continue to seek the removal of anyone engaged in criminal conduct while unlawfully present in the United States.”

“The Diplomatic Security Service is proud to stand alongside our federal law enforcement partners to disrupt transnational organized crime and illegal alien offenders in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,” said DSS Boston Special Agent in Charge Matthew O’Brien. “Operation Patriot 2.0 demonstrates our shared commitment to protecting our communities, upholding the rule of law, and safeguarding national security.”

All aliens detained during Operation Patriot will remain in ICE custody pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their deportation from the United States.

On September 29, 2025, in what has become a shockingly common occurrence, Huabing Xie died in ICE custody after suffering an apparent seizure. Xie, a citizen of China, is the 23rd person officially reported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to have died in custody this fiscal year, marking 2025 as the deadliest for ICE detainees since 2004. As of writing, two more people have died in ICE detention since the fiscal year ended on September 30.

The first year of the second Trump administration has been even deadlier than 2020, when the unchecked COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the high death toll in detention facilities. The rising fatalities this year are likely caused by several factors, including acute overcrowding, abysmal detention conditions, medical neglect, soaring mental distress, and even gun violence.

Why are so many people dying in ICE custody?

In less than a year, the Trump administration has increased the number of people detained in ICE facilities by almost 50%. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) incarcerates close to 60,000 people. The administration’s push for mass detentions and deportations has led to overcrowding as most facilities now exceed their contractual capacity.

Across detention centers, overcrowding has resulted in dire and inhumane conditions. For example, a Massachusetts ICE field office used a windowless room as a holding area packed with “35 to 40 men” who had to share one toilet without privacy and sleep “head-by-toe” on the concrete floors. Similarly, at Krome Service Processing Center in Florida, people were forced to sleep on the floor and only given “a cup of rice and a glass of water a day.” ICE is refusing to give people enough food in some facilities and provides rotten food at other facilities. These reports are understandably alarming family members and advocates.

Overcrowding and poor hygiene can spread and exacerbate diseases, leading to deaths. But medical neglect in detention can lead to equally harmful consequences. Sick detainees are being denied care, leading to unnecessarily worsening medical conditions. NPR reported that a man with a “serious eye infection for almost two weeks” and a “fever” was denied medication for both conditions.

In another instance, a previously healthy 23-year-old man was unable to walk due to pain after only a few months in ICE confinement because of medical neglect. The Venezuelan asylum seeker was frequently moved between detention centers without the ability to shower or change his clothing, forced to sleep on the floor, and frequently complained of pain. Nurses prescribed him antibiotics and pain medication, but his medical records show that he rarely actually received his prescriptions, and that ICE took his medications from him when it transferred him between detention centers. Ultimately, his symptoms worsened so acutely that he was “taken to medical in a wheelchair, assisted by fellow detainees, because he was unable to walk on his own.” This young man’s story is just one example of countless horrifying incidents occurring out of the public eye.

The Trump administration’s immigration detention policies and the resulting appalling conditions have also led to disastrous effects on detainees’ mental health. Three of the reported deaths are by apparent suicide. Twenty-seven-year-old Brayan Rayo-Garzon was found “unresponsive in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck” in April 2025. During his two-week detention, his appointment with the mental health clinic was rescheduled twice. In June, Jesus Molina-Veya was discovered “unresponsive with a cloth ligature around his neck tied to the bottom rail of the top bunk.” Chaofeng Ge was also found “with a cloth ligature around his neck in a shower stall” four days after his intake assessment. Many other people have reported experiencing acute mental distress in detention, including suicidal thoughts.

And noncitizens in ICE detention have another deadly threat to worry about: gun violence. Two people detained by ICE were killed by a gunman opening fire on an ICE facility in Dallas. This fatal incident was the third shooting at a federal immigration facility in Texas in recent months, bolstering fears about increased political violence. While DHS may not be able to prevent all external violence from impacting people in its custody, it can control the atrocious conditions within ICE detention centers that have caused the deaths of far more immigrants.

How is ICE getting away with this?

People in immigration detention have protested their inhumane treatment to raise awareness, but accountability for ICE remains minimal. For instance, a group of men at Krome staged a peaceful sit-in, while noncitizens in a California detention center staged a hunger strike protesting poor conditions. In New York, a federal judge ordered ICE to hold fewer people in the cells and allow people to shower more frequently at a Manhattan holding facility. But even with a court order, poor conditions persist. Until ICE drastically reduces the number of people it chooses to incarcerate, or elects to stop using detention as punishment, this disturbing trend is unlikely to change.

As of writing, only 17 of the 23 deaths are listed on ICE’s Detainee Death Reporting webpage. The other reports can be found wading through ICE’s news releases. But the official reports of deaths in ICE detention are not the end of the story. As previously detailed, ICE frequently seeks to release critically ill detainees prior to death, allowing them to avoid their reporting requirements. In addition, the Trump administration slashed internal accountability measures by shutting down oversight offices that oversee immigration detention. The agency’s lack of transparency and its obfuscation conceal the gravity of the inhumane treatment people face in ICE custody and allow ICE to avoid accountability.

“Every act of dehumanization sends a dangerous message to the world that human rights are negotiable.
We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government.","Following a July 24, 2025 public hearing held by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that examined widespread human rights and refugee law violations inflicted by the U.S. government, a coalition of immigrants’ rights organizations that participated in the hearing submitted a follow-up report to the Commission this week. The organizations include Al Otro Lado, Americans for Immigrant Justice, Amnesty International, the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Hope Border Institute, Human Rights First, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, the International Refugee Assistance Project, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, RAICES, and Refugees International.

The report addresses questions raised by the Commissioners during the public hearing and includes recommendations for IACHR to investigate and document the mass human rights abuses committed by the United States. Since the hearing took place, the human rights situation in the United States has only deteriorated further. The report documents worsening abuses in the immigration context including:

Disappearances of immigrants who are unfindable in government custody for prolonged periods, causing severe anguish for families and making legal representation impossible. Recently, over 1,000 people reportedly disappeared from a single detention center.

Arbitrary detention in life-threatening conditions, including in dangerous ICE jails where at least 16 people have died from January to September 2025, with reports of delayed or denied medical care leading up to some of the deaths.

Skyrocketing illegal arrests, detention, deportation, and assaults against immigrants, including families with children, U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, and people with Temporary Protected Status.

Unbearable conditions, medical neglect, and abuses in immigration jails that inflict trauma on adults and children, with one fourteen-year-old child recounting: “[b]eing here has affected my little brother a lot. He doesn’t sleep well. He cries all night. Yesterday he had an attack where he would not stop crying from 7pm to 9pm and he was outside the room crying that he didn’t want to go back in and that he wanted to be free.”

Widespread separation of immigrant parents from their babies, toddlers, and children, with reports of families seeking asylum in the United States forced to choose between being separated from their children or returning to persecution; children placed in foster care after their parents are detained; and children dragged from their beds, zip-tied, and separated from parents.

Expulsions and deportations of people to third countries where they face arbitrary imprisonment, torture, return to danger in home countries, and other rights violations. The U.S. government has carried out some of these forced removals in violation of court orders and with little to no transparency around the terms of the agreements with third countries.

Mass violations of due process protections and refugee law resulting from the government’s systematic efforts to strip people of the right to an immigration hearing regardless of how long they have lived in the United States, and to shut down asylum processing for people fleeing to the United States-Mexico border.

Attempts to conceal abuses and block legal access, including reprisals against lawyers, advocates, journalists, and government officials; the dismantling of oversight agencies; and the denial of statutorily-mandated access to detention centers for Members of Congress.

“The disappearances, mass arrests and detentions, abusive detention conditions, and other human rights violations occurring in the United States threaten all communities and undermine our Nation’s most fundamental values,” Sui Chung, Executive Director, Americans for Immigrant Justice. “We call on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the U.S. Government, and the public to shine light on these problems and take decisive action to end them. The time is now to confront these violations with transparency and urgency.”

“The Trump administration is terrorizing immigrants in the United States through mass disappearance and detention tactics that have caused family separation, increasingly concerning deaths in detention, and third country deportations to danger,” said Margaret Cargioli, directing attorney, policy and advocacy, at Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef). “We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to continue to monitor and report on the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, as well as to conduct site visits of detention facilities as people’s lives are at risk.”

“In less than a year, we have seen this administration strip noncitizens of due process rights, separate families, and deport people to countries they’ve never been to before,” said Maria Fernanda Palacios Herrera, Policy Counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP). “The international community must speak out against the widespread terror and violence inflicted upon asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrant communities by the Trump administration. We respectfully request the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights call on the United States government to cease these human rights violations immediately.”

“The cruelty inflicted on immigrants in the United States reverberates far beyond its borders,” said Taylor Koehler, Policy & Programs Staff Attorney at the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law (CHRCL). “Every act of dehumanization sends a dangerous message to the world that human rights are negotiable. As a global community, we cannot allow that precedent to take hold. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to act with urgency and use every tool within its power to protect immigrants and uphold fundamental human rights in the United States.”

“The Trump administration’s policies are sowing fear and forcing people to make terrible decisions, violently uprooting community members, separating families, disappearing people to abusive detention conditions and to countries where they are in danger or that they don’t know,” said Yael Schacher, Director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International. “We ask that the IACHR help to stop these violations of human rights by documenting harm, demanding accountability, and promoting an alternative, humane approach to migrants and asylum seekers in countries throughout the Americas.”

“Over the course of the past 10 months, the administration has continued to escalate its attacks on immigrants throughout the United States, both living in our communities and in immigration detention,” said Laura St. John, Legal Director at the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Our clients are reporting extremely alarming conditions in detention centers, more people are at risk of being removed to third countries to which they have no ties, and immigration enforcement is terrorizing our communities. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to sound the alarm on danger and violence that immigrant communities in the United States are being subjected to and ask the Commission to demand that the U.S. government immediately halt all actions that violate the human rights of immigrants in the United States.”

“My colleagues and I know the truth behind the charade. The goal is the money. The strategy is shock and awe. The tactic is terror. The tactic is violence. The tactic is torture. Sadly, this administration no longer needs to work with Central American dictators to house innocent men in mega-prisons because there’s a burgeoning one here at Ft. Bliss,” said Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center.

“This year, we have witnessed people kidnapped from their communities, separated from their children, and arbitrarily detained in deplorable conditions,” said Yannick Gill, Senior Counsel at Human Rights First. “The escalating violations of U.S. and international law deny migrants and asylum seekers their rights under the law. We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government. We urge the United States to end its systematic attacks on immigrants, the dismantling of oversight mechanisms, and retaliation against advocates who seek to shine a light on its rights abuses.”

“The U.S. government is terrorizing people, destroying their physical and mental health in horrendous detention conditions, refusing to listen to their asylum claims, retaining their personal property including original ID documents, and then sending them to Mexico,” said Gretchen Kuhner, Director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI). “Once in Mexico they have no information, no documentation, and are either dumped in the streets near the Mexico-Guatemalan border or deported to their countries of origin. In just nine months, Mexico has received over 11,000 third country nationals from the U.S., many of whom have been separated from their families. We urge the IACHR to denounce these egregious human rights violations that have stripped people of their basic dignity.”

“The United States government continues to wield its outsized and unaccountable geo-political power to enact brutal, prevention-through-deterrence migration policies—where brutality towards certain people seeking lawful protections is the point—and to strong-arm other States in the Americas to do the same,” said Erik Crew, Staff Attorney at Haitian Bridge Alliance (HBA). “These policies continue to target those who should be protected by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the American Convention on Human Rights. We urge the Commission to investigate these escalating violations and hold accountable all States in the region whose bilateral agreements empower these attacks on international human rights, refugee protections, and basic human dignity.”

“As we continue to support migrant families on the U.S. side of the border looking for their relatives in immigration detention, attending to their urgent needs for pastoral and mental health care, and arranging care for their kids in the midst of the true fear of being separated, we also accompany others stranded in Mexico due to the closure of our border to those most vulnerable. This is not just a law enforcement campaign, it’s terror,” said Jesús de la Torre, Assistant Director for Global Migration at the Hope Border Institute. “We thank the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for listening to the testimonies of all the mothers, neighbors and friends who have been brutally impacted by these policies, and we encourage the Commission to keep shedding light on these systemic abuses. The borderlands know well that, in the persistent fight for human dignity, fear never has the last word. We stand committed to uphold our welcoming identity and will continue to organize to support policies that keep families together and help our communities thrive.”",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:02:11.495698

Manhattan Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a final judgment on the matter in a 28-page order that began with a solemn reference to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

“On September 11, 2001, blocks away from this courthouse, nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in a devastating terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center. In the decades since, New York City has remained a prime target for terrorist attacks,” Kaplan wrote. “Among the City’s foremost targets are its bridges, tunnels, and subway and commuter rail systems. The subways alone have been the subject of at least eight terrorist plots since.”

State Attorney General Letitia James’ office asked the courts to require FEMA, a component of the Department of Homeland Security, to grant New York $33.8 million for anti-terrorism protections through its Transit Security Grant Program and not give it to other, less at-risk applicants, upon learning the Trump administration was going to cut the funding on Sept. 30, the eve of the new federal fiscal year.

FEMA cut the funding because New York City’s sanctuary protections for undocumented immigrants do not align with the Trump administration’s hard-line policies on immigration. The decision was not based on the likelihood of the city facing another terrorist attack, as Congress intended.

“Here, Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds. To the contrary, Congress prohibited DHS from imposing such terms by requiring the selection of grant recipients to be ‘based solely on risk,’” Kaplan wrote Thursday.

Lawyers for the federal government had argued that the money at issue had lapsed by the time the AG’s office sought the court’s intervention and had already been fully obligated to other recipients, that there was no evidence the decision-making behind withholding the funds was arbitrary and capricious, or that the cuts would cause irreparable harm.

Since the TSG program was established in the years following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the MTA has received millions of dollars annually to protect its transportation infrastructure from terrorist attacks, including with technologies that can detect weapons of mass destruction.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch last week called the decision a “profound mistake.” She said the money had also funded canine units trained to detect explosive, chemical or radiological threats in subway stations and tunnels, the employment of undercover officers and heavy weapons teams, and the implementation of broad surveillance systems. Gov. Kathy Hochul said the supposedly law-and-order-focused Trump administration was “defunding the police.”

The White House says the new fee is necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B visa program, and to improve the job market for American workers.
Citizenship and Immigration Services estimated in 2019 that there were more than 600,000 H-1B workers in the U.S.
Fees for all H-1B employers The $100,000 fee applies both to businesses looking to hire international talent as well as non-profit research institutions.
Compete America, a coalition representing corporations, universities, research institutions, and trade associations looking to reform immigration policies for skilled workers, urged the Trump administration to reverse course.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced Thursday that it is suing the Trump administration to block the addition of a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B visas, which the Chamber argues is both unlawful and misguided.

The fee also faces a separate challenge by the American Association of University Professors and a coalition of labor unions, healthcare providers, schools, and religious organizations, which sued the administration earlier this month, arguing the new fee has “already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos.”

Both the Chamber and the AAUP lawsuits aim to block President Donald Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation modifying the H-1B program — the avenue through which many skilled workers from abroad are hired in the U.S.

Both lawsuits argue that the administration’s sudden decision to impose the extra fee — which went into effect on Sept. 21 — is unlawful under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. “The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The president cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation,” the AAUP lawsuit says.

Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the Chamber, said in a press release that the new fee would make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers to access global talent.

“The president has said he wants to educate, attract, and retain the world’s best and brightest in the U.S., and the Chamber shares that goal,” Bradley said.

The White House says the new fee is necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B visa program, and to improve the job market for American workers. “The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor,” the proclamation states. It also argues abuses of the program threaten national security by depressing wages and “discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.”

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services estimated in 2019 that there were more than 600,000 H-1B workers in the U.S. The program allows companies to hire up to 65,000 workers annually, with an additional 20,000 spots for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Non-profit research institutions, universities, and government research organizations are not subject to these caps.

Fees for all H-1B employers

The $100,000 fee applies both to businesses looking to hire international talent as well as non-profit research institutions.

Although non-profit organizations such as universities and federal labs are exempted from H-1B worker caps, the administration has given no indication that these organizations will likewise be exempt from the new fees. An analysis of federal data conducted by Inside Higher Ed suggests that U.S. colleges and universities secured approval for more than 16,000 new H-1B employees in fiscal year 2025, with 930 institutions employing at least one H-1B visa holder.

The proclamation indicates that the government may waive fees on request under a national interest clause, but these requests will be considered by the Department of Homeland Security on a case-by-case basis. The AAUP lawsuit describes this offer as “vague” with “no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.”

The AAUP lawsuit also describes the administration’s decision to set the fee at $100,000 as “arbitrary and capricious” arguing that it is “untethered from the cost of adjudicating H-1B petitions or any other petitions” — a sentiment that is echoed in the Chamber’s lawsuit. Previously, H-1B petition processing fees were typically a few thousand dollars.

“When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, universities and entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create,” AAUP wrote in a press release.

Some of AAUP’s members have already been affected by the policy change, with the group’s lawsuit citing a case where a university indefinitely paused the pursuit of an H-1B visa for a professor because of the new fee.

Meanwhile, some Republicans in Congress have made clear they do not think universities should receive special treatment when it comes to hiring foreign talent. In July, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) introduced a bill proposing to take away universities’ cap-exempt status, with a companion bill introduced in the House by Reps. Thomas Tiffany (R-WI) and Andrew Clyde (R-GA). In September, Cotton introduced a broader bill that would close other “loopholes” in the H-1B system.

“Colleges and universities shouldn’t get special treatment for bringing in woke and anti-American professors from around the world. My bill closes these loopholes that universities have abused for far too long,” Cotton said in a statement.

Wider impacts for foreign talent

Though the H-1B program is for skilled foreign workers, the new fee could also deter international students from pursuing study in the U.S., wrote Lindsay Milliken, associate director of public policy research and analysis at the American Institute of Physics, in an analysis of the visa policy change. (AIP’s research team is separate from FYI.)

“International students in the U.S. on F-1 visas are often interested in transitioning on to H-1Bs after the completion of their academic programs,” Milliken wrote. “This expense may cause international students in the physical sciences to lose their employment opportunities and research organizations to be unable to afford to hire international STEM graduates of U.S. universities.”

While media coverage of the new H-1B fees has largely focused on how it will affect big tech companies, advocacy groups focused on research and innovation are also starting to voice concern that visa program changes will hinder the ability of the U.S. to attract and retain talented people from abroad.

The review of Lebanon’s Welcoming Ordinance and Hanover’s Fair and Impartial Policing policy comes in response to two new anti-sanctuary city laws Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed in May. They ban communities from preventing local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Lebanon and Hanover policies both contain immigration-related provisions that could violate the new laws come Jan. 1, when most sections, including a clause that introduces financial penalties, take effect.

If the municipalities don’t amend or repeal their current policies — which both adopted in 2020 — they could face penalties of up to 25% of the total funding they receive from the state.

Both ordinances came in the wake of an immigration crackdown under the first Trump administration. In summer 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol conducted a high profile checkpoint on Interstate 89 in Lebanon and in a separate instance arrested 18 people without immigration documentation over the course of one weekend.

Neither Hanover nor Lebanon police have received any requests to assist federal immigration authorities in at least the past five years, Hanover Police Chief James Martin and Lebanon Police Chief Phil Roberts said Thursday.

On Wednesday night, the Lebanon City Council discussed how to amend the city’s “Welcoming Ordinance,” which bars city employees, volunteers and Lebanon police from asking about people’s immigration status or sharing information with federal immigration authorities. The Hanover Selectboard held a similar discussion last week.

“I think there are important provisions worth protecting that are not addressed in the new laws that have been passed in the state Legislature this year,” Lebanon Mayor Doug Whittlesey said Wednesday night. “It has been a hallmark of our community that we are welcoming to everyone.”

The City Council briefly discussed three options; to repeal the policy, amend the policy or leave it as is and face penalties. The council will hold a public hearing to discuss the options further next month.

Ahead of Wednesday’s meeting, Whittlesey drafted a revised version of the policy to remove any potentially problematic language. Voters approved the original ordinance by a narrow margin of 200 votes, or 9%, in 2020.

The draft policy introduces exceptions to the provisions throughout by including the phrase “to the extent required by State and Federal law.” Whittlesey said he added the language to make the policy flexible if the law continues to change.

The draft policy also dictates that Lebanon staff, volunteers and police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities if they are presented with a judicial warrant or a request under the state’s right to know law, RSA 91-A.

It preserves language that prohibits Lebanon staff, volunteers and police from offering federal immigration authorities access to city resources and adds language prohibiting Lebanon police from questioning people’s immigration statuses themselves.

As an alternative to Whittlesey’s proposal, Assistant Mayor Devin Wilkie presented a separate resolution “affirming the city’s commitment to the diversity and belonging of all of its residents and opposing discrimination.”

“While Lebanon must comply with the letter of state law, it will do so without surrendering its moral and ethical obligations to protect human rights, and without participating in or facilitating any acts of hate, fear or exclusion,” the resolution concludes.

Wilkie was on the original task force that produced the welcoming ordinance in 2020 and is one of two council representatives on the Lebanon Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Commission.

Wilkie said he is in favor of repealing the ordinance and creating a task force to write a new policy that better preserves the intent of the original. The draft amended ordinance could be “a really good framework” for a new policy, he said.

The City Council has met with legal counsel to review the documents and plans to have any other revisions reviewed by a lawyer, Wilkie said.

Councilor George Sykes floated the third option: Leaving the ordinance as is and facing a penalty from the state.

“We have to be looking at more than just those two options,” Sykes said Wednesday night.

The council scheduled a public hearing to discuss the ordinance on Wednesday, Nov. 5.

At Town Meeting this spring, Hanover voters supported updating the town’s 2020 policy by adding a provision explicitly calling on the town manager and police chief not to enter any agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

The item was brought before the town by a voter petition in response to a still ongoing immigration crackdown by the Trump Administration. President Trump also issued an executive order in April promising to crackdown on “sanctuary cities” across the country.

The policy, as written, prohibits Hanover Police from trying to determine a person’s immigration status or contacting ICE to inform them of a person’s immigration status, and outlaws biased policing.

Hanover Town Manager Robert Houseman asked a town attorney to review the policy and identify which portions of it violate state law. He presented the results of this conversation at a Selectboard meeting last week.

The changes would remove a brief clause prohibiting officers from contacting or notifying ICE “about the undocumented individual based solely on an individual’s undocumented status.”

It would also eliminate two larger sections, six and seven, which further prohibit Hanover Police from working with or sharing information with federal immigration authorities and from cooperating with an ICE detainer.

ICE detainers are when local law enforcement hold a person in custody after they are cleared for release in order to give ICE time to determine the person’s immigration status or take action against them.

Last week, the Hanover board briefly discussed the options of amending the policy or keeping it as is and facing a possible fine, but made no decisions on how to proceed.

As of August, a 25% state funding penalty would be about $75,000 for Hanover, according to numbers shared by Houseman.

“We are in no rush, the penalty will kick in in January,” Houseman told the Selectboard last week.

The Hanover Selectboard will hold a public hearing about the policy at its Nov. 3 meeting.",https://vnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f29f515b-3bd6-4c87-b865-67e7078d0241.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:57:49.055842

Wasn’t there already a 'No Kings Day'?","In the latest in a series of mass protests since President Donald Trump took office, ""No Kings"" rallies and marches will be held at more than 2,500 locations nationwide on Oct. 18.

The protests are meant as a celebration of free speech, the right to assemble and the First Amendment broadly. It is also an opportunity to push back against recent moves by Trump's administration including increased immigration enforcement, organizers say.

“This, without question, will be the single biggest day of protest in American history,"" said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, which is helping organize the rallies. “Since we last did this, people have become far more aware of what is going wrong with this administration.""

Rallies, protests and marches will be held in big cities and small towns across the country. Protesters are being urged to wear yellow.

Asked for reaction to the protests Oct. 14, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson replied “Who cares?”

Where are the events?

The biggest protests are planned for outside the Capitol in Washington, DC, Boston, New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans and Bozeman, Montana.

Most states have multiple, or even hundreds of, scheduled events.

Like other mass protests this year local activists have been urged to create their own events that reflect their community.

""It is truly a grassroots effort that depends on local leaders, that is how we've tried to design this. Literally anybody can start a No King's Day event, and we encourage it,” Levin said. “If you've got to drive more than 30 minutes or an hour, consider getting a few friends together and starting your own in your own hometown.”

Who is putting this on?

Groups organizing the No Kings protests include the ACLU, American Federation of Teachers, Common Defense, 50501, Human Rights Campaign, Indivisible, League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn, National Nurses United, Public Citizen, SEIU and United We Dream.

Why is it called 'No Kings'?

The name ""No Kings"" comes from the organizers' belief that Trump is acting like a monarch rather than the leader of a democracy.

""America has no kings, and the power belongs to the people,"" their website says.

Wasn’t there already a 'No Kings Day'?

The first ""No Kings Day"" protests on June 14 were organized to coincide with Trump’s 79th birthday and Flag Day when there was a military parade in Washington, DC, in honor of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary.

That day, there were protests in more than 1,800 communities to oppose what they saw as Trump's power grab.

Is it safe to go?

Congressional Republicans have claimed that the protests will be full of ""antifa"" and are ""hate-America"" rallies.

At a press conference Oct. 10, House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota accused Democrats of keeping the government closed at the request of activists.

“This is about one thing and one thing alone ‒ to score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold … a hate America rally in DC next week,"" Emmer said.

Rally organizers told USA TODAY they expect the crowds to peacefully celebrate their First Amendment right to protest. Local organizers were required to undergo crowd safety and deescalation training.

""We are taking to the streets to exercise our First Amendment rights and speak out. We are not planning anything in any way that could be misconstrued as violence. And we are working hard to protect people, providing lots of training and preparation and creating systems and mechanisms to make sure that people who turn out are safe,"" Gilbert said.

Protests led by these same organizers over the past year, including the June 14 rally, have been peaceful.

The SSHD is accused of having an unlawful policy of only issuing proof of lawful status through eVisas, and failing to issue alternative proof of status outside of this system.

Background

On 1 January 2025, the UK Government implemented eVisas – a digital-only record of immigration status for millions of people. Since then, an eVisa is the only means by which many can prove their lawful residence in the UK and evidence their linked rights and entitlements. Previously, immigration status was verified through physical documents, such as Biometric Residence Permits.

While the Government has presented the digitalisation of immigration status as a move toward efficiency and modernisation, the eVisa system has been fraught with technical and administrative failures. Examples of the failures include individuals being unable to access their eVisa, while others have found their digital status contains inaccurate or outdated information regarding their personal details and or immigration status. These issues have often resulted in severe consequences including individuals being prevented from returning to the UK, losing employment offers, being unable to rent, facing homelessness and being denied access public funds.

While the Home Office has a number of what it refers to as ‘work arounds’ including ways for landlords, employers and others to verify immigration status using the system and provides ways to report eVisa issues so that they can be fixed, including an online form, a webchat function, and a helpline — these avenues are often inadequate due to issues such as delays which leaves individuals without proof of their lawful status and exposed to the full force of the hostile/compliant environment.

Our challenge

We have been instructed by a number of individuals who have found themselves without proof of their lawful status in the UK as a consequence of the issues with their eVisa accounts, and been exposed to the hostile/compliant environment. Two of our clients, BSC and JS, subsequent to the resolution of the issues with their eVisa accounts, have now been appointed as Lead Claimants in our the policy challenge which continues on significant wider public interest grounds.

In the case of BSC, a recognised refugee and survivor of trafficking, the eVisa displayed her trafficking name and date of birth. The consequences of this were wide ranging, but most significantly they were retraumatising and put her at risk of losing public funds she relied on to survive. Whilst in JS, a vulnerable adult, the eVisa incorrectly stated that she had no recourse to public funds. As a consequence, she was denied access to public funds and had to rely on limited asylum support payments for months longer she should have. In both cases, the eVisas were fixed months later after we issued the claims.

Unfortunately, our clients’ experiences are not isolated. According to recent reports gathered by the3million and the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA) reporting tool, some of the most common complaints about the eVisa system have included basic errors such as incorrect personal details, issues getting the Home Office to fix errors, and the inability to access eVisa at all[1].

Given the above, we have challenged the Home Secretary’s unlawful policy of only issuing proof of status, to around ten million individuals, through the eVisa system only and refusing to issue alternative proof of status outside this system (even when there are issues with individuals eVisa accounts).

Our challenge focuses on the fact that the statutory framework does not prevent the Home Secretary from issuing alternative proof of immigration status. In fact, the Home Secretary has discretion to do so where appropriate. Her refusal to do so is therefore arguably unlawful as it is a fetter of her discretion and irrational.

On 9 October 2025, the Cardiff Administrative Court granted us permission to proceed with the challenge on the basis that the grounds are arguable and in the public interest. This is a significant development which has taken us a step closer to hopefully establishing a much-needed safeguard in the eVisa system which will mean that individuals such as our clients are no longer left at the mercy of the eVisa system to prove their lawful immigration status in the UK.

We would like to thank the following orgs for their invaluable help in our clients’ challenge to the eVisa system: The 3Million, Citizens Advice Barnet, Citizens Advice Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole, Migrants Organise, Notre Dame Refugee Centre, Refugee Asylum Seeker & Migrant Action, Southwark Law Centre, and the Unity Project.

We will continue to advise and support individuals and organisations navigating eVisa issues. If you, or someone you support, are experiencing difficulties accessing or correcting your eVisa account our team is available to assist.

The Department of Homeland Security announced on Thursday that migrants paroled in the U.S. would face a new $1,000 immigration fee ""to institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system.""

The fee seeks to ""strengthen oversight of the immigration parole system and deter its misuse,"" the agency said in a news release.

""The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFERS TEEN MIGRANTS $2,500 TO LEAVE US VOLUNTARILY: REPORTS

""Through the implementation of this new fee, President Trump and Secretary Noem are guaranteeing that foreign nationals, who wish to stay here, have skin in the game and do not exploit the system,"" she continued. ""This immigration parole fee notice is another tool to stop the degradation of our immigration system and restore law and order to our country.""

The fees are triggered once the grant is effective, not when a parole request is filed or a travel document is received.

The $1,000 parole fee may be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. DHS said it will publish an annual notice in the Federal Register to announce any adjusted fees.

The money will be collected by Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The detrimental health effects of prolonged solitary confinement have been extensively documented, spanning everything from posttraumatic stress disorder to self-harm, higher suicide risks, and hallucinations.
I will feel the same way I did when I was in solitary confinement.”","“The worst days of my life” – that’s how “John” (a pseudonym we use to protect his identity) describes his stay in solitary confinement.

The man, a Latin American national in his twenties, said he spent six days in isolation while requiring medical care at an ICE detention facility in South Texas. Speaking in a video call from Latin America, where he currently lives, he told our team:

“I was in a place where I was alone. It was horrible. I didn’t have the right to do anything. I was allowed to go out for one hour in a very small place with a basketball hoop. It was a cell too, where I would be by myself.""

Solitary confinement – which ICE refers to as “segregation” – is the isolation of a person in a small, individual cell without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day.

Amid an intensifying immigration crackdown since President Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, human rights groups are sounding the alarm over the growing use of this practice by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – and the psychological impact on thousands of detainees.

Since Trump’s inauguration, authorities have arrested more than 220,000 people, according to data published by The Guardian. Some 59,760 were in detention as of September 22, 2025, compared with 39,700 in mid-January 2025, just before Trump took office.

Between December 2024 and the end of August 2025, the number of ICE detainees who spent at least a day in solitary confinement increased by 41%, according to an analysis by nonprofit news organisation The Marshall Project and Spanish-language network Univision. The analysis found that in August, more than 1,100 ICE detainees had spent time in solitary.

A study by Physicians for Human Rights released in September 2025 found that during the first four months of the second Trump presidency, the number of individuals placed in solitary confinement increased by an average of 6.5 per cent per month – nearly twice the average monthly increase observed from 2018 to 2023. The group noted that the trend of more frequent use of isolation by ICE had started during the Biden administration.

A ‘very small room’ with a ‘very small window’

Our Observer arrived in the US legally several years ago, but later lost his visa due to a relative’s neglect. After he was arrested by ICE in 2025, he spent three days in an ICE “hold room”, where he says he slept on the ground without a blanket in a small, overcrowded space and was denied a shower. Following this, he was transferred more than 2,000 kilometres away to the South Texas Detention facility.

From there, he recalls the ""terrible food"" and the cells holding 100 people, whose cellphones had been confiscated and had to rely on just four working phones for outside calls. But it was in solitary confinement that he claims he ""ended up losing [his] mind"".

John claims he was put in solitary confinement after he developed a painful rash, and the medical unit nurse couldn't identify it. He says he then spent a whole day in isolation without seeing a doctor.

In a call to his girlfriend, which she recorded and shared with the Observers team, John said, while sobbing, that a doctor was supposed to visit but hadn’t arrived. John said he was worried that he had been forgotten.

He was finally sent to the medical unit the following day, where he was examined and spent two days. However, he was then returned to solitary confinement, because, he says, there were too few beds in the medical unit, and people in worse condition than him. He was released from solitary five days later.

John and the other detainees referred to the solitary cells as ""el pozo"", Spanish for ""the well"". He described it as follows:

“It was a very small room: about 4 feet [1.2 metres] long and 8 feet [2.4 metres] wide. There was a toilet and a sink on top; one bed and a thin mattress; and a very, very small window. The window was above me, so I couldn't even see what was behind.

There was no space for anything. There was only a small space on the door where they were able to pass me the food.

It was just horrible. It was very, very cold. Sometimes, when I tried to sleep, I couldn't because it was too cold.”

‘They wouldn't change my clothes’

Contacted by the FRANCE 24 Observers team, ICE referred us to a directive originally issued in 2013. It indicates: “ICE shall ensure the safety, health, and welfare of detainees in segregated housing in its immigration detention facilities.” The document outlines two reasons for the use of segregation: “administrative segregation” for the safety of the detainee or other detainees and “disciplinary segregation” as punishment for “serious misconduct” following a hearing.

“At some point, the doctor went to solitary confinement and explained to me why I was there and that I was only going to be able to get out of there once I was healed. But it took me more time being there because they didn't give me medicine. The doctors only came every other day.

When you are in solitary confinement, they take everything that people may use to kill themselves. You are not allowed to have medicine. Because that place is horrible, officers are scared that people might take a lot of pills.

They wouldn't change my clothes. I spent several days in the same clothes. It was horrible.”

In a call to his girlfriend recorded just after he was sent back to solitary, he said he was receiving no medical care. He can be heard banging on the door and asking the guards to bring him medicine.

Regarding John’s allegations that he lacked adequate care during his stay, the ICE spokesperson said that without further information, the agency could not comment on his case.

‘I felt helpless’

John’s girlfriend, Lina (a pseudonym), is a Latin American national who now lives with John in his home country. She recalls the day she received his first call from solitary:

“ That day, he called me at 8am. I answered, and he said to me, ‘I need you to start recording this.’

I was desperate because he was again crying and asking me for help. And I felt helpless.

I called the centre asking them: ‘Hey, this person needs a new set of clothes.’ They would only say, ‘Oh, yeah, we're going to do it.’ And then [John] will call me, saying that he's been wearing the same clothes. He sweated for several days. His wounds were open, and he was sweating. So it made it worse.”

Just like John, dozens of detainees served one or more days in “segregation” each month at the South Texas Detention Facility in 2025, according to ICE data. In August, for instance, 129 individuals spent time in solitary. The centre has a capacity of 1,904 according to Geo Group, the company that operates the facility.

‘Inside the solitary cell is where I ended up losing my mind’

Solitary confinement also impacted John’s immigration fate:

“I was supposed to wait a few more weeks in detention because, as I came to the US with a visa, I was fighting my case [to remain in the US]. But because I was in solitary confinement, I ended up losing my mind, and I ended up requesting my bond hearing.”

A bond hearing – a court proceeding to determine if a defendant can be released from jail before trial – was scheduled while John remained in solitary confinement. His virtual presence at the hearing was granted after his girlfriend made numerous calls to both the detention centre and the court. However, his bond was denied.

That same day, he was supposed to face the first hearing of his removal proceedings. But he claims he was not allowed to attend, even virtually: “Those things started to let me down emotionally.”

Following the bond rejection, he decided to drop his efforts to stay in the US. He cited the time spent in solitary confinement as a factor in his decision to agree to be deported to his home country.

“Emotionally, I was drained. Most of the other detainees from my country decided to give up too, and in my detention centre, ICE was not letting people get out. So nobody was released from detention except if they were deported. There were people who were in that place for over a year, and I didn't want that.”

‘I have nightmares’

The United Nations has said that holding a person more than 15 days in solitary confinement constitutes torture – a threshold ICE frequently exceeds, according to the September 2025 report.

Focusing on the northeastern United States, the study found that nearly three-quarters of solitary confinement placements exceeded the 15-day limit. The report referred to the “systemic use of solitary confinement for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes, including punishing people for filing grievances; requesting basic needs like showers; sharing food; or reporting sexual assault”.

The detrimental health effects of prolonged solitary confinement have been extensively documented, spanning everything from posttraumatic stress disorder to self-harm, higher suicide risks, and hallucinations.

However, research shows that even brief periods of isolation can be detrimental to an individual's mental health.

Months after his release, John remains haunted by his stay in that cell.

“I have a lot of nightmares. Sometimes, when I lie down, I close my eyes, and then I remember solitary confinement or the detention itself. I will feel physically in that place. I try not to think about that, but sometimes it's very hard because the picture is on my mind. I will feel the same way I did when I was in solitary confinement.”",https://s.france24.com/media/display/3d639f44-aa9d-11f0-9741-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Design-sans-titre-11.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:02:19.824126

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide.
A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.
“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call.
The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.","Nearly two dozen states are suing the Trump administration over its cancellation of a $7bn grant program aimed at expanding solar energy in low-income communities, according to court papers.

In a statement on Thursday, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, announced two lawsuits by a group of states that received grants under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All program. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced the termination of the program in August. The agency said in an email that it would not comment on pending litigation.

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Some 11,000 low-income households in Arizona will see a 20% spike in energy bills after the state lost $156m for Solar for All.

The lawsuit is among dozens the country’s 23 Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration on issues ranging from suspension of federal grants to immigration and deployment of national guard troops to cities. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said in an online call.

The first complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed on Wednesday in the court of federal claims. A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.

California will lose around $250m in congressionally obligated funds for the program, Bonta said.

“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call. “In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by Donald Trump in July eliminated the source of funding for a program Zeldin termed a “boondoggle”. The president has rolled back federal support for solar and wind energy, calling the renewable resources expensive and unreliable.

Mayes said the program’s cancellation would hit disadvantaged communities, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona, which was slated to get a $25m award to bring electricity, often for the first time, to hundreds of homes using solar panels and battery storage systems.

The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.

In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, and the city of Washington DC.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75bbc39da9582cc247cabe50c239037b3152ebc4/891_0_4453_3563/master/4453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c49e1a8f7fc667d3f7231f5464312e7",N,,2025-10-17 12:04:32.804137

The Trump administration’s campaign to “end” sanctuary cities faces steep legal hurdles.
But courts move slowly, and the struggle over who is obligated to enforce immigration laws appears set to intensify quickly.","Donald J. Trump has been railing against sanctuary cities for a decade, describing them as hotbeds of crime and magnets for undocumented immigrants. Attacking them was a staple of both of his presidential campaigns. So it was hardly a surprise when he signed an executive order in April directing the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to “pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures” to force cities and states to implement federal immigration laws.

A White House news release that accompanied the executive order quoted a note that the president posted on Truth Social a few weeks earlier: “No more Sanctuary Cities!” he wrote. “They protect the Criminals, not the Victims. They are disgracing our Country, and are being mocked all over the World. Working on papers to withhold all Federal Funding for any City or State that allows these Death Traps to exist!!!”

In the six months since, we’ve learned what “enforcement measures” look like: hundreds of officers from several federal agencies swarming city centers, apprehending unauthorized migrants — and sometimes American citizens — during raids and traffic stops. In June, this drama unfolded in Los Angeles. In August, in Washington, D.C. It’s now happening in Chicago, and — pending court challenges — may happen in Portland, Ore.

More than 300 sanctuary jurisdictions exist in the United States — including those four cities and several entire states, according to the political scientists Loren Collingwood and Benjamin Gonzalez O’Brien. Some have passed laws barring city employees from asking individuals about their immigration status. Others will not honor requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people unless they are suspected of violent crimes.

The Trump administration’s campaign to “end” sanctuary cities faces steep legal hurdles. But courts move slowly, and the struggle over who is obligated to enforce immigration laws appears set to intensify quickly. On Sept. 30, when the president addressed hundreds of active-duty generals and admirals in Virginia, he suggested that the military should use American cities “as training grounds.” He poured vitriol on Democratic-led cities and said that inner cities were “a big part of war now.”

“It’s the enemy from within,” he said of civil disturbances. “And we have to handle it before it gets out of control.”

The lawsuit, ACLU of Nevada v. LVMPD, was filed on behalf of Morais-Hechavarria, an ACLU of Nevada client who remains in custody under an ICE hold despite a Nevada judge ordering his transfer to a treatment facility.

Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, condemned the agreement, stating that “LVMPD’s 287(g) agreement with ICE… forces Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work while simultaneously disregarding a lawfully issued order by a Nevada court.”

He added, “A person shouldn’t rot in a detention facility when ordered into treatment because the federal government has pressured local governments and local police into complicity with a disastrous… approach to immigration enforcement.”

Sadmira Ramic, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, emphasized the broader implications, saying, “This is not just a civil rights issue but has transformed into a human rights issue.” She argued that LVMPD’s cooperation with ICE “undermines our judicial system and creates unnecessary suffering,” reaffirming the ACLU’s commitment to ensuring that local entities cannot overstep their authority.

More than 170 US citizens were reportedly detained by immigration agents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration, according to an investigation by ProPublica that alleges several citizens were assaulted, restrained or held without timely release.

The report by the nonprofit investigative journalism organization comes after a Supreme Court decision allowing immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to consider race during enforcement operations. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, said citizens “shouldn’t be concerned,” since they would be released once their legal status was verified.

However, ProPublica claims its findings suggest otherwise.

It said that “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents,” with some held outdoors in harsh conditions or detained while pregnant. Nearly 20 of those detained were reportedly children, including two with cancer.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied any wrongdoing, stating that agents “do not racially profile or target Americans.”

But Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino was quoted as acknowledging that agents may consider appearance, saying to a reporter: “How do they look compared to, say, you?”

ProPublica cited examples such as Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a construction worker in Alabama, who said agents dismissed his real ID and detained him despite confirming his citizenship, and George Retes, a disabled veteran, who said he was held for three days after a workplace raid in California.

Many of the incidents reviewed reportedly ended without charges being filed. ProPublica said that of the over 170 identified cases, nearly 50 were dismissed or resulted in no prosecution.

Civil rights advocates expressed concern that race-based enforcement practices could affect US citizens.

“Any one of us could be next,” said Cody Wofsy of the American Civil Liberties Union.

The White House told ProPublica that “anyone who assaults law enforcement will be held accountable,” emphasizing that federal agents act “with professionalism to enforce the law and protect American communities.”

ProPublica said its data was compiled from lawsuits, court records and media reports, noting that official statistics on such detentions are not publicly available.

The report adds that large-scale enforcement sweeps have increased in several states, raising debate about oversight and citizens’ constitutional protections.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/10/17/thumbs_b_c_bbc121a7662b8e75903c54f9d7d28a9f.jpg?v=074405,N,,2025-10-17 12:04:46.496673

The Department of Homeland Security says Radule Bojovic overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015. Bojovic was set to be sworn in Thursday night as a Hanover Park police officer at the village board meeting.

DHS says Bojovic was encountered during a targeted enforcement action part of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in the Chicago area.

Federal officials also said that Hanover Park police records confirm he was approved by the pension fund board of trustees in January 2025.

Bojovic was seen in a Facebook post from the police department provided by DHS, which was taken in August after the officer graduated from the suburban law enforcement academy.

DHS released a statement on the arrest Thursday afternoon, saying in part, ""Governor J.B. Pritzker doesn't just allow violent illegal aliens to terrorize Illinois's communities, he allows illegal aliens to work as sworn police officers. Radule Bojovic violated our nation's laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years.""

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also commented on social media, saying ""ICE arrested an illegal alien working as a sworn police officer in Chicago suburb... radical sanctuary politicians have allowed criminal illegal aliens to infiltrate our school districts, communities and even police departments.""

The Village of Hanover Park shared the following statement Thursday afternoon:

""The Hanover Park Police Department hired Officer Bojovic in January 2025 in full compliance with federal and state law. Before hiring Officer Bojovic, the Village confirmed that he was legally authorized by the federal government to work in the United States. At the time of his hire, Officer Bojovic presented the Village with a Work Authorization Card, which was issued by the federal government's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The card was valid and recently renewed. We also conducted a full background check, including his criminal history with both the Illinois State Police and the FBI.

""The bottom line is that all information we received from the federal government indicated that Officer Bojovic is legally authorized to work in the United States as a police officer. Clearly, without that authorization, the Village would not have hired him. Additionally, the Village has not received any notice from any federal or state agency that his work authorization status has ever been revoked.

""Further, the Village also confirmed, based on a memorandum issued by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives on January 5, 2024, that his immigration status allows him to carry a firearm while on duty.

""Officer Radule Bojovic has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the immigration proceedings he is now facing. If he is permitted to remain in the United States and remains legally authorized to work in this country, he will be returned to full duty status.""

Private tour groups arranged by senators and House members, however, have continued in abundance.
“Snort,” she replied when she was asked at her birthday party how Congress and the White House might reach a resolution to reopen the government.","WASHINGTON — On Day 15 of the government shutdown, a U.S. senator hosted a well-attended birthday party for his bulldog.

Dozens of Hill staffers lined up inside the Capitol on Wednesday to wish Republican Sen. Jim Justice’s pup a happy birthday as she sat under a balloon arch wearing a pink and white hat. They noshed on cakes and dozens of cake pops shaped in 6-year-old Babydog’s likeness.

At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump gathered some of the richest people in the country for dinner at the White House. There were beef Wellington, butterscotch ice cream and gold-rimmed china but no mention of the government shutdown during Trump’s 37-minute-long remarks thanking his guests for their donations for a new White House ballroom.

“This is really a knockout crowd,” Trump said Wednesday evening, noting that their collective donations have exceeded the ballroom’s $250 million price tag.

And so it has been for the power brokers in Washington during a government shutdown that appears to have no end in sight. While thousands of federal workers are furloughed — or fired — and trying to stay afloat without paychecks, the ones responsible for the shutdown are literally, and figuratively, eating cake.

The business-as-usual nature for elected officials in Washington, and some of their aides, is in contrast to the experience of others in the nation’s capital, where federal offices, as well as many parks, landmarks and museums, are closed, and of many people across the country. It also solidifies what now seems to be a bygone era of government shutdowns — one when elected officials wouldn’t want to be caught anywhere near parties or other nonessential indulgences.

“Everything still seems to be the same, except it’s not. Except most of these people aren’t getting paid,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News, noting that the Senate has continued its committee hearings, constituent meetings and normal voting schedules despite the shutdown. “I don’t think that’s right. I just don’t think that’s right. And so, yeah, it’s — and it just feels different than any other shutdown.”

The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 after Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the president, couldn’t agree on a spending bill to keep it funded.

Lawmakers have since been working, to be sure. They’re delivering floor speeches blaming the opposing party for the shutdown and repeatedly casting votes on the same two resolutions to reopen the government that they know don’t have enough support. Some lawmakers have been having informal discussions about potential ways to break the logjam, but Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told NBC News on Thursday that while those talks had been “productive ... they’re done.” Members of Congress also continue to get paid, as their pay is protected under the Constitution.

But members of their staffs and the many people who keep the Capitol operating aren’t. A congressional staffer, who asked not to be named to protect their privacy, said that while Congress doesn’t seem to be in a big hurry to reopen the government, the shutdown is urgent for them and their family.

“My husband is a federal worker too, so for us, this is definitely urgent. We have a family to support,” the staffer told NBC News.

Like Congress, Trump has been busy with government business, holding an average of nearly an event a day since the shutdown began. He has traveled to the Middle East to mark a deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. He’s hosting foreign leaders. Later this month, he is scheduled to take a multiday trip to Asia for world leader summits and meetings.

Trump also went forward this week with a previously scheduled Rose Garden ceremony honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last month, on what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday. On Friday, he’ll meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss the war with Russia before he hops on a flight to Florida to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

The White House has called several aides who were initially furloughed back to work in recent days. While those staffers are working without pay, military personnel who service the presidency, such as the pilots, flight attendants and other staff members on Air Force One, are expected to continue receiving paychecks. The Defense Department shifted funding from elsewhere in its budget to ensure members of the military are paid during the shutdown.

The White House also said Thursday that federal law enforcement officers, including those from Customs and Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secret Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration, will be paid during the shutdown.

Trump, too, will continue getting his paycheck under federal law, though he has said he donates his salary.

At the same time, the White House has used the shutdown as cover to fire some federal workers. The Trump administration has already issued layoff notices to more than 4,000 government employees, though a federal judge blocked the move for now. The White House has said it plans to appeal.

If the firings are allowed to go forward, White House budget chief Russell Vought said, the total could “grow higher” and “probably end up being north of 10,000.”

Millions of tourists visit the U.S. Capitol every year, but tours are closed to the public because of the shutdown. Private tour groups arranged by senators and House members, however, have continued in abundance. Unlike in past shutdowns, cafeterias in the Capitol are open, trash is being picked up, grandfather clocks are still being wound, and some lawmakers have yet to furlough a single staff member.

Past shutdowns have led members of Congress to frantically work weekend legislative sessions and hold late-night working pizza dinners to try to end the impasses. But this time, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept his members out of Washington since the shutdown began, and senators have consistently taken three-day weekends.

Asked about the Senate’s weekend breaks, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he will continue to allow senators to go home at the end of the week until there’s actual movement in negotiations.

“If it looks like there’s productive reason for doing it, of course I’ll do it,” Thune said of keeping members in session over a weekend. “But if, you know, if it’s just no, no, no, no, no and we’re not making any headway, then I’m not sure what the point would be. But you know, I’m open to any suggestion that would help get the government back open.”

Once the government reopens, federal workers will receive back pay to cover the shutdown, whether they worked or not. But that wasn’t always the case. In 2019, Congress passed a law that guaranteed back pay to federal workers furloughed during shutdowns. That guarantee seems to have led lawmakers and the executive branch to furlough fewer staff members this time, senators said.

“I think the vibe is a little bit different this time because of the back pay guarantee,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in an interview this week.

Some Republicans, who were around for the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, said they believe that then-President Barack Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., purposefully made the Capitol complex and federal agencies less hospitable during that funding crisis, hoping the pain would lead lawmakers to end that shutdown.

“I think it was intentionally,” said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who told NBC News he hasn’t furloughed anyone on his staff for this shutdown.

Obama, he said, was focused on shutting down “as many things you can, make it as hard on everybody as you can, and Harry Reid did the same thing here in the Senate.”

And while lawmakers continue to be paid during the shutdown, Justice, R-W.Va., Babydog’s owner, said he is donating his paycheck to his state’s National Guard.

“There are people out there depending on us, and right now, it’s a dog’s mess,” Justice said in an interview Wednesday. “A government shutdown is the most ridiculous thing on the planet, and really, truly, we need to be working together and get across the finish line.”

Babydog had no better answer than the humans in the Capitol have had about when the shutdown might end.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, particularly in science and technology fields.
The new requirement would add $100,000 per new H-1B petition, representing a roughly 30- to 50-fold increase.
At the firm level, winning an H-1B lottery led to increased hiring of both immigrant and U.S.-born employees.
Implications If upheld, the $100,000 fee could reshape how U.S. employers hire and compete globally.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Trump’s new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, calling it unlawful and economically harmful. The Chamber, which represents nearly 3 million businesses, said the policy would make it “cost-prohibitive” for employers to hire the skilled foreign workers they rely on to stay competitive.

Boundless CEO Xiao Wang said the lawsuit “properly highlights that a $100,000 fee would significantly reduce participation in the program, resulting in fewer employers being able to access the highly skilled workers they need to continue to innovate and create American jobs.” He added that the policy “further tilts the balance of competition to the largest companies in the world and away from earlier-stage innovators and regional organizations.”

The Legal Challenge

Filed in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit argues that Trump’s September executive order imposing the new fee exceeds presidential authority and disrupts a visa framework established by Congress.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, particularly in science and technology fields. Employers currently pay between $2,000 and $3,600 in government fees per application. The new requirement would add $100,000 per new H-1B petition, representing a roughly 30- to 50-fold increase.

The Chamber warned that many employers “are bracing for the need to scale back or entirely walk away from the H-1B program, to the detriment of their investors, customers, and their own existing employees.”

The White House defended the policy as lawful and “a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms.” A spokesperson said the measure discourages companies from “driving down American wages” and prioritizes domestic hiring.

The administration clarified that the new fee will apply only to new H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025, beginning with the next visa lottery, and that existing visa holders are exempt.

A similar lawsuit was filed earlier this month in California by a coalition of healthcare organizations, unions, and faith-based employers, arguing that the fee unlawfully restricts access to skilled labor.

What the Research Shows

The Chamber’s lawsuit points to several studies showing how high-skilled immigration drives U.S. innovation and growth.

Between 1990 and 2010, foreign STEM workers accounted for roughly one-third to one-half of productivity growth in U.S. cities.

At the firm level, winning an H-1B lottery led to increased hiring of both immigrant and U.S.-born employees.

Research also shows that from 2000 to 2015, the growing share of foreign-born STEM professionals in the U.S. economy created an estimated $103 billion in benefits for American workers, largely through innovation-driven productivity gains. Another study found that over a 12-year period, firms with high H-1B participation grew in value about three times faster than comparable firms without such hires.

Implications

If upheld, the $100,000 fee could reshape how U.S. employers hire and compete globally.

For businesses, the fee represents an unprecedented cost increase that could push small and midsize companies out of the H-1B program entirely. Larger corporations may absorb the cost, but early-stage innovators could lose access to the international talent pipelines that fuel growth.

For immigrant professionals, the fee raises barriers to entry into the U.S. workforce at a time when global competition for skilled workers is intensifying. Advocates warn that it could shift innovation and job creation abroad, as companies turn to offshore or remote teams instead.

Ultimately, the lawsuit will test how far the White House can go in changing employment-based immigration policy without congressional approval.

IN THE NEWS

A federal appeals court ruled that the federal government is allowed to take command of Illinois National Guard troops but affirmed a ban on sending them on operational assignments. The dispute stems from “Operation Midway Blitz,” an immigration enforcement push by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that Illinois and Chicago argue exceeds federal authority. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security requested National Guard support after clashes near an ICE facility outside Chicago. The Trump Administration then approved the deployment of about 300 Illinois Guard members and 200 Texas Guard members for 60 days. While the temporary court order is in place, these troops cannot do law enforcement work.

World leaders met in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to discuss President Donald J. Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted. The plan includes provisions for a ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the Gaza Strip, and deployment of an “International Stabilisation Force.” The plan specifies a timeframe for restarting humanitarian aid, proposes a special economic zone, and outlines a strategy for short-term governance by a “Board of Peace,” headed by President Trump, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, other heads of state, and qualified Palestinian experts. The leaders of Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey joined President Trump and signed a broad memorandum outlining shared commitments for peace in the region.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that lets certain visa holders’ spouses work in the United States. The 2015 rule allows H-4 visa holders, the spouses of H-1B visa holders, to obtain work authorization if their spouse is pursuing permanent residency. Save Jobs USA, an organization representing U.S. technology workers, argued that the rule unlawfully gave work permits to non-citizens who should not be eligible under federal law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected that claim last year, citing to circuit precedent that the Immigration and Nationality Act allows DHS to authorize employment for certain nonimmigrants. By refusing to hear the appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court left the rule in place.

Most major news outlets—including the New York Times, Washington Post, and The Associated Press—reportedly say they will not sign the Pentagon’s new press-access policy ahead of a Tuesday deadline. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the policy—which requires visible badges and tighter rules such as a ban on encouraging illegal acts—saying reporting access is a “privilege.” The Pentagon Press Association reportedly said that the rules will discourage routine reporting by warning Defence Department staff not to talk to journalists without approval. So far, only One America News has reportedly signed the new policy agreement.

A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated a prior court order by reimposing immigration-related grant conditions on states. The court’s earlier order, issued in September, vacated those conditions, finding that they exceeded the agency’s statutory authority and coerced states into enforcing federal immigration policy. In the new ruling, Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island found that DHS violated that order by requiring states to assist in federal immigration enforcement to receive Federal Emergency Management Agency funding. He ordered DHS to remove all contested conditions and “Compliance with Federal Immigration Law” clauses from grant award documents and to reissue them within seven days.

A federal district court temporarily prohibited the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. Judge Susan Illston of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the request made by the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Government Employees, finding the unions would likely prove that OMB’s use of reduction-in-force procedures was illegal and beyond statutory authority. Prior to the court’s decision, OMB’s counsel stated that approximately 2,751 layoffs were anticipated across several agencies, with the most planned for the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The U.S. Department of Energy (Energy Department) approved a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to American Electric Power Transmission (AEP) to replace and upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of power lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, aiming to bolster grid reliability amid rising data center and artificial intelligence demand. The Energy Department said it was the first loan under the Energy Dominance Financing program and requires utilities to pass savings to customers. Supporters—including the Energy Department and AEP—reportedly claimed the financing would save customers money, add capacity, and create about 1,100 construction jobs. Critics pointed to the Energy Department’s recent cancellations of $7.6 billion in clean energy grants and a $4.9 billion loan for a wind and solar energy project as favoring fossil fuel upgrades.

A federal judge vacated the U.S. Department of Defense’s (Defense Department) cap on university research “indirect cost” rates. Judge Brian E. Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled for the university plaintiffs and declared the Defense Department’s 15 percent “Rate Cap Policy” was contrary to regulation, exceeded statutory authority, and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The policy directed the Defense Department to limit what portion of research grants universities can apply toward recovering administrative and facility costs. The ruling requires the Defense Department to stop enforcing the cap and to redesign its policy in line with federal rules.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

In a recent report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the ongoing struggle of the U.S. Patient and Trademark Office (USPTO) to balance speed and rigor and found that USPTO examiners still feel pushed to hit production targets over doing deeper reviews. GAO notes the agency has made changes, such as revising performance plans, but has not assessed whether those changes improve quality. GAO also flags a gap in USPTO’s quality metrics: even though each legal requirement shows 92 to 98 percent compliance, only about 84 percent of patents meet all four requirements at the same time. To close these gaps, GAO urges USPTO to set an overall patent-quality goal and add measures that capture the economic or scientific value of patents.

In a Brookings Institution essay, Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, argued that recent court decisions have grown the courts’ tax-making authority. In Loper Bright v. Raimondo, the U.S. Supreme Court ended court deference to federal agencies’ legal interpretations, making Treasury and Internal Revenue Service regulations easier to challenge, while in Moore v. United States the Court left unresolved whether Congress may tax unrealized income, Patel observed. She also noted upcoming litigation over whether Presidents may invoke emergency powers to impose broad tariffs that function like taxes. Patel contended that these decisions place courts at the center of defining taxing authority and increase uncertainty for agencies, businesses, and households.

In an article in the Yale Journal on Regulation, Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown Law School, found that Loper Bright v. Raimondo, a landmark Supreme Court ruling on administrative law, may not apply to the Clean Air Act (CAA). Loper Bright ended Chevron deference, which is judicial deference to a federal agency’s statutory interpretation. Heinzerling argued that because the decision targeted a specific section of the Administrative Procedure Act, other statutes which do not rely on that section may not actually be bound by Loper Bright. Heinzerling claimed that because the CAA “kicks out the Administrative Procedure Act in favor of an alternative framework for judicial review,” and excludes the statutory language at issue in Loper Bright, Chevron deference may still apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for the CAA. Heinzerling concluded that in spite of lack of support through statutory language, courts have incorrectly applied Loper Bright to the CAA.

In an essay in The Regulatory Review, Paul C. Light, professor emeritus at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, summarized some of the lessons learned on the federal service during the 2019 government shutdown. Light argued that the shutdown humanized federal employees and contractors, demonstrated the benefits provided by federal agencies, explored the increased risks to the public during funding lapses, and exposed issues with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Light also argued there was a “silver lining” to the shutdown—it offered an opportunity to implement bipartisan and publicly-supported reforms to “strengthen ethics in government, discipline the presidential appointments process, reduce campaign spending, improve fiscal efficiency and accountability, and streamline the bureaucracy.”",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WIR.jpeg,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:56.272381

These voices are not partisan. They are principled. Having served on the bench with fidelity to law over politics, these jurists now step forward—not to advocate for any party or agenda but to illuminate the constitutional architecture that protects liberty and equality for all.

Their reflections are rooted in experience, not ideology. Their warnings are grounded in precedent.

At a time when threats to judicial independence are growing more frequent and more brazen, The Fulcrum offers this series as a civic resource and a moral compass. We believe that understanding how our courts function and why their integrity is essential to preserving the democratic experiment our founders envisioned is crucial.

Today, Judge John S. Martin Jr, who served as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York from 1990 to 2003, answered several important questions for the Fulcrum.

Judge Martin’s distinguished legal career has spanned more than six decades. Before his judicial appointment, Judge Martin served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983, leading one of the nation’s most prominent prosecutorial offices. Earlier in his career, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief Appellate Attorney in the SDNY. He also served as an Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General from 1967 to 1969. Judge Martin additionally held positions in private practice at several prominent firms, including Debevoise & Plimpton and Schulte Roth & Zabel, and was a founding partner of Martin & Obermaier.

Following his retirement from the bench, Judge Martin remained active in legal practice, serving as an arbitrator and consultant in matters involving commercial contracts, executive compensation, insurance coverage, and construction claims—routinely handling disputes valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Judge Martin is a graduate of Manhattan College (B.A., 1957) and Columbia Law School (LL.B., 1961).

His words are a reminder that the judiciary is not a tool of power; it is a bulwark against its abuse.

Why did the framers enshrine an independent judiciary—and how does that safeguard our democracy today?

The genius of the Constitution lies in the fact that it created three separate coequal branches of the government, each with an independent responsibility. Congress was to pass laws; the president was the chief executive who would execute and enforce those laws, and the judiciary was to provide a forum for citizens and others to litigate disputes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Most important, it was for the courts to have the final say as to whether either Congress or the president had overstepped their bounds and engaged in conduct that was either contradictory to or unsupported by something in the Constitution and laws of the United States. Thus, an important function of the federal courts is to ensure that neither Congress nor the president exercise power not granted by the Constitution.

Why are retired judges speaking out now—what compels you to break tradition and raise your voice?

The current political atmosphere has given rise to both physical threats to judges and efforts to undermine the independence of the judiciary.

Those who adopted the Constitution recognized the importance of having judges who were truly independent and who would act free from any pressure to do anything other than that which the law required. For that reason, the Constitution provided that federal judges should serve for life and could only be removed by impeachment and also provided that their compensation could not be diminished.

Why is using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions a threat to constitutional balance?

The Constitution prohibits removing a federal judge from office except by impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Thus, there is no grounds for an impeachment proceeding based solely on a judge's good-faith decision in a particular case.

Even though a judge cannot be impeached for a particular decision, the commencement of such a proceeding impinges upon the independence of the judiciary for two reasons. 1) it causes the judge to have to spend time and money defending a baseless proceeding, and 2) it inflames public reaction to such a decision and thereby creates a threat that someone will seek to injure the ""offending"" judge either physically or financially.

What do you wish more Americans understood about the role of judges in preserving liberty and equality?

Because of their independence, federal judges have the freedom to decide cases solely on the merits. That gives them the ability to protect the rights of each of us from any type of prohibited discrimination or from an unwarranted criminal or civil litigation.

What moment from your time on the bench best captures the weight—or wonder—of serving justice?

For me, the most difficult and most rewarding part of my work involved sentencing individuals for violation of criminal law. It was difficult because sentencing anyone to a substantial term in prison is an awesome responsibility. Federal law requires use of a sentencing guideline system, which in many cases can result in an unjust sentence if the guideline is literally applied. However, there are cases in which a judge can impose a sentence less than that set by the guidelines if the judge can articulate the existence of some factor that was not adequately considered by the commission that set up the guidelines. I think I did my best work as a judge in several cases where I dramatically reduced the sentences the guidelines established, using this exception. I think, for example, of the case in which I reduced the sentence of the mother of three young children from 3 1/2 years to seven months, and another in which I reduced the sentence of a low-level drug dealer from 19 to 12 years. Feeling that you are doing justice to those who may not have otherwise received it is one of the greatest satisfactions you can have as a judge.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov. Ron DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement, acted on a request by ICE and took the 20-year-old to jail following a routine traffic stop for speeding - he was a passenger in the car and was coming to Florida from Georgia for work. López-Gómez was born in Georgia.

He was released after the case received widespread media coverage.

ICE’s aggressive tactics have even sparked fear among some non-Hispanic, white immigrants who are in the country legally.

For example, Katia, a white South African immigrant who is a naturalized citizen and lives in Fairfax County, Va., says ICE’s approach prompted her in recent months to always carry her U.S. passport inside her bag. (Katia is not her real name; like Claudia, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from ICE). She worries about how an ICE agent would react if they heard her speak and noticed her South African accent.

Katia, who is in her 50s, works in communications for a social justice organization. She came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became a naturalized citizen in 1994.

She says that the type of tactics ICE is currently using was common in South Africa, which had an apartheid government at the time she emigrated to the U.S. “It was common practice for (South African) authorities to pull people off the street and ship immigrants off to their home countries. I didn’t think I’d ever see that happen in the U.S.”

When she became a U.S. citizen, “Americans were so lovely to me. People I would tell would give me a hug,” she says. “Randos would congratulate me. It seemed they were touched that I would want to become an American citizen. I don’t feel that way anymore.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation program is not the first time the U.S. government has carried out a campaign to expel immigrants on a mass scale.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched “Operation Wetback” to send Mexican immigrants, including some who were American citizens, to their native country. Border Patrol officers carried out the program, which lasted several months. At the time, Border Patrol officers claimed that 1.2 million people of Mexican descent were either arrested or left the U.S. on their own, but some researchers believe that number was exaggerated, and that the true number was in the hundreds of thousands.

The federal government at some point will pay a steep price in court for the overzealous tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol, a civil rights attorney says.

""The U.S. government will face significant financial liability in court for ICE’s aggressive tactics, says Cary J. Hansel, a civil rights attorney in Baltimore. Hansel adds that civil lawsuits on behalf of those unlawfully detained by ICE, alleging ICE is violating the 14th Amendment – which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provides “equal protection under the law” in addition to prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of due process – will lead to large jury verdicts or settlements.

“There will be a tremendous price to pay for this kind of lazy and unconstitutional conduct. In a democracy that values freedom, people should not have to show their papers to prove they belong. This conduct turns the Constitution on its head.”

We start today's other headlines in Chicago.

A judge says federal immigration officers operating there will be required to wear body cameras. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said today she was a little startled by clashes like these between ICE agents and protesters from earlier this week. Tensions are running high. Federal officials say they have arrested more than 1,000 immigrants there since September, and the Trump administration is trying to send in the National Guard.

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker warned President Trump that Illinois, in his words, is not a place you can conquer and lashed out against the federal forces on the ground.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL):

Masked federal agents from ICE and CBP are on the ground terrorizing our communities with tear gas and rubber bullets. And some are wearing camouflage uniforms that could easily be mistaken for the military.

Geoff Bennett:

In response to the judge's order, an attorney for the Justice Department blamed the anger over the unrest in Chicago on — quote — ""one-sided and selectively edited media reports."" He added that it's not possible to get body cameras for ICE agents right away.

President Trump says he will meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Budapest to discuss ways to end the war in Ukraine, though he did not say when. Mr. Trump announced the plan on social media following a two-hour call between the two leaders that he described as very productive.

But, first, President Trump will host Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House tomorrow. Zelenskyy is pushing the president to sell Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which would enable Kyiv to strike deep into Russia. Meantime, Ukraine's energy operator announced nationwide power cuts today after Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike overnight.

On Capitol Hill today, the Senate failed to pass a measure to reopen the government for a 10th time. And in a separate vote, lawmakers also voted down an effort to fund the Defense Department for one year. Senate Majority Leader John Thune railed against Democrats on the Senate floor afterwards.

Sen. John Thune (R-SD):

This is politics. If anything was needed to demonstrate just how fundamentally uninterested Democrats are in supporting our troops and defending our country, just take a look at this vote.

Geoff Bennett:

The 50-44 vote marked the first attempt to restart partial funding, even as the stalemate continues over reopening the government as a whole. The Senate stands adjourned until next Monday, ensuring that the shutdown will stretch into next week.

President Trump announced a deal today with drugmaker EMD Serono to cut the cost of a common fertility medication related to in vitro fertilization treatments, or IVF.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: The initiatives I have just announced are the boldest and most significant actions ever taken by any president to bring the miracle of life into more American homes.

Geoff Bennett:

The president also announced guidance that would encourage employers to offer fertility coverage separate from their regular medical insurance, much like dental and vision plans. It's unclear whether employers will indeed choose to offer that coverage and whether the deal announced today will result in cheaper IVF treatments.

A number of states are showing progress in the nation's battle against obesity. That's according to an analysis of CDC data by the nonpartisan group Trust for America's Health. Last year, 19 states reported adult obesity rates of 35 percent or higher. That's down from 23 states the year before, and it's the first such decline in more than a decade.

But, nationwide, rates remain high, with roughly four in 10 American adults considered obese.

Nestle is slashing 16,000 jobs as part of its broader cost-cutting efforts. The maker of Nescafe, Kit Kats and other brands said today that the cuts will take place over the next two years as it battles rising costs and President Trump's tariffs.

Meantime, stocks struggled on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average lost around 300 points. The Nasdaq gave back just over 100 points. The S&P 500 also ended in negative territory.

And the final surviving member of the team that conquered Mount Everest has died. Kanchha Sherpa was part of the 1953 expedition that saw Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reach the top of the world's highest peak. Kanchha was born in 1933 in the foothills of Everest and started his mountaineering career when he was just 19.

He joined many Everest climbs over the years, but never reached the summit himself. In his later years, he warned against overcrowding on Everest and urged people to respect the famous mountain. Kanchha Sherpa was 92 years old.

And NPR's Susan Stamberg has died. As an original staff member, Stamberg, along with Linda Wertheimer, Nina Totenberg, and the late Cokie Roberts, was considered one of the founding mothers of NPR. From humble tasks like cutting tape, Stamberg rose quickly to become co-host of ""All Things Considered"" in 1972.

She was known for making connections with listeners, famously sharing her mother-in-law's recipe for cranberry sauce or cranberry relish, as she called it. Stamberg spoke with ""News Hour"" for NPR's 50th anniversary and told us about the opportunities and challenges of those early days.

Susan Stamberg, Journalist:

NPR was a start-up. So there weren't 1,000 people ahead of you in the job you were dying to get. That makes it tough for anybody, men or women, but particularly difficult for a woman.

Cameron Arnold of Dallas and Zachary Evetts of Waxahachie, Texas, were charged on Wednesday with providing support to terrorists for their alleged role in the nonfatal shooting of a police officer at an immigration detention facility. Both were arrested in July with eight others and charged with attempted murder and weapons offences.

None of the defendants has entered a plea in the case, court records show, but Arnold and Evetts are set to do so at an October 22 court hearing.

Arnold’s lawyer, Cody Cofer, said in an email he looks forward to defending his client at trial.

Evetts’s lawyer, Patrick McLain, said his client is innocent and accused prosecutors of adding the terrorism charges for political reasons.

“I have seen no evidence from the prosecutors to support any of the charges,” McLain told the news agency Reuters.

In a post on social media, Patel wrote: “First time ever: the FBI arrested Antifa-aligned anarchist violent extremists and terrorism charges have been brought for the July 4 Prairieland ICE attack in Texas,” Patel said on social media.

Arnold and Evetts were charged with supporting terrorists generally, not the legally distinct charge of supporting a terrorist organisation.

Trump and his Republican allies have accused antifa followers of fomenting political violence following the September assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and amid protests against federal immigration authorities in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon.

Trump signed an executive order in September calling antifa a “terrorist” organisation, although some national security law experts said the designation was legally questionable because antifa, short for “antifascist”, has no official leadership or organisational structure.

In an indictment filed in Texas federal court on Wednesday, prosecutors allege that Arnold and Evetts were part of an antifa “cell” that carried out a July 4 attack on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Alvarado, Texas.

There had been no mention of antifa in the original charging documents or accompanying announcement by prosecutors.

At least three people were detained in Woodburn and Salem on Oct. 15, according to Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste — Oregon's farm workers union and a Latino organization. Another post from Latinos Unidos Siempre, a Salem nonprofit led by youth, said it confirmed ICE activity in northeast Salem on Oct. 16. One person was detained after ICE waited for them to leave their home around 5 a.m., according to LUS.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request from the Statesman Journal for details about the law enforcement activity or arrests.

Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition said on Facebook that the coalition is seeing an increase in ICE activity across the state.

On Oct. 16, Innovational Law Lab filed a lawsuit on behalf of PCUN and Clear Clinic against ICE, CBP and DHS, challenging what they said is the agencies' practice of denying people in custody access to legal counsel before their transfer out of Oregon.

ICE, CBP and DHS on Oct. 15 ""launched a wave of coordinated assaults on the people of Oregon with arrests that swept through the Willamette Valley. Individuals caught up in these arrests were detained and swiftly transferred out of state,"" the complaint said.

The complaint stated that lawyers trying to meet clients at the Portland and Eugene field offices were denied access, and that attorneys in Portland observed federal officers loading people into vans with Washington state plates before driving away.

CLEAR Clinic immigration attorneys have responded, or tried to respond, to the detentions of 20 people over the past four or five months, according to the complaint.

In a court declaration, PCUN President Reyna Lopez said two young men were detained outside their apartment complex on Oct. 15 in Woodburn and a senior was detained on the street the same day.

The agents did not have a warrant and were not specifically looking for them, Lopez said.

Lopez said part of PCUN's team also witnessed agents parked around the block from Washington Elementary school in Woodburn. Lopez said the presence alarmed school officials and community members, worried about parents or children being detained at pick up or drop off.

“Federal agents are targeting schools, workplaces, and homes and spreading fear across Oregon,"" said Innovation Law Lab legal director Jordan Cunnings.

""Oregonians do not support ICE’s unlawful tactics. The Trump administration and its agents must abide by the same rules as everyone else,"" Cunnings said.

Cunnings reiterated that federal agents are blocking attorneys from meeting with detained Oregonians. She said they are asking the courts to ensure that ICE follows the law.

“Masked agents are snatching people from our communities and denying Oregonians their fundamental rights. We are suing today because our members are getting arrested and swept up by masked ICE agents in unmarked vehicles. All of the people detained still have due process rights and should be allowed to exercise them,"" added Lopez.

Innovation Law Lab asked for a temporary restraining order to pause the transfer of anyone arrested without a valid judicial warrant on or after Oct. 15 out of the state for three business days.

Attorneys with Innovation Law Lab are still awaiting a decision from U.S District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut in their motion for a reversal of an Aug. 22 ruling around the detention of a Woodburn farmworker. The 25-year-old, identified only as LJPL in court records, has been detained since Aug. 7 when he and three other farmworkers were arrested on their way to work at a Canby blueberry farm.

""I am concerned about our community,"" said state Rep. Lesly Muñoz, D-Woodburn.

Muñoz said she had not personally witnessed ICE activity but had received credible reports about federal agents in the area.

""Now is the time for Oregon to live up to our collective values — to stand with immigrant and refugee Oregonians and reaffirm that every person in our state deserves safety, dignity, and fairness,"" Muñoz said.

“We responded, and ICE agents detained an individual, and a crowd started to gather,” Cook said.
The group also released video taken by witnesses that they said showed that federal agents’ allegation against Martinez was false.
The incident in Oxnard echoes a level of aggression by federal agents seen on the streets of Chicago.
A Chicago-area mayor said ICE agents used excessive force when making arrests at a cemetery.","Video that appears to show federal immigration agents using their vehicle to ram the truck of an immigrant rights activist has sparked controversy and public outrage in the city of Oxnard, an agricultural town that has been the frequent target of immigration raids.

At the center of the controversy is a claim by federal agents that the activist was the aggressor, ramming into their vehicle.

The incident began shortly before 8 a.m. Thursday when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents notified the Oxnard Police Department that their vehicle had been rammed by a civilian’s vehicle near the intersection of 8th and A streets, according to Sgt. Martin Cook.

“We responded, and ICE agents detained an individual, and a crowd started to gather,” Cook said. “We were there to keep the peace and prevent any type of altercation with ICE or any other federal agency.”

Cook said that federal agencies took control of the investigation. He did not know if the person arrested by agents requested a police report and referred all questions to the Homeland Security Department, which oversees agencies including ICE and Customs and Border Protection.

VC Defensa, an immigrant rights group that has been documenting immigration raids in the region, said on Instagram that one of its volunteers, whom the group identified as Leo Martinez, had been arrested.

The group also released video taken by witnesses that they said showed that federal agents’ allegation against Martinez was false.

“ICE intentionally struck Leo’s truck and blocked his exit while Leo was exercising his right to observe ICE activity,” the group stated in one of its Instagram posts.

The video starts with a Jeep Cherokee with tinted windows tailing a dark gray truck before ramming the passenger door on the driver’s side. The driver of the truck then pulls into a dirt lot, where the group says Martinez was arrested.

“This shameful escalation by ICE is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate those of conscience who are standing up against Trump’s assault on immigrants,” the group said on Instagram. “We will not be deterred, and we will continue to keep our communities safe.”

The incident is the latest controversy involving federal immigration agents that has not only sparked outrage among activists and residents but also raised questions about some of the claims agents made previously.

Two months ago, federal immigration officers stopped Francisco Longoria in San Bernardino. During the encounter, Longoria, who was in his truck with his 18-year-old son and 23-year-old son-in-law, said he feared for their safety and drove off after masked officers shattered his car window and an officer fired several rounds at the truck.

Homeland Security officials have said officers were injured during the encounter when Longoria tried to “run them down,” prompting one officer to “discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

Attorneys for Longoria dispute that their client injured the officers or attempted to hit them and have called for an investigation of the shooting.

In June, Arturo Hermosillo was accused of ramming his van against a federal agent’s vehicle when he was instructed by the agents to move his van back to make room for an ambulance for a woman who had been injured during an immigration sweep.

Hermosillo was reversing when he said a federal agent standing near the vehicle pushed in his side view mirror, blocking his view; Hermosillo subsequently bumped into a vehicle behind him. Shortly after, agents pulled him out of the van.

Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told The Times in an email at the time that a person “rammed his vehicle into a law enforcement vehicle” during the June 19 operation

“CBP Agents were also assaulted during the operation and verbally harassed,” she said.

Videos that day did not capture any assaults; they showed residents yelling at agents.

The incident in Oxnard echoes a level of aggression by federal agents seen on the streets of Chicago.

A Chicago-area mayor said ICE agents used excessive force when making arrests at a cemetery. A pastor who was protesting at a detention center was shot in the head with a pepper ball. Troubled by the clashes between agents and the public, one federal judge is considering ordering agents to wear body cameras.

Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from The Times. In a statement to CNN, however, the department said claims that the agency is using “harsher approaches” are “smearing” federal agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”

In downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, just outside the Metropolitan Detention Center where people had gathered with signs that say “Free Leo Now!” and “ICE out of L.A.,” members of the crowd listened to Martinez as he thanked them for their support and their work.

“I knew I didn’t do anything f— wrong; that’s why they released me with pending charges,” he told the crowd. “That’s what they do with pretty much a lot of our volunteers cause we didn’t do s— wrong.

“They smashed into me,” he continued as people clapped. “And then they tried to accuse me of assaulting them, what kind of bulls— is that?”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/63062ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5173x2716+0+367/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F06%2F7d0628464c1c8c74d4d6d0eade85%2F1510124-me-dhs-press-conference-lj-5156.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 01:01:26.079228

Alderwoman Julia Ramirez of the 12th Ward says several vendors were among those detained.

The Thursday morning operation happened not far from a clash between federal agents and demonstrators near a BP gas station at West 47th Street and South Western Avenue.

Video showed multiple immigration officers wrestling a man to ground. One person appeared to be detained. The crowd then grew as federal vehicles drove off.

But, according to Bremer, Garay has legal permission to work in the U.S. through 2029, up-to-date paperwork and no criminal record.
He also has applied for political asylum, Bremer said, citing threats from the Taliban. ""
However, Bremer said ICE transferred Garay to a facility in Georgia unexpectedly, and the hearing was canceled.
Under ICE’s own policy, the agency has 48 hours to reschedule a canceled bond hearing.","As the weeks tick by, Ihsanullah Garay’s health is deteriorating inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention cell.

The 38-year-old asylum seeker and Afghan national has been battling stage II brain cancer, according to his cousin and lawyer, and was detained last month in eastern Massachusetts by federal agents after a chance encounter revealed he had an expired student visa.

Garay fell ill a couple years ago, following his doctoral studies in New York, and last winter, he moved to Lowell to be closer to his only local family member and his radiation therapy appointments at Boston Medical Center.

But to afford his medical bills and ensure he could attend doctors’ appointments, Garay needed flexible work. He started delivering food for apps like Grubhub and DoorDash.

His lawyer, Hans Bremer, told WBUR that Garay got lost while out on a delivery in Methuen on Sept. 14 and stopped to ask someone he thought was a police officer for directions. Bremer said the man turned out to be an ICE agent.

Garay, whose student visa expired in 2021 according to ICE, was arrested immediately. But, according to Bremer, Garay has legal permission to work in the U.S. through 2029, up-to-date paperwork and no criminal record. He also has applied for political asylum, Bremer said, citing threats from the Taliban.

"" He has an exceptionally strong asylum claim,” Bremer said. “He's doing everything correctly that we have always required for somebody who wants to seek asylum.”

Bremer said he “had every belief” Garay would be released from ICE custody at a bond hearing scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 16, in Chelmsford immigration court. However, Bremer said ICE transferred Garay to a facility in Georgia unexpectedly, and the hearing was canceled.

It “baffles” Bremer that Garay was detained at all, but he said that what’s more striking is that the federal government has kept someone so sick in detention.

Robin Nice, former chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association of New England, said Garay’s case reflects how the Trump administration’s immigration agenda has reshaped detention policies.

In recent months, the federal government has adopted new rules that allow agents to repeatedly relocate detainees and make it harder to get out on bond.

“ Where's the accountability?” Nice said. “Who's to say they can't transfer someone to like five different detention centers and effectively make [posting bond] impossible?”

She argued the government also can simply move detainees into jurisdictions with stricter bond standards.

""It's the government's burden [in Massachusetts] to show that someone is a flight risk or a danger to the community, but in other jurisdictions, that's not the case,” she said.

Boston ICE spokesperson James Covington said Garay will remain detained until his hearing’s outcome but did not answer questions about his medical treatment or transfer. Under ICE’s own policy, the agency has 48 hours to reschedule a canceled bond hearing. As of Thursday afternoon, it was not clear when his next hearing would take place.

When Garay entered ICE custody, he was well enough to stand. But he now uses a wheelchair, according to his lawyer.

“ He is not a flight risk. He's not a danger,” Bremer said.“There's no reason for him to be held.”

Outside the immigration system, Garay’s cousin, Abdul Ahad Storay Niazi, has been left trying to keep track of Garay’s detainment and worrying about how he is being treated.

Storay said his cousin had major brain surgery in 2022 and often suffers from seizures.

A medical document sent to immigration officials and shared with WBUR shows Garay’s doctors say he must return in the coming months to Boston Medical Center for blood tests and scans to treat and monitor his cancer.

Storay said he hasn’t heard from Garay since Saturday, a few days before he was moved down South.

“He said, ‘I have a seizure attack every day, almost every day,’ ” Storay recalled, “ ‘so please help me.’ ”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/garay_afghan_detainee-crop-1000x742.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:52.444505

The speed at which the administration was moving made it difficult to complete the assessment, Steven Cash, executive director of the Steady State, told reporters.
The Steady State assessment is echoed by democracy scholars and other analyses.
A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017.
On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54.","The United States is “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule, according to a sobering new intelligence-style assessment by former US intelligence and national security officials, who warn that democratic backsliding is accelerating under the Trump administration – and may soon become entrenched without organized resistance.

The report, titled Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline, was released on Thursday by the Steady State, a network of more than 340 former officers of the CIA, the NSA, the state department and other national security agencies.

To conduct the assessment, the authors applied the same analytic methods used by US intelligence agencies to assess the fragility of democracies abroad but turned them inward for what the group called a “first-of-its-kind” analysis of domestic democratic decline.

“We wrote it because the same tools we once used to assess foreign risks now show unmistakable warning signs at home,” the group said in a statement upon its release.

The authors conclude with “moderate to high confidence” that the US is moving toward what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections and courts continue to function, but are “systematically manipulated” to consolidate executive power and weaken checks and balances. According to the assessment, these trends are increasingly visible in the US, as part of a broader effort by Donald Trump in his second presidential term to “ensure loyalty and ideological conformity” across the federal government.

“The speed with which we have devolved away from a fully functioning democracy is startling to me,” Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst and a member of the Steady State, said on a call with reporters after the assessment was published on Thursday. “In most cases, it takes longer than nine months to get where we are.”

Since returning to the White House, the president has pardoned January 6 rioters who assaulted police, fired independent watchdogs, purged career officials viewed as disloyal, publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute political opponents, deployed troops to US cities, attacked judges who ruled against him, threatened universities and restricted press freedom – all while testing the boundaries of executive power in ways federal courts have repeatedly deemed to be unlawful and unconstitutional.

Just last week, Trump’s justice department indicted Letitia James, the New York attorney general who successfully sued him for fraud, and separately charged the former FBI director James Comey, a longtime political adversary. He has also called for jailing the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, both Democrats who opposed his deployment of federal troops there.

The speed at which the administration was moving made it difficult to complete the assessment, Steven Cash, executive director of the Steady State, told reporters. “We would finish a draft and then five things would happen,” he said, adding that the document was published as a “baseline” that could be updated with new developments.

While the report mirrors the “finished intelligence” model used by the US intelligence community, the assessment was prepared by former analysts who no longer work in government and relied entirely on open-source material such as news reports, public statements and independent watchdog analyses, as opposed to classified intelligence. Its authors also emphasize that they were not driven by politics, but by what they saw as a need for a “cold, analytic look” at how the indicators of democratic backsliding applied to the US.

“These are people who have seen these indicators develop in countries that shifted dramatically away from democracy towards authoritarianism,” Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior intelligence official who spent two decades at the NSA, told reporters on Thursday. “And we’re seeing those things happening in our country today.”

Among the key indicators of democratic decline identified in the report: the expansion of executive power through unilateral decrees and emergency authorities; the politicization of the civil service and federal law enforcement; attempts to erode judicial independence through strategic appointments and “noncompliance” with court rulings or investigations; a weakened and increasingly ineffective Congress; partisan manipulation of electoral systems and administration; and the deliberate undermining of civil society, the press and public trust.

“We judge that the primary driver of the US’s increasing authoritarianism is the increased frequency of executive branch overreach,” the assessment states. It also cites a “worrying” shift in public opinion among Americans, pointing to surveys that show a growing share who think “having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections” is a “very good or fairly good system”.

Political scientists and human rights activists have increasingly drawn comparisons between the US and countries like Hungary or Turkey, where elected leaders retained power by weakening institutional checks while preserving a democratic facade. Helt also drew a comparison to Italy under Benito Mussolini “because of the relationship between organized religion and the state”.

The Steady State assessment is echoed by democracy scholars and other analyses. A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017. On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54.

“Absent organized resistance by institutions, civil society and the public, the United States is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion, risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad,” the assessment concludes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72fee4f7a0e64df0d8620012c6bef4e69072ab45/512_0_3544_2835/master/3544.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=802095bd6b6320948eb94a2b41b53936",N,,2025-10-16 21:56:36.540016

“Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds,” wrote Kaplan in his 28-page decision.
The MTA has received the grant funds every year since 9/11.
NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the funds have helped foil eight terrorism attacks in the subway since 9/11.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Crain’s on whether it will comply with the judge’s ruling.","A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Department of Homeland Security to send the MTA $33.9 million in counterterrorism funds that the Trump administration tried to claw back.

Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York said in his ruling that DHS had overstepped its authority late last month when it attempted to revoke Transit Security Grant Program funds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on the grounds that New York has not aided the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up immigrant deportations.

“Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds,” wrote Kaplan in his 28-page decision. “To the contrary, Congress prohibited DHS from imposing such terms by requiring the selection of grant recipients to be ‘based solely on risk.’”

New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked Kaplan to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, to reinstate the grant dollars. In court papers, the Acting Deputy Administrator for Resilience at the FEMA, David Arnold, argued that the MTA had the grants pulled “because the applicant is based in New York City, a designated Sanctuary Jurisdiction city.”

But Kaplan flatly rejected that argument as “making very little sense” because the MTA’s board is appointed by the governor. “The MTA is not an instrumentality of New York City,” he wrote.

The judge’s ruling also notes that FEMA has not withheld funding from other TSGP applicants that are located in sanctuary cities, including New Jersey Transit in Newark and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority in Philadelphia. During a Thursday news conference on the ruling Gov. Kathy Hochul said the federal government's attempt to revoke the funds is purely political.

""These are punitive measures to stick it to Democratic states,"" said Hochul. ""It's a damn shame that our efforts have to be spent on playing defense instead of offense to protect our people.""

Federal officials created the TSGP in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks in Lower Manhattan and have traditionally awarded it based on the risk of terrorism agencies face.

The MTA has received the grant funds every year since 9/11. This year, $13 million of the $33.9 million the MTA expected to receive would pay for New York Police Department units to detect explosive and chemical weapons, active shooter training and counterterrorism patrols in the subway, among other things. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the funds have helped foil eight terrorism attacks in the subway since 9/11.

Trump has pointed to immigration-related protests in Chicago and other cities to justify his attempts to use the guard. But the 7th Circuit judges rejected that rationale.

A protest does not transform into a “rebellion” just because protesters are well-organized, advocate to overhaul the structure of government or use civil disobedience, Judges Ilana Rovner, David Hamilton and Amy St. Eve wrote. Nor do isolated incidents of criminality or violence convert a protest into a rebellion or generalized lawlessness, they added.

“We emphasize that the critical analysis of a ‘rebellion’ centers on the nature of the resistance to governmental authority,” the court wrote, adding that there must at least be deliberate, organized violence in opposition to government authority. “Political opposition is not rebellion.”

They would require all judgments of first-tier tribunals to be published on a government website within three days of being made, as is the case with upper tribunals.
First-tier immigration tribunals have dealt with between 38,000 and 41,000 appeals in each of the past three years, said Lord Murray.
“Allegations of bias may be rebutted, or indeed it may be found that particular judges are refusing all cases.
Labour has proposed replacing the current tribunals with a new system of “professional adjudicators” to limit the number of appeals and speed up decisions.","Sir Keir Starmer is facing a legal challenge by the House of Lords to end the secrecy over judges’ rulings on migrant deportation appeals.

Senior peers have tabled a proposed new law that would require first-tier immigration tribunals to publish their judgments on whether foreign criminals and rejected asylum seekers should be allowed to remain in Britain.

They say the public scrutiny of the decisions would “hold judges to account” and ensure they were “doing their job properly” after controversies over rulings where courts have prioritised the human rights of migrants including foreign criminals over public safety.

The Telegraph has revealed multiple cases, including a first-tier tribunal that backed an Albanian criminal’s right to stay in the UK partly because of his 10-year-old son’s distaste for eating foreign chicken nuggets. This became public only because it was overturned by an upper tribunal, which published its verdict.

‘No coherent basis for not publishing decisions’

The move comes as Labour, Reform and the Conservatives have pledged to overhaul the asylum appeals system and either quit or reform the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which has been repeatedly cited by migrants in their appeals against removal from the UK.

The amendments to change the law have been put forward by Lord Murray, a former home office minister, and are backed by the Tory party as well as the Liberal Democrats. They would require all judgments of first-tier tribunals to be published on a government website within three days of being made, as is the case with upper tribunals.

Supporters of the plan believe it could be backed by the House of Lords when it is put to a vote at the end of this month, despite opposition from the Government, which is seeking to maintain the status quo.

“There is absolutely no coherent basis for not publishing these decisions, and this is made all the worse because there is very significant public interest in this decision-making,” said Lord Murray.

Other similar courts dealing with tax, property, land and employment cases all routinely publish their decisions even though most deal with fewer cases. First-tier immigration tribunals have dealt with between 38,000 and 41,000 appeals in each of the past three years, said Lord Murray.

“Not only would it be open to a journalist or researcher to analyse the methods by which decisions are taken by the judges of the first-tier tribunal; they could analyse it by reference to the individual judge,” he said.

“Allegations of bias may be rebutted, or indeed it may be found that particular judges are refusing all cases. It does not favour one side of the argument or the other; it is simply fair and appropriate that these judgments be published.”

Other backers include Lord Faulks, a former justice minister and chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, and Lord Sandhurst, a Tory whip and former chair of the General Council of the Bar, and Lord Alton, the veteran Liberal Democrat peer.

Lord Sandhurst said: “The Human Rights Act has become a tool which forces our courts not simply to interpret UK law through the changing lens of the so-called living instrument of Strasbourg, but to change the meaning of some laws entirely.

“It is a matter of very real concern. This sort of lawfare puts our national security and sovereignty at risk. As long as these courts and tribunals exist, transparency in respect of their judgments is absolutely necessary.”

Responding to the calls for transparency for Labour, Lord Katz said the judiciary was responsible for deciding whether to publish individual judgments and the Government did not consider it necessary to legislate to change the current situation.

He said members of the public and media could still apply to the first-tier tribunal for a decision, which would be decided by the president of the immigration and asylum chamber. However, Lord Sandhurst noted that the public would be unable to make such a request if they did not know the name of the case.

The goal of the fee is to “institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system,” according to a statement from the department’s public affairs office. The fee would also improve oversight of the immigration parole system “and deter its misuse.”

“The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

“Through the implementation of this new fee, President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are guaranteeing that foreign nationals, who wish to stay here, have skin in the game and do not exploit the system,” McLaughlin continued. “This immigration parole fee notice is another tool to stop the degradation of our immigration system and restore law and order to our country.”

""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially startups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,"" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the chamber, said in a statement.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the country's largest pro-business organization, representing nearly 3 million companies. News of the group's lawsuit was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

While the chamber concedes that U.S. presidents have significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the country, Mr. Trump's Sept. 19 proclamation regarding H-1B visas exceeds his authority and ""blatantly contravenes the fees Congress has set"" for the program, the group said.

According to the lawsuit, ""The Proclamation is not only misguided policy; it is plainly unlawful.""

White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the administration's actions are ""lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step toward necessary reforms to the H-1B program.""

""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas,"" Rogers added.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The Allies of Knoxville’s Immigrant Neighbors (AKIN) is calling for the release of one of their members who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Alejandro Guizar Lozano was detained by ICE in Putnam County Jail on Wednesday while reporting for a routine appointment near Nashville. AKIN said that Lozano is an “undocumented immigrant” from Mexico. It said he was “following the process and complying with all obligations.”

6 News reached out to ICE who said that Lozano was convicted of driving under the influence and possession of methamphetamine. It said his first arrest was in Knox County in 2011, but he was not convicted of a crime until later, according to criminal records.

6 News obtained a background check through the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which said he was charged with meth possession in January 2024 and convicted in February 2025. The TBI also said he was convicted of driving under the influence in 2022. He was on probation until last week, ICE said.

“He is being held pending proceedings and recalendaring of a notice to appear,” ICE said.

“I have known Alejandro since he was 18,” said De Ann Pendry, a founding member of AKIN. “He came to the U.S. when he was about 12, and did all of his middle and high school here in Knoxville. As a young person, he helped organize young immigrants. Alejandro is such a positive person – always willing to help out – and very focused on social justice. He has a big heart.”

AKIN added that Lozano has medical needs requiring care that they were concerned he would not receive in custody. Around noon, State Representative Gloria Johnson said he had received his medicine.

“Alejandro is not a ‘violent criminal,'” Johnson said. “He is a young man who works to help people in our community access the services they need.”

They filed suit with the backing of a former lawmaker who helped pass the law directing the state’s use of the facility.

The 24-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Red Willow County District Court, argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system, are named in the case.

“Nebraska state law is clear: The governor does not have the unilateral authority to change the purpose of any public building,” said Robert McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the case. “That’s the Legislature’s job.”

Nebraska Appleseed is a nonprofit organization advocating for people in need, including immigrants.

The district court judge assigned to the case dismissed an immediate request for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.

‘Supreme executive power’

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen, said Thursday that the governor “greatly appreciates” that “prompt and well-reasoned” decision.

“We expect and believe that the lawsuit is legally and substantively without merit, and we are confident that it will receive the scrutiny it deserves in our court system,” Strimple said. “Beyond that, this office has no further comment at this time on this pending legal matter.”

Pillen and state and federal officials announced plans on Aug. 19 to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp from a state prison offering rehabilitative programming for low-risk felony offenders to a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have sought to rebrand the facility as the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Pillen, at that time, said the facility would remain state-owned and operated and be operational by mid-October. Earlier this week, he said it would instead be operational by November.

“There’s some little details, but everything’s been moving in great progress,” Pillen said Tuesday, according to reporting by KETV. “We’re really excited about it.”

Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

Spokespeople for the Nebraska Governor’s Office, Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had no immediate comment on the lawsuit Thursday.

Following the money

The lead plaintiff, DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor.

The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and since then, the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility.

As of last year, the facility had a state budget of at least $9.5 million and about 85 staff, according to September 2024 state budget documents.

Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Corrections Department has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.

The Corrections Department contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month, with at least $187,500 already spent, according to the lawsuit.

To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”

Lawyers on behalf of Schimek and the McCook residents sent a demand letter Tuesday to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, asking that the “unlawful” actions stop. The plaintiffs had threatened to sue by Wednesday if those demands were ignored or rejected.

“Without an injunction, the plaintiffs will suffer substantial, irreparable harm, which is a hardship that outweighs any hardship the defendants may face,” the lawsuit states.

While many public records requests seeking information about the state-federal plan have been denied, documents released to a government watchdog group indicated that negotiations between Nebraska and federal officials started in March or sooner, while the Legislature was still in session.

McCook residents speak out

In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.

“I am concerned about the community that I live in becoming a more toxic environment as a result of the WEC being repurposed to become an immigration detention center,” Catherine McDowell of McCook said in her affidavit.

Dale Dueland, a 49-year resident of Red Willow County, said he is an active volunteer for community and civic organizations in McCook. He said his focus has been on building McCook into a “thriving rural community.” He wrote that he worried about “irreversible damage to the economic development and community growth that I have spent my whole life working to build.”

“Specifically, I am concerned that the repurposing of the WEC to be an immigration detention center will negatively impact local businesses, home values and create reputational harm to the organizations that I have served,” Dueland continued.

Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”

Many inmates work in the community, and multiple residents said they appreciate those connections. Will Branham, a member of the McCook Arts Council, said inmates have contributed to the growth of McCook’s arts scene. Matt Sehnert said he’s spoken with men at Work Ethic Camp about career prospects and that they appreciate being seen as “valuable human beings.”

“It was clear to me that the men took great pride in working to improve our community,” Sehnert said in his affidavit.

State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, a member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, also submitted an affidavit as part of the lawsuit regarding information he had gathered from the executive branch.

The lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the state-federal plan and prevent officials from pursuing a similar plan or contract without proper legislative authority.

Such camps do exist, but they hold Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh, Sudanese refugees in Chad, and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
A prime example is what is happening to Afghan refugees in Pakistan.","The Trump administration is poised to mount a two-pronged attack on refugee resettlement. The first prong is quantitative: refugee admissions would be slashed from 125,000 in the fiscal year that just ended to 7,500. The second is qualitative: selecting who among the world’s 42.7 million refugees would be chosen for rescue.

The US refugee resettlement program historically rescued persecuted people from all racial and religious backgrounds, but according to documents obtained by the New York Times, the administration may now prioritize resettlement for “refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate.” What does that mean? Well, the only groups specifically identified are white, Afrikaner South Africans, who have already been prioritized for admission, and now, specifically, Europeans supposedly persecuted because of their “opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist’ political parties.”

In other words, the Trump administration will prioritize the immigration of people who oppose the immigration of other people. And the racial implications of these policy shifts are easily inferred.

Refugees are defined not only as people with well-founded fears of being persecuted, but also as people who have fled their countries. But have they? US officials looking for 7,500 refugees to resettle will be hard pressed to find teeming camps in Namibia overflowing with white South Africans or right-wing xenophobes from Germany huddled for safety in Swiss camps. That’s because there aren’t any.

Such camps do exist, but they hold Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh, Sudanese refugees in Chad, and Afghan refugees in Pakistan. What has stopped many countries of first arrival from forcibly returning refugees to danger has been third-country resettlement programs that relieve some of the pressure on local host states and remind them that the world is watching.

A prime example is what is happening to Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The Washington Post recently reported on Mursal, a 28-year-old Afghan woman who had a protection letter and resettlement offer from the US government. She is one among the many Afghans who the Pakistani authorities have forced back into Afghanistan since President Trump suspended resettlement. Now in hiding, she told the Post: “Everyone knows we worked with the U.S. … We fear what will happen if someone informs the Taliban’s intelligence unit.”

It’s bad enough that the refugee lifeline has been cut, but the insertion of nonrefugees into the few remaining refugee admission places adds deep insult to even deeper injury.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510usp_us_south_africa.jpg?h=a4573c9b&itok=wUPNMy0L,N,,2025-10-16 19:04:24.414009

The decision to pay ICE may prove far more controversial, given the administration’s tactics in seeking to deport people it believes to be in the United States illegally.","The Trump administration plans to pay many immigration enforcement officers during the government shutdown, drawing from funds approved as part of a recent Republican package of tax cuts.

The payments mark the latest in a string of unorthodox budget maneuvers by President Trump, who has stretched the limits of his power to advance his agenda and blunt the impact of a fiscal stalemate that is now in its third week.

Typically, many government workers are furloughed when federal funding lapses, while others in vital roles, including law enforcement, must report for duty without pay. Only after Congress strikes a deal do these employees receive their lost wages.

But Mr. Trump has looked to rearrange the budget to issue paychecks only for certain federal personnel, a set of maneuvers totaling billions of dollars that Congress has not authorized.

Employees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement received an email this week saying that “law enforcement officers are to be paid through the One Big Beautiful Bill (OB3) appropriation for the duration of the furlough period,” according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.

The bill mentioned in the message is Mr. Trump’s signature tax law, which Republicans approved this year. Along with its large tax cuts, the package allocated vast new sums to pay for the president’s mass deportations, including $31 billion for ICE to hire new agents, train them and increase enforcement.

The message, sent by agency leaders, applied to “excepted” employees, who are required to work without pay during a government shutdown.

An official at the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the plans to pay more ICE employees, and congressional aides said they believed that the payments would include a wide range of ICE workers, including investigators and deportation officers.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the payments, or how long they might last in a shutdown with no end in sight.

Broadly, the White House has also looked to provide pay for federal law enforcement during the shutdown, potentially including agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The president similarly ordered the Pentagon to rearrange its budget to pay wages to active-duty troops, and dipped into other funds for the military members of the U.S. Coast Guard.

Sara Ellis, a US district judge, who had previously required immigration agents to wear badges and banned them from using riot-control techniques such as tear gas without warning, railed on Thursday against the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) continued aggressive tactics, many of which have been caught on camera, and which appear to violate her order.

“I live in Chicago if folks haven’t noticed,” she said on Thursday. “And I’m not blind, right?”

Ellis added: “I’m getting images and seeing images on the news, in the paper, reading reports where I’m having concerns about my order being followed.”

Her new requirement of immigration officers using body cameras comes as Chicago has become the latest focal point of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign in recent weeks, with forceful federal enforcement, led by Ice but also including other agencies, and as DHS has been relying on extreme strategies against immigrants and citizens alike, in the Chicago area and elsewhere.

At the same time, locals in Chicago have been organizing to prevent arrests within their communities, while DHS has compared those efforts to “rioting” and said it “is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers”.

On Tuesday, after federal agents led a car chase and caused a multi-car collision, protesters chanted “Ice go home” and threw objects at the agents, who, seemingly without warning, threw tear gas in the direction of the protesters – and 13 Chicago police officers who were also on the scene.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, a masked agent cursed at protesters, ordering them to back away while pinning a 19-year-old, Warren King, to the sidewalk, while a witness shouted “he’s a citizen,” and it was unclear why King was under arrest, the New York Times reported.

On Sunday, when attorney Samay Gheewala tried to ask agents for a warrant as they detained an immigrant in his neighborhood, he was shoved to the ground so hard his hands bled. Agents later threw tear gas toward the crowd of protesters that had amassed.

Meanwhile, some local schoolchildren ended up obliged to stay indoors for recess after tear gas filled the streets near their playground.

Similar anecdotes have emerged across the country, even as former immigration officials warn that arrests appear to be indiscriminate and sweeping under the pressure that the Trump administration has imposed on officers to deport as many people as possible.

“They don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety,” John Sandweg, a former acting Ice director, told Politico. “They just say, ‘If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.’”

The Trump administration plans to withhold $40 million from California over its refusal to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday.

The move came weeks after an investigation found that an illegal immigrant truck driver, Harjinder Singh, killed three people after making an illegal U-turn on a Florida road in August. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.

Duffy cited failures by California to enforce English proficiency rules following one of President Donald Trump’s executive orders.

DUFFY RESPONDS WITH 'CROCODILE TEARS' COMMENT ON BANNED CALIFORNIA TRUCK DRIVER CASE

""California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America’s roads,"" Duffy said.

""The Golden State thinks it’s OK to ignore @USDOT English language requirements for truckers. You can play all the games you want, but not at the expense of American lives,"" Duffy wrote on X.

Duffy said the truck driver in the Florida crash should not have been given a commercial license because of his immigration status.

Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, told Fox News Digital that California commercial truck drivers have a lower crash rate than the national average.

""It seems the Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson about the laws of his own roads,"" Crofts-Pelayo said. ""The reality is simple: Commercial driver's license holders in California had a fatal accident rate nearly 40% LOWER than the national average. Texas, the only state with more commercial driver's license holders, has a rate nearly 50% higher than California's.""

""The facts don't lie, although for the Trump Administration, they seem optional,"" she added.

Singh, an Indian citizen, is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

Investigators said he failed an English proficiency test but was still issued a license to drive trucks. Duffy and Florida officials have blamed California as well as Washington state for issuing him a commercial driver’s license.

However, California officials said Singh had a valid work permit at the time. Authorities said he entered the United States illegally from Mexico in 2018.

October 16, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison today announced he secured a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s unprecedented demand that states turn over personal and sensitive information about millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients. Despite the Trump Administration’s claim to the contrary, this demand is likely for the purposes of immigration enforcement. Today’s preliminary injunction comes in the lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and a coalition of 22 states filed against the Trump Administration on July 29, alleging that USDA’s demand violates multiple federal laws and the U.S. Constitution and calling the scheme an “Orwellian surveillance campaign.”

“I’m gratified the court continues to find that this outrageous and unprecedented demand for the private and sensitive information of tens of millions of Americans should not be allowed to go ahead,” Attorney General Ellison said. “I’m proud to fight for hungry Americans who just want to feed their families and fight against Donald Trump’s inhumane, mass-surveillance agenda.”

SNAP is a federally funded, state-administered program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families across the country. SNAP applicants provide their private information on the understanding, backed by long-standing state and federal laws, that their information will not be used for unrelated purposes. In an attempt to bully states into compliance, USDA has repeatedly threatened to withhold administrative funding for the program if states fail to comply with its unprecedented demand for data — effectively forcing states to choose between protecting their residents’ privacy and providing critical nutrition assistance to those in need. Minnesota receives roughly $1.4 billion a year to administer the program to over 400,000 hungry Minnesotans.

In May 2025, USDA made an unprecedented demand that states turn over massive amounts of personal information on all SNAP applicants and recipients, including social security numbers and home addresses, dating back five years. Even a year’s worth of SNAP recipient data contains sensitive, personal identifying information on tens of millions of individuals — including over 400,000 in Minnesota. The federal government’s stated justifications for its unprecedented data demands, to “prevent fraud and abuse,” are directly contradicted by their own findings. Attorney General Ellison and the coalition sued to block the demand and keep the funds flowing to low-income and hungry Minnesotans.

On September 18, Attorney General Ellison and the coalition won a temporary restraining order that temporarily blocked USDA from withholding the funding. The preliminary injunction that they won, which comes after a court hearing last week, now blocks the Trump administration from withholding the funding for the duration of the coalition’s litigation.

In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it ""overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.""

""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.

A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.

Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.

The House remained on an extended break from Capitol Hill, where neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed motivated to talk to each other despite mounting repercussions from the funding lapse.

Federal courts, for example, reported just as the shutdown began Oct. 1, they could use “fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation” to keep up and running through Friday, Oct. 17.

“If the shutdown continues after Judiciary funds are exhausted, the courts will then operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers,” the announcement stated. “Under this scenario, each court and federal defender’s office would determine the staffing resources necessary to support such work.”

A spokesperson for the courts wrote in an email to States Newsroom there were no updates to offer on funding or operations as of Thursday but signaled there could potentially be an announcement Friday.

Trump spending cuts, layoffs

The shutdown has had widespread ramifications across all three branches of government, including the Trump administration’s decision to cut spending approved by Congress and lay off thousands of federal employees, though that was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week.

Federal workers who are categorized as essential will not receive their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. Furloughed employees may never receive the back pay authorized in a 2019 law if the Trump administration reinterprets it, as officials have said they might.

None of the consequences produced any real sense of urgency this week on Capitol Hill, where West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice organized a birthday party for his dog, or at the White House, where President Donald Trump held a ball for donors to his ballroom and focused on foreign policy.

Just as they have for the last several weeks, members of Congress and administration officials continued holding separate press conferences and TV news appearances, lambasting their political opponents, none of which will help move the two sides closer together to reopen government.

Failed vote No. 10

Senators failed for the 10th time to advance the stopgap government spending bill on a 51-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to move forward under the chamber’s legislative filibuster. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.

The Senate was also unable to move past a procedural hurdle on the full-year Defense Department funding bill after a 50-44 vote. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill this summer on a broadly bipartisan 26-3 vote.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that Democrats want some of the other annual appropriations bills added on to create a larger bill, though he didn’t say which of the dozen he prefers.

""It’s always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety,” Schumer said.

He added later that leaders from both political parties “have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way. Once again, they’re just going at it alone.”

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, appeared to offer a package of bills negotiated between the parties before the vote on the defense bill.

“We want this to be an open process with an opportunity to add additional bipartisan bills that address vital domestic priorities, including biomedical and scientific research and infrastructure,” Collins said. “And we want members to have a voice in the funding decisions that affect all of our states and constituents back home.”

Stopgap bills in 2025

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said during a floor speech earlier in the day the short-term government funding bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to negotiate final versions of the full-year spending bills.

“We're simply asking them to extend current funding bills for a few weeks while we work on full-year appropriations,” Thune said.

Congress is supposed to work out a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate on those bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, but hasn’t finished on time since the 1990s.

So every September, once back from their August recess, the House and Senate write a stopgap spending bill that typically keeps the lights on until mid-December.

Those short-term measures, sometimes called continuing resolutions or CRs, were traditionally negotiated among Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers until earlier this year.

House Republicans, bolstered by a sweep in last year’s elections, decided in March to write a six-month stopgap spending bill on their own, after two bipartisan short-term bills were approved earlier in the fiscal year.

Senate Democrats voiced frustration with the process but ultimately helped Republicans get past a procedural vote that required the support of at least 60 lawmakers, allowing the March stopgap to advance toward a simple majority passage vote.

House Republicans repeated their previously successful maneuver last month, writing a stopgap spending bill on their own that would fund the government through Nov. 21.

Senate Democrats, however, changed tactics and have voted repeatedly to block the House-passed stopgap bill from advancing.

Health care standoff

Democrats maintain that Republican leaders must negotiate to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.

Republican leaders have said publicly over and over that they will, but cannot guarantee Democrats a final agreement will be able to pass both chambers. They also say talks will only begin after the stopgap bill becomes law and the government reopens.

“Despite the fact we’re only in this position because of Democrats’ poor policy choices, Republicans are ready for that discussion,” Thune said. “But only once we’ve reopened the government.”

Thune also raised concerns over what message it would send for GOP leaders to negotiate during the shutdown, which he said would endorse the use of funding lapses to achieve policy or political goals.

Shutdowns in history

Republicans forced the last two government shutdowns; the first in 2013 over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the second in 2019 over Trump’s insistence lawmakers approve more funding for the border wall. Both were unsuccessful.

Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a floor speech Thursday that Republicans drafting the stopgap spending bill on their own is a stark contrast to how things have worked for years and that they can’t expect Democrats to vote for something in which they had no say.

“For the last month, the Republican leader’s favorite number has been 13. He keeps citing 13 CRs that we passed when I was majority leader. Of course we did,” Schumer said.

“What he fails to mention — I'm not sure if he forgets, or he’s deliberately trying to ignore it — is that those 13 CRs were the product of bipartisan negotiation, of serious conversation. We had to make changes in those bills when our Republican colleagues suggested it,” he added. “They were in the minority, but they had the right to be heard, a right that has been completely shut out for Democrats under this new Republican majority.”

Schumer warned Republicans about open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace beginning on Nov. 1, saying tens of millions of Americans will soon realize what congressional inaction means for their family budgets.

He said Republicans’ unwillingness to negotiate before the shutdown began or since shows they “either don’t understand it or they’re brutally callous.”

‘I want to be happy Mike’

House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a Thursday morning press conference that Republicans “have no idea” how the government shutdown will end, and blamed Democrats in the Senate for not voting to advance the stopgap bill.

House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew R. Garbarino of New York said the government shutdown is undermining the day-to-day operations of the Department of Homeland Security.

“This shutdown is making our country less safe,” he said.

Garbarino said roughly 90% of federal employees at the Department of Homeland Security are required to continue working because they have essential roles such as vetting customs at ports of entry and monitoring air space at airports.

He said those working without pay include 63,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees; more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration agents; and 8,000 Secret Service agents.

Garbarino added that he was grateful Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was using funds from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to pay the roughly 49,000 Coast Guard personnel.

In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS said it would be able to continue hiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and “deploy law enforcement across the country to make America safe again” due to funding from the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has continued its aggressive immigration crackdown.

Johnson expressed his frustration that some Homeland Security employees were working without pay.

""I am profoundly concerned about what has been happening over the last week, since I entered this order,"" Ellis said, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times.
Ellis’ order was aimed at bringing down the temperature by ensuring the immigration agents warn protesters ahead of deploying chemical weapons.
Homeland Security officials said Ellis' order was ""not constitutional"" and said some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents already used body-worn cameras.
Ellis’ ruling applies throughout the Chicago area where immigration enforcement agents have used tear gas ""without any warning or apparent justification.""","CHICAGO – A federal judge in the Northern District of Illinois ordered on Oct. 16 that immigration enforcement agents in the area will have to begin using body-worn cameras, according to local reports.

U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis gave the order in federal court in downtown Chicago following reports that immigration agents had clashes with residents on the city’s Southeast Side that ended with agents deploying tear gas and other chemical weapons. Ellis' decision comes after she issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 limiting how immigration agents used non-lethal weapons on civilians.

""I am profoundly concerned about what has been happening over the last week, since I entered this order,"" Ellis said, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times. ""I live in Chicago, if folks haven't noticed. And I'm not blind. … I tend to get news.""

The decision out of federal court comes amid President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area that the administration says is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants.

Critics say innocent people are targeted and that Homeland Security’s aggressive tactics have upended life for many people in the region.

Ellis’ order was aimed at bringing down the temperature by ensuring the immigration agents warn protesters ahead of deploying chemical weapons. However the scene that played out on the city’s Southeast Side left her with ""serious concerns.""

Photos of the scene taken by the Sun-Times and shared by the office of Gov. JB Pritzker show federal agents in fatigues pointing non-lethal weapons directly into the faces of unarmed young people protesting enforcement actions.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin has shrugged off the optics of the photos.""This is a U.S. citizen who, along with his cousin, was arrested for assaulting and throwing rocks at law enforcement. That is a 40mm launcher that fires beanbags and rubber projectiles,"" McLaughlin said in a post on X. ""But keep making this thug your poster child.""

According to local reports, Ellis ordered a top Homeland Security official to appear in court on Oct. 20 to address the issue.

Homeland Security officials said Ellis' order was ""not constitutional"" and said some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents already used body-worn cameras.

""Body-worn cameras are currently in use in ICE areas of responsibility where the agency has issued cameras and provided appropriate training,"" the statement said. ""In these areas, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy mandates the use of body-worn cameras during pre-planned enforcement actions by ICE law enforcement officers in support of the agency's mission, with limited exceptions for specific investigative operations. Agency-wide expansion of body-worn cameras is dependent on the availability of appropriated funding resources.""

An agency spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether agents in the Chicago area were using body-worn cameras.

What else does the judge’s order make ICE do?

Ellis’ order on Oct. 16 amends an order she made on Oct. 9 in response to a lawsuit brought by a group of clergy, protesters and journalists saying federal agents unreasonably deployed chemical weapons on people outside an immigration enforcement facility in the suburbs.

The immigration enforcement facility has become a hotbed of protests where agents have deployed around $100,000 worth of non-lethal weapons to stop ""rioters"" from hindering immigration enforcement, Trump administration attorney Eric Hamilton said in an Oct. 9 hearing regarding the deployment of National Guard troops to the region.

Clergy, protesters and journalists filing suit said agents fired without provocation. Among moments cited was a high-profile video of a federal agent shooting local pastor Rev. David Black in the head with a pepper ball.

Ellis in court filings said the chemical weapons use likely ""constituted excessive force"" and referred to the attack on Black as an ""unprovoked use of force.""

The original court order compels agents to wear identification, a significant step in the city where many people have chafed against masked men detaining people; and to give two warnings before using chemical weapons.

Ellis’ ruling applies throughout the Chicago area where immigration enforcement agents have used tear gas ""without any warning or apparent justification.""

""The TRO essentially directs agents and officers to follow the training they have already received on crowd control, as well as what the Constitution demands of them,"" Ellis wrote.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers.
The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted.
Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.
To get a wider sense of agents’ conduct, we cataloged all incidents we could find of citizens being held against their will by immigration officers.","When the Supreme Court recently allowed immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to take race into consideration during sweeps, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that citizens shouldn’t be concerned.

“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

But that is far from the reality many citizens have experienced. Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture. The government does not track how often immigration agents hold Americans.

So ProPublica created its own count.

We compiled and reviewed every case we could find of agents holding citizens against their will, whether during immigration raids or protests. While the tally is almost certainly incomplete, we found more than 170 such incidents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

Among the citizens detained are nearly 20 children, including two with cancer. That includes four who were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to the family’s attorney until a congresswoman intervened.

Immigration agents do have authority to detain Americans in limited circumstances. Agents can hold people whom they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally. We found more than 50 Americans who were held after agents questioned their citizenship. They were almost all Latino.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers. We compiled cases of about 130 Americans, including a dozen elected officials, accused of assaulting or impeding officers.

These cases have often wilted under scrutiny. In nearly 50 instances that we have identified so far, charges have never been filed or the cases were dismissed. Our count found a handful of citizens have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors.

Among the detentions in which allegations have not stuck, masked agent pointed a gun at, pepper sprayed and punched a young man who had filmed them searching for his relative. In another, agents knocked over and then tackled a 79-year-old car wash owner, pressing their knees into his neck and back. His lawyer said he was held for 12 hours and wasn’t given medical attention despite having broken ribs in the incident and having recently had heart surgery. In a third case, agents grabbed and handcuffed a woman on her way to work who was caught up in a chaotic raid on street vendors. In a complaint filed against the government, she described being held for more than two days, without being allowed to contact the outside world for much of that time. (The Supreme Court has ruled that two days is generally the longest federal officials can hold Americans without charges.)

In response to questions from ProPublica, the Department of Homeland Security said agents do not racially profile or target Americans. “We don’t arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” wrote spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

A top immigration official recently acknowledged agents do consider someone’s looks. “How do they look compared to, say, you?” Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino said to a white reporter in Chicago.

The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted. “Interfering with law enforcement and assaulting law enforcement is a crime and anyone, regardless of immigration status, will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson. “Officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens, and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism.”

A spokesperson for Kavanaugh did not return an emailed request for comment.

Tallying the number of Americans detained by immigration agents is inherently messy and incomplete. The government has long ignored recommendations for it to track such cases, even as the U.S. has a history of detaining and even deporting citizens, including during the Obama administration and Trump’s first term.

We compiled cases by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We did not include arrests of protesters by local police or the National Guard. Nor did we count cases in which arrests were made at a later date after a judicial process. That included cases of some people charged with serious crimes, like throwing rocks or tossing a flare to start a fire.

Experts say that Americans appear to be getting picked up more now as a result of the government doing something that it hasn’t for decades: large-scale immigration sweeps across the country, often in communities that do not want them.

In earlier administrations, deportation agents used intelligence to target specific individuals, said Scott Shuchart, a top immigration official in the Biden, Obama and first Trump administrations. “The new idea is to use those resources unintelligently” — with officers targeting communities or workplaces where undocumented immigrants may be.

When federal officers roll through communities in the way the Supreme Court permitted, the constitutional rights of both citizens and noncitizens are inevitably violated, argued David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He recently analyzed how sweeps in Los Angeles have led to racial profiling. “If the government can grab someone because he’s a certain demographic group that’s correlated with some offense category, then they can do that in any context.”

Cody Wofsy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, put it even more starkly. “Any one of us could be next.”

When Kavanaugh issued his opinion that immigration agents can consider race and other factors, the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices strongly dissented. They warned that citizens risked being “grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

Leonardo Garcia Venegas appears to have been just such a case. He was working at a construction site in coastal Alabama when he saw masked immigration agents from Homeland Security Investigations hop a fence and run by a “No trespassing” sign. Garcia Venegas recalled that they moved toward the Latino workers, ignoring the white and Black workers.

Garcia Venegas began filming after his undocumented brother asked agents for a warrant. In response, the footage shows, agents yanked his brother to the ground, shoving his face into wet concrete. Garcia Venegas kept filming until officers grabbed him too and knocked his phone to the ground.

Other co-workers filmed what happened next, as immigration agents twisted the 25-year-old’s arms. They repeatedly tried to take him to the ground while he yelled, “I’m a citizen!”

Officers pulled out his REAL ID, which Alabama only issues to those legally in the U.S. But the agents dismissed it as fake. Officers held Garcia Venegas handcuffed for more than an hour. His brother was later deported.

Garcia Venegas was so shaken that he took two weeks off of work. Soon after he returned, he was working alone inside a nearly built house listening to music on his headphones when he sensed someone watching him. A masked immigration agent was standing in the bedroom doorway.

This time, agents didn’t tackle him. But they again dismissed his REAL ID. And then they held him to check his citizenship. Garcia Venegas says agents also held two other workers who had legal status.

DHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Garcia Venegas’ detentions, or to a federal lawsuit he filed last month. The agency has previously defended the agents’ conduct, saying he “physically got in between agents and the subject” during the first incident. The footage does not show that, and Garcia Venegas was never charged with obstruction or any other crime.

Garcia Venegas’ lawyers at the nonprofit Institute for Justice hope others may join his suit. After all, the reverberations of the immigration sweeps are being felt widely. Garcia Venegas said he knows of 15 more raids on nearby construction sites, and the industry along his portion of the Gulf Coast is struggling for lack of workers.

Kavanaugh’s assurances hold little weight for Garcia Venegas. He’s a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, who speaks little English and works in construction. Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.

“If they decide they want to detain you,” he said. “You’re not going to get out of it.”

George Retes was among the citizens arrested despite immigration agents appearing to know his legal status. He also disappeared into the system for days without being able to contact anyone on the outside.

The only clue Retes’ family had at first was a brief call he managed to make on his Apple Watch with his hands handcuffed behind his back. He quickly told his wife that “ICE” had arrested him during a massive raid and protest on the marijuana farm where he worked as a security guard.

Still, Retes’ family couldn’t find him. They called every law enforcement agency they could think of. No one gave them any answers.

Eventually, they spotted a TikTok video showing Retes driving to work and slowly trying to back up as he’s caught between agents and protestors. Through the tear gas and dust, his family recognized Retes’ car and the veteran decal on his window. The full video shows a man — Retes — splayed on the ground surrounded by agents.

Retes’ family went to the farm, where local TV reporters were interviewing families who couldn’t find their loved ones.

“They broke his window, they pepper sprayed him, they grabbed him, threw him on the floor,” his sister told a reporter between sobs. “We don’t know what to do. We’re just asking to let my brother go. He didn’t do anything wrong. He’s a veteran, disabled citizen. It says it on his car.”

Retes was held for three days without being given an opportunity to make a call. His family only learned where he had been after his release. His leg had been cut from the broken glass, Retes told ProPublica, and lingering pepper spray burned his hands.He tried to soothe them by filling sandwich bags with water.

Retes recalled that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” He said one DHS official laughed at him, saying he shouldn’t have come to work that day. “They still sent me away to jail.” He added that cases like his show Kavanaugh was “wrong completely.”

DHS did not answer our questions about Retes. It did respond on X after Retes wrote an op-ed last month in the San Francisco Chronicle. An agency post asserted he was arrested for assault after he “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” Yet Retes had been released without any charges. Indeed, he says he was never told why he was arrested.

The Department of Justice has encouraged agents to arrest anyone interfering with immigration operations, twice ordering law enforcement to prioritize cases of those suspected of obstructing, interfering with or assaulting immigration officials.

But the government’s claims in those cases have often not been borne out.

Daniel Montenegro was filming a raid at a Van Nuys, California, Home Depot with other day-laborer advocates this summer when, he told ProPublica, he was tackled by several officers who injured his back.

Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw the LA raids and has since taken similar operations to cities like Sacramento and Chicago, tweeted out the names and photos of Montenegro and three others, accusing them of using homemade tire spikes to disable vehicles.

“I had no idea where that story came from,” Montenegro told ProPublica. “I didn’t find out until we were released. People were like, ‘We saw you on Twitter and the news and you guys are terrorists, you were planning to slash tires.’ I never saw those spike tire-popper things.”

Officials have not charged Montenegro or the others with any crimes. (Bovino did not respond to a request for comment, while DHS defended him in a statement to ProPublica: “Chief Bovino’s success in getting the worst of the worst out of the country speaks for itself.”)

The government’s cases are sometimes so muddied that it’s unclear why agents actually arrested a citizen.

Andrea Velez was charged with assaulting an officer after she was accidentally dropped off for work during a raid on street vendors in downtown Los Angeles. She said in a federal complaint that officers repeatedly assumed she did not speak English. Federal officers later requested access to her phone in an attempt to prove she was colluding with another citizen arrested that day, who was charged with assault. She was one of the Americans held for more than two days.

DHS did not respond to our questions about Velez, but it has previously accused her of assaulting an officer. A federal judge has dismissed the charges.

Other citizens also said officers accused them of crimes and suddenly questioned their citizenship — including a man arrested after filming Border Patrol agents break a truck window, and a pregnant woman who tried to stop officers from taking her boyfriend.

The prospects for any significant reckoning over agents’ conduct, even against citizens, are dim. The paths for suing federal agents are even more limited than they are for local police. And that’s if agents can even be identified. What’s more, the administration has gutted the office that investigates allegations of abuse by agents.

“The often-inadequate guardrails that we have for state and local government — even those guardrails are nonexistent when you’re talking about federal overreach,” said Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA School of Law.

More than 50 members of Congress have also written to the administration, demanding details about Americans who’ve been detained. One is Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat. After trying to question Noem about detained citizens, federal agents grabbed Padilla, pulled him to the ground and handcuffed him. The department later defended the agents, saying they “acted appropriately.”

How We Did This

Americans have reported a wide range of troubling encounters with immigration agents. To get a wider sense of agents’ conduct, we cataloged all incidents we could find of citizens being held against their will by immigration officers.

Critically, there is no way to know the complete scope of these stops since the government itself does not track them. But we were still able to fill in the picture a bit more.

We reviewed more than 170 cases overall, which we sorted into two categories.

The first is Americans who were held because agents questioned their citizenship. We found more than 50 such cases. The second category is Americans arrested by immigration agents after being accused of assaulting or impeding officers at protests or during immigration arrests of others. In that category, we tallied about 130 Americans, including more than a dozen elected officials. In many of these cases, the government never charged these individuals or the cases were dismissed.

We also tracked another nine citizens who reported being concerned about racial profiling after being extensively questioned by immigration officials. This includes a Mescalero Apache tribal member who was pulled out of a store and asked for his passport, and a California man who was previously deported by mistake and got another deportation order in the mail.

We did all this by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We compiled cases from the beginning of the current Trump administration through Oct. 5. Our accounting of arrests in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago is particularly limited, since the events there are still unfolding.

We did not review cases of Americans detained in airports or at the border, where even citizens are more likely to encounter increased questioning. We also did not review cases of Americans arrested at some point after alleged encounters with immigration agents since those involved a judicial process. We similarly excluded arrests of immigration protestors by local police who, unlike many of the federal agencies, booked protesters into a local jail where they could access the legal process and their families could find them.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238859233-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:03:13.032761

RAC Acceptance East, LLC issued an early federal interpretation of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA), which became law in March 2022.

In Monteiro, the court held that the EFAA can render pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class or collective action waivers unenforceable in sexual assault and sexual harassment cases even where much of the alleged misconduct occurred before the EFAA became law, so long as the dispute or claim “arises or accrues” on or after that date. Although the statute is not retroactive by its terms, the court’s application gives it practical retroactive effect in many employment cases.

What Is the EFAA?

The EFAA, a response to the #MeToo movement, amended the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class or collective action waivers in disputes related to sexual assault and sexual harassment. By its terms, the statute applies to “any dispute or claim that arises or accrues on or after [March 3, 2022].”[1] In other words, if an employee signed a pre-dispute agreement requiring arbitration or waiving joint or class proceedings, that agreement will be void and unenforceable for sexual assault or sexual harassment claims after March 3, 2022.

Case Background

The plaintiff in Monteiro, a former assistant sales manager at a rent-to-own retailer, alleged that a co-worker subjected her to repeated inappropriate and sexually suggestive remarks, physical contact, and explicit messages over the course of her employment. While many of the alleged incidents occurred prior to March 3, 2022, at least one incident and the plaintiff’s subsequent termination occurred after the EFAA’s enactment.

After reporting the harassment to management and subsequently being terminated, the plaintiff filed suit in state court alleging sexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation. However, because the plaintiff had signed a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims as part of her onboarding process, the defendants removed the case to federal court and moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the pre-dispute arbitration agreement.

Court’s Analysis

Judge Indira Talwani denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding that the EFAA applied to the plaintiff’s claims. The court emphasized that under the EFAA, claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault that accrue on or after March 3, 2022, are not subject to mandatory arbitration, even if some alleged misconduct occurred prior to that date.

Applying the “continuing violation” doctrine, the court determined that the plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim fell under the protections of the EFAA because at least one act contributing to the claim occurred after the statute’s effective date. The court further noted that the retaliation claim, based on the plaintiff’s termination, constituted a discrete act that accrued after March 3, 2022, and was therefore also subject to the EFAA.

The court rejected the defendants’ argument that the “primary allegations” of harassment predated the EFAA, holding that hostile work environment claims may span a series of acts over time, and the statute of limitations resets with each new act of harassment. As a result, the arbitration agreement was deemed invalid and unenforceable at the plaintiff’s election.

Why Monteiro Matters

Before the EFAA, employers routinely compelled arbitration of sexual harassment claims, rendering the allegations and proceedings confidential. Monteiro underscores that the EFAA’s protections turn on when a claim “arises or accrues,” not when the alleged underlying conduct occurred. Therefore, Judge Talwani’s decision substantially narrows the circumstances in which employers can rely on pre-EFAA arbitration agreements for sexual harassment disputes.

Takeaways and Next Steps

Arbitration agreements may be valuable risk-management tools, but employers should take special care to ensure these agreements are enforceable and aligned with the EFAA. Employers should review their arbitration clauses, update acknowledgment forms and dispute resolution policies to reflect the EFAA carve-out, and ensure internal training, reporting, and investigation protocols are robust to mitigate exposure.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:02:38.426440

The group led by lawyers Omer Shatz and Juan Branco filed a 700-page legal brief on Thursday. The Associated Press has obtained a copy of the brief.

Their case is based on six years of investigation, interviews with more than 70 senior European officials, minutes of high-level European Council meetings and other confidential documents. It follows a previous request to the ICC’s prosecutor’s office to investigate European officials for migration policies they argued led to the interception, detention, torture, killing and drowning of tens of thousands of people trying to reach European shores.

That request, filed in 2019 and admitted in 2020 as part of the ICC’s Libya investigation, did not cite any specific suspects by name.

Now, lawyers say they have identified dozens of European individuals, from high-level heads of state to lower-level bureaucrats, as “co-perpetrators” alongside Libyan suspects for the death of 25,000 asylum seekers and abuses against some 150,000 survivors who were “abducted and forcibly transferred to Libya, where they were detained, tortured, raped, and enslaved.”

European leaders, officials called out by name

“We did the work of the office of the prosecutor, we managed to get to the inside of this apparatus of power and deconstruct it to see which offices, which ministries and which individuals (are responsible),” Shatz said. “We feel confident to say that at least 122 are criminally liable.”

ICC’s prosecutor Karim Khan stepped aside earlier this year pending the outcome of a sexual misconduct investigation against him.

Lawyers published an online database with parts of their case and their “suspect list” naming each of the 122 individuals, their roles and why they believe the person to be liable. Among them is NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who was then prime minister of the Netherlands, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, then former president of the European Council, European former foreign policy chief Frederica Mogherini and former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri, to cite a few.

Shatz and Branco are not the only ones to have urged the ICC to investigate abuses committed against migrants in Libya and the Mediterranean Sea. In 2023, a U.N.-backed investigation also concluded the EU’s support to Libyan forces contributed to crimes against migrants and called on EU authorities to review their policies with Libya.

“The law of the ICC was born out of European crimes but only applied so far to crimes committed outside of Europe,” Shatz told the Associated Press. “Our request is simple: to apply the law impartially, also upon European nationals.”

EU says cooperation with Libya on migration still a priority

Despite repeated calls from human rights experts for Europe to refrain from supporting Libyan forces in stopping migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, European officials remain determined to continue doing just that.

Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the chaos that followed, the country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. In recent months, there has been an increase in migrant departures from eastern Libya to Greece, which European officials have been trying to address.

The EU says it has been working with Libyan authorities “to protect migrants and refugees” in Libya, “while taking action to reduce irregular departures through border management and anti-smuggling and trafficking in human beings.”

It has repeatedly defended its cooperation with Libya and its migration policy and blames migrant deaths on people smugglers and human traffickers who profit off their misery.

“The situation in Libya is critical,” EU Commission spokesperson Markus Lammert told journalists last week. “We will continue our engagement with all actors involved.”

Rival Libyan officials visit EU border agency

Just yesterday, the EU hosted both eastern and western Libyan officials for a technical visit of the bloc’s border and coast guard agency’s headquarters in Warsaw. The visit was remarkable for bringing both sides of Libya’s rival governments into the same room.

“The atmosphere was open and constructive, and the Libyan side showed real curiosity about how Frontex and the EU work,” Chris Borowski, a spokesperson for Frontex told AP in writing. “It was a good first step toward building mutual understanding.”

Human rights groups, including non-governmental organizations that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, criticized the visit. In the past few months, Libyan patrols have been caught on camera in several incidents of aggression, including shooting at both rescue ships and migrants themselves.

“With the support of the EU and its member states, the Libyan militias have turned into a brutal border force that acts with aggression and impunity at sea,” said a statement issued this week by Alarm Phone, a network of activists who operate a hotline for migrants in distress.

Questioned last week about the recent incidents at sea and the scheduled Libyan visit to Frontex, Lammert, the EU commission spokesperson, insisted border cooperation with Libya would be “in line with human rights standards.”

There was no immediate reaction to the ICC filing.

Despite answering that he was American three times, masked ICE agents armed with 'handguns and military-style rifles' continued their interrogation.
Modern day stop and frisk practice without individualized reasonable suspicion.
Justice Kavanaugh's additional factors are merely proxies for the same ethnic profiling that Brignoni-Ponce prohibited.","On Aug. 27, 2025, Rigoberto Hernandez, an Oregon firefighter, was arrested by Border Patrol agents while actively battling the Bear Gulch fire in Washington's Olympic National Forest. The arrest made national news—and occurred just 12 days before the Supreme Court would issue its Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo decision, dramatically illustrating the stark gap between legal theory and enforcement reality.

According to a habeas corpus petition filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP), a nonprofit that provides free legal representation in immigration law, Border Patrol blocked the only exit, holding 40 firefighters under armed guard. Agents were ""whistling at them like they were dogs"" and forcing them into lines. When Hernandez was held for ""nearly three more hours,"" then handcuffed on the ground and held for over four hours at the initial site of his arrest.

Transported 200 miles to a Bellingham Border Patrol station, Hernandez was denied phone calls and attorney contact for over 48 hours, then transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, where he remained until Sept. 23, 2025 — 27 days in custody.

NWIRP attorneyse successfully secured a Temporary Restraining Order that the government chose not to contest, resulting in his release on Sept. 23.

""Hernandez has been living here since he was 4! He has family members who are U.S. citizens and has a pending U.S. visa application,"" Mozhdeh Oskoulan, an attorney with NWIRP, said. ""He was released due to a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) that NWIRP filed and the government did not want to respond, so they released him.""

This detention occurred during the largest fire on the Olympic Peninsula since 1951, which as of October 2025 remained only 5% contained. Hernandez worked as a federal contractor whose specialized skills were urgently needed to protect Washington communities from this massive blaze. Yet agents made no inquiry about his community ties, flight risk, or dangerousness — despite his pending U-visa application as a crime victim. The arrest also violated DHS's own policy against enforcement during disaster response: ""Absent exigent circumstances, immigration enforcement will not be conducted at locations where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided.""

How the Supreme Court Greenlit Racial Profiling

Just 12 days after Hernandez was arrested in the middle of fighting a wildfire, on Sept. 8, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled on Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo. The Supreme Court’s decision allows ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people based solely on four specific factors: their apparent race and ethnicity, whether they speak Spanish or accented English, whether they're at worksites associated with unauthorized immigrants, or the type of work they perform (such as landscaping or construction). The Court's 6-3 decision allowed ICE to resume these racial profiling enforcement operations.

The Shadow Docket Process

Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo was decided through the Court's ""shadow docket"" — emergency orders issued without oral arguments and detailed briefings, including amicus curiae briefs (friend of the court briefs by interested parties). Shadow docket rulings prioritize speed over transparency.

The Trump administration's use of the shadow docket has been unprecedented. In the first 20 weeks of 2025, the administration filed 19 emergency applications — matching what the Biden administration filed over four years. According to Reuters, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations combined filed only eight emergency applications across 16 years. Their reporting concluded that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court has sided with Trump entirely or in part in 21 out of 24 shadow docket cases brought this year — an 87.5% success rate.

In a recent interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, confirmed that the Trump administration used the emergency docket far more frequently than previous administrations. When Colbert asked why, Justice Sotomayor explained: ""You know, success breeds new attempts, and to the extent that we have altered the natural course of history by granting more consideration of emergency dockets, of the emergency cases, we invite more of them.""

After Colbert noted the increase was ""significantly more,"" Sotomayor agreed. ""You know, in the past, the court was loath to grant emergency intervention most of the time. We figured if two courts below had given careful consideration to something, we shouldn't intrude until the case ended, which is the normal course of things. That has changed.""

ICE's Arrest Quota

NWIRP's lawsuit revealed a troubling context for Hernandez's arrest. According to their petition: ""In late May, Respondent Secretary Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller met with ICE leadership, setting a new arrest quota of 3,000 arrests per day and reportedly threatening job consequences if officials failed to meet arrest quotas.""

The petition continues: ""Following the directive from Noem and Miller, ICE agents were instructed in an email to 'turn the creativity knob up to 11' and aggressively 'push the envelope' in arrests, including by pursuing 'collaterals' — individuals who by definition would not have warrants. As another email put it: 'If it involves handcuffs on wrists, it's probably worth pursuing.'""

This focus on arrest quotas represents a dramatic departure from campaign promises. While Trump vowed to deport the ""worst of the worst"" criminals, ABC News reported in July 2025 that the reality looks very different: ""In Los Angeles, where ICE raids recently sparked large demonstrations, and in the New York City area, almost 60% of those arrested by ICE in the first ten days of June had no criminal convictions nor any pending criminal charges.""

Many of those being arrested are working people whose only immigration violation may be overstaying a visa — which is a civil infraction, not a crime.

The Constitutional Standard and the Brignoni-Ponce Precedent

Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo relied heavily on United States v. Brignoni-Ponce (1975), despite the fact that this case actually undermines his position. In Brignoni-Ponce, Border Patrol officers conducting a roving patrol near the Mexican border — not at a border checkpoint or the border itself — stopped a vehicle solely because the occupants ""appeared to be of Mexican descent."" The Supreme Court unanimously ruled this violated the Fourth Amendment, establishing that apparent Mexican ancestry alone cannot justify an immigration stop.

The Court in Brignoni-Ponce held that officers must have ""specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the country."" The Court emphasized that ""large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry"" and that ""even in the border area a relatively small proportion of them are aliens."" The Court noted that in California, approximately 20% of persons of Mexican origin were unauthorized immigrants, meaning about 80% were U.S. citizens or legal residents who would be affected by stops based solely on ethnic appearance. The Court stated, ""a set of facts cannot constitute reasonable suspicion if it 'describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent' people.""

This exact concern animated Justice Sotomayor's dissent in Noem. She emphasized the scale of innocent people who would be affected, noting: ""Never mind that nearly 47 percent of the Central District's population identifies as Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Never mind that over 37 percent of the population of Los Angeles County speaks Spanish at home, and over 55 percent speak a language other than English."" Just as Brignoni-Ponce recognized that profiling would ensnare ""large numbers"" of innocent citizens near the border, Sotomayor warned that ""countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.""

Justice Kavanaugh's Flawed Distinction

Justice Kavanaugh acknowledged constitutional limits, stating: ""To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a 'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors."" The ""salient factors"" he identified include: that there is an ""extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area;” that individuals ""tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work;” that they ""often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork;” and that ""many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.""

In Kavanaugh's view, these circumstances ""taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion"" that would allow immigration officers to ""briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status.""

However, this distinction is constitutionally meaningless. The factors Kavanaugh relies upon are no more probative of immigration status than the ethnic appearance that Brignoni-Ponce rejected. Both involve sweeping generalizations about where undocumented immigrants might be found, casting suspicion on millions of citizens and legal residents based on their appearance, language, workplace, and occupation.

David Montes, an attorney with the ACLU of Washington, explains how profoundly Kavanaugh's reasoning departs from established Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections.

Kavanaugh's concurrence suggests that immigration stops are harmless because U.S. citizens can simply prove their status and continue on their way. But this fundamentally inverts constitutional protections. Under traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine, the government cannot stop someone unless they already have reasonable suspicion based on specific facts of criminal activity. Kavanaugh's approach reverses this: the government can stop you first, and then you have an obligation to prove you're not violating the law.

""That is the radical shift from where we were before,"" Montes explains. ""Not only is it a radical shift in terms of the Fourth Amendment — the government was supposed to have information before they stopped you — but also in terms of the Fifth Amendment. I was supposed to not have to say anything to the government, right?""

Montes warns that under Kavanaugh's reasoning, exercising your Fifth Amendment right carries a penalty: ""If I don't provide information, then they can detain me for longer.""

Montes, who conducts educational presentations for the ACLU, finds this departure unprecedented: ""I mean, I've given a hundred Know Your Rights trainings at the ACLU. It's just not what the Constitution said in any context previously. It's a wild departure from what the Fourth and Fifth Amendment have previously said.""

He summarizes the reversal: ""What Kavanaugh seems to be saying is reasonable suspicion now means the police stop the person...and [that person] has to prove to them that [they] didn't commit a crime to be released. This inverts the traditional understanding where ‘reasonable suspicion’ meant that the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed a crime and therefore they could investigate further. Kavanaugh seems to put the burden on the person being stopped to prove they are not here illegally.""

Montes concludes that Kavanaugh's error is twofold: ""I think he's both wrong in terms of what constitutes reasonable suspicion and wrong in terms of what is supposed to happen after a police officer has reasonable suspicion.""

The District Court's Actual Findings

Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence repeatedly characterized ICE operations as brief stops, where individuals would be promptly released after clarifying their legal status. Yet the district court's extensive factual findings directly contradicted this portrayal. The court documented that during Operation At Large raids across Los Angeles, ""teams of armed and masked agents pulled up to car washes, tow yards, farms, and parks and began seizing individuals on sight, often before asking a single question.""

One case involved Jason Gavidia, a U.S. citizen working on his car at a tow yard. Despite answering that he was American three times, masked ICE agents armed with 'handguns and military-style rifles' continued their interrogation. When he couldn't immediately recall his birth hospital, agents 'racked a rifle' — audibly preparing the weapon to fire — 'grabbed his phone, shoved him against a fence while twisting his arm and forcing his hands behind his back.' He was released only after surrendering his REAL ID, which was never returned.

This bears no resemblance to the 'brief encounter' where citizens would be 'promptly' released that Kavanaugh described.

The Reality Behind ""Brief Detention""

Justice Kavanaugh acknowledges the Fourth Amendment's reasonable suspicion standard, noting that immigration officers ""may briefly detain"" an individual only if they have ""reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts"" of illegal presence. He assures that ""if the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.""

Yet Kavanaugh's legal standard contradicts his own factual assertions. As attorney David Montes explained, Kavanaugh allows stops based on factors — ethnicity, language, location, type of work — that describe millions of law-abiding citizens and legal residents. These are not ""specific articulable facts"" about an individual; they are broad demographic generalizations that Brignoni-Ponce explicitly prohibited.

Kavanaugh's reassurance about ""brief"" stops and ""prompt"" releases contradicts the documented reality on the ground. NWIRP attorney Mozhdeh Oskoulan challenges both Kavanaugh's legal reasoning and his factual assumptions: ""I can tell you that the idea that a brief stop for questioning is ok is ridiculous. Modern day stop and frisk practice without individualized reasonable suspicion. It is unlawful."" ""This is not what we are seeing,"" she emphasizes.

ICE Training: A Dangerous Gap in Professional Standards

ICE deportation officers previously received about 21-22 weeks of training, but The Atlantic reported in August 2025 that ""administration officials have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses."" This dramatic decrease in training helps explain the troubling incidents of violent treatment of unarmed individuals during immigration raids that are being recorded daily on cell phones.

ICE's use of masked agents in unmarked vehicles has created additional dangers for immigrant communities. The Atlantic reported that these tactics make it difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement officers and criminals posing as agents, enabling impersonators to commit crimes including kidnapping, sexual assault, and extortion. These represent only reported cases; many victims likely do not report such crimes to local law enforcement.

Justice Sotomayor's Dissent

The enforcement reality — masked agents with reduced training conducting violent stops based on ethnic appearance — is exactly what Justice Sotomayor warned the Court was authorizing in her Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo dissent.

Cutting through the legal sophistry, Justice Sotomayor stated: ""Based on the evidence before it, the court held that the Government was stopping individuals based solely on four factors: (1) their apparent race or ethnicity; (2) whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent; (3) the type of location at which they were found (such as a car wash or bus stop); and (4) the type of job they appeared to work.""

She emphasized that the District Court found these four factors, ""even when taken together, could not satisfy the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonable suspicion."" Sotomayor argued that the District Court should have been allowed to review ""these troubling allegations in the normal course,"" but the majority felt compelled to stay the order.

""That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.""

Not the Final Word

Despite the troubling implications of the shadow docket ruling, Montes emphasizes that the fight continues: ""It's worth noting that this isn't a final decision on the issue. It's just a decision on the stay... it's back down with the Central District [of California] being litigated, and so it's possible to adjust that litigation to what Kavanaugh said, and to fully flesh out those issues to show how wrong Kavanaugh was, because this isn't ultimately a decision on the merits. It's only a decision on the stay.""

Montes explains that Kavanaugh's reasoning was preliminary — essentially his ""first blush"" assessment that doesn't bind the lower court's full consideration of the constitutional issues. The case returns to the Central District of California for continued litigation, where the ACLU will continue fighting to demonstrate the flaws in Kavanaugh's analysis.

Oskoulan similarly notes: ""Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence was just one opinion out of 9. This shadow docket ruling is unclear and not the final word on the matter as the case is now sent back to lower court.""

Montes adds: ""I hope they see that when it's more fully fleshed out in front of them and not on this very quick shadow docket and reverse themselves, but if they don't, it is a massive departure from where we were before.""

Know Your Rights — And the Risks

Despite the legal setbacks, immigrant rights attorneys like those at NWIRP and the ACLU continue working to protect vulnerable communities.

""Our Know Your Rights presentations are basically to remind our immigrant communities of their Fifth Amendment right to silence and their Fourth Amendment right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures,"" Oskoulan explains. ""For example, how ICE needs a judicial warrant, or permission of the individual, to enter a house.""

However, the current reality requires acknowledging the risks involved in asserting constitutional rights.

""In this day and age when ICE breaks car windows and doors to community members' homes and drags them out and assaults them we also make sure to tell people to gauge the level of risk of physical harm they are willing to take if and when they want to exercise their constitutional rights. But to assert them verbally nonetheless,"" advises Oskoulan.

From Constitutional Theory to Enforcement Reality

If looking Mexican near the Mexico border was insufficient for reasonable suspicion in Brignoni-Ponce, then looking Latino while working on your car at a tow lot in Los Angeles cannot possibly meet that standard. Justice Kavanaugh's additional factors are merely proxies for the same ethnic profiling that Brignoni-Ponce prohibited.

The immediate impact is devastating. The Court has effectively gutted the Fourth Amendment's protection against racial profiling in immigration enforcement. The constitutional crisis became undeniable when federal agents arrested firefighter Rigoberto Hernandez while he was battling flames to protect American communities, simply because of how he looked and because he dared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right.

Yet as both Montes and Oskoulan emphasize, this shadow docket ruling is not the final word. The ACLU of California continues to litigate the case in the Central District, working to demonstrate the constitutional flaws in Kavanaugh's reasoning. Individual victories like Hernandez's release show that legal challenges can succeed. The fight for Constitutional protections continues — and communities don't have to face it alone.

""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats.","Washington — Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as ""lawless"" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.

The resolution, cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.

""This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,"" Khanna told CBS News. ""We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.""

The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.

Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.

On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was ""a little startled"" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. ""I live in Chicago,"" Ellis said. ""And I'm not blind.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has ""not seen them cross the line yet."" Johnson told reporters that ""ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,"" adding that Republicans ""stand for law enforcement.""

Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles ""fuels impersonation of immigration officers"" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who ""understand the importance of not having government overreach.""

On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. ""CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers ""are authorized to defend themselves and others"" and that DHS ""reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.""

The department has said assaults against ICE agents have risen more than 1,000% this year, though it has not released data supporting that figure.

Khanna said his resolution aims to restore public confidence while ensuring officer safety.

""I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,"" he said. ""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats. This will make sure that Americans' constitutional rights are protected and the constitutional rights of immigrants are protected.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/16/4544c990-0fe5-4e2b-b5c1-fcd7336c3dea/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4b6b8aaf863f1778030d0477fdaca40b/gettyimages-2239571287.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 19:04:40.719900

Of note: This is the first suit filed against the Trump administration this year by the Chamber.

Nonprofits like universities and hospitals also hire H-1B visa holders.
Flashback: The Chamber also sued over this issue during the first Trump administration, arguing that a ban on entry for H-1B visa holders the White House sought to impose in 2020 was illegal.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday sued to block the Trump administration's plan to charge a $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a move businesses say could deprive them of skilled foreign workers.

Why it matters: For all of the actions taken by the administration that pressured corporate America, from DOGE to tariffs, the proposed visa changes proved a bridge too far for the influential business lobby.

The big picture: Big businesses have been extremely reluctant to pursue litigation over Trump's policies, even as behind the scenes new regulations and orders are causing widespread discontent.

Trump's tariffs, for example, were challenged in court by a group of small businesses.

What they're saying: The Chamber, in a petition for an injunction, said the new fees would keep many American businesses from being able to hire talented foreign workers.

""These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America's economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States. That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back,"" the group wrote.

Of note: This is the first suit filed against the Trump administration this year by the Chamber.

The group sued the Biden White House on multiple occasions, frequently arguing the administration overstepped its statutory authority.

Catch up quick: In a September executive order, Trump said that employers hiring workers through the H-1B visa program would be subject to a $100,000 fee.

Prior to the announcement, it cost about $3,600 to sponsor a visa holder, and companies large and small said it was a crucial mechanism for hiring hard-to-find tech and science talent. Nonprofits like universities and hospitals also hire H-1B visa holders.

The announcement set off a panic inside American companies and among foreign workers.

Many small businesses and startups said they're unable to pay such a fee. Bigger companies were considering offshoring the work, lawyers told Axios recently.

Zoom in: The Chamber, which represents around 300,000 members including big and small employers, argues that the order is unlawful, and directly contradicts laws passed by Congress.

They're asking the court to stop the fee from taking effect.

The suit was filed in the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C. against the Department of Homeland Security and State Department. DHS secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are named defendants.

For the record: ""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

""The Administration's actions are lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms to the H-1B program.""

Flashback: The Chamber also sued over this issue during the first Trump administration, arguing that a ban on entry for H-1B visa holders the White House sought to impose in 2020 was illegal.

In that case, a federal judge ruled that the administration overstepped its authority.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has locked arms with fellow Democrats nationwide in using the courts to push back on President Donald Trump’s agenda.

The potential 2028 presidential candidate has filed or joined more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, challenging the president’s efforts to reshape the federal government and slash previously allocated spending. The ones he’s joined have been championed by other Democratic officials.

Under Pennsylvania law, Republican Attorney General Dave Sunday is in charge of representing the commonwealth. But Shapiro can ask Sunday in writing to allow the governor’s Office of General Counsel to take over legal representation for the governor or other executive branch officials.

If Sunday declines Shapiro’s request — which he has not done this year, according to Shapiro’s office — the general counsel can intervene in the lawsuit to represent Shapiro and his interests as the state’s chief executive anyway.

Here is a timeline of Shapiro’s lawsuits, listed in order of filing date:

Federal funding freeze, Feb. 13

One of Trump’s first actions upon reentering the White House this year was to issue a sweeping executive order freezing the distribution of billions of dollars in federal grant money, including $2.1 billion allocated to Pennsylvania largely for environmental programs.

Shapiro then sued five federal agencies over those funds in Pennsylvania’s Eastern District Court. Since the funds were released, Shapiro has touted this case as demonstrative of his success in combating the Trump administration.

On Aug. 12, Shapiro’s office voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit “(b)ecause all previously-withheld funding at issue in this case is currently available” to Pennsylvania.

The case was Shapiro v. U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 2:25-cv-00763.

Public health grants, April 1

Shapiro joined a multistate lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for their cancellation of public health grants meant to assist states in combating infectious diseases. Those funds included $500 million for the Pennsylvania departments of Human Services, Health, and Drug and Alcohol Programs.

A Rhode Island federal judge ruled in May that Kennedy’s agency must release those funds, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected Kennedy’s appeal in July. Defendants have until Oct. 28 to respond.

The case is State of Colorado et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island, No. 1:25-cv-00121.

Post-pandemic education funds, April 10

Sixteen states, including Pennsylvania (represented by Shapiro’s office), and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon over rescinded funding the agency provided to school districts after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared over.

The funding — of which $185 million was allocated to 116 Pennsylvania school districts to boost student mental health resources, support access to high-speed internet and fund HVAC installation — was reinstated by a New York federal judge in May.

The case is ongoing. In an Oct. 1 filing, Jay Clayton, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the parties “have made additional progress in reaching a consensual resolution but require additional time to finalize an agreement.”

The case is New York et al. v. U.S. Department of Education et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:25-cv-02990.

AmeriCorps, April 29

Shapiro joined more than two dozen states in suing the Corporation for National and Community Service over its cancellation of AmeriCorps, which promotes volunteerism in nonprofits, schools, faith-based organizations and public agencies.

Pennsylvania was to receive more than $6 million to support its AmeriCorps workers, and a Maryland federal judge ruled in June that the federal agency had to return those rescinded funds to the state. The case is ongoing.

The case is State of Maryland et al. v. Corporation for National and Community Service, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland, Case No. 1:25-cv-01363.

Food purchasing program, June 4

Shapiro filed a lawsuit in the Middle District of Pennsylvania demanding that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins pay over $13 million in canceled federal funding to a program for farmers who sell products to food banks.

The case is ongoing, with Rollins’ attorneys fighting to have the lawsuit dismissed.

The case is Governor Josh Shapiro et al. v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Case No.1:25-cv-00998.

Broad grant cancellations, June 24

Shapiro joined 19 other states and Washington, D.C., in a wide-ranging lawsuit in the U.S. District of Massachusetts challenging Trump’s authority to cancel U.S. grant funding previously awarded, based on the federal administration’s argument that the grants “no longer (effectuate) the program goals or agency priorities.”

On Aug. 4, Judge Indira Talwani issued a partial summary judgment in the states’ favor, ruling the Trump administration could not cancel the grants. But on Sept. 11, Trump’s administration filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The case is ongoing.

U.S. Sen. John Fetterman weighed in on Sept. 18, joining twelve other senators in filing an amicus brief urging the court to rule against the Trump administration.

The case is State of New Jersey et al. v. U.S. Office of Management and Budget et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-11816.

Education funds, July 14

The federal Education Department canceled roughly $230 million in federal funds the Shapiro administration said would assist Pennsylvania schools with buying student technology supplies, providing after-school activities and organizing family literacy programs.

Shapiro joined another highly publicized multistate lawsuit challenging the $6 billion decision in Rhode Island’s federal court. The federal agency last month said it would release $1.3 billion of those funds. The case was dismissed on Sept. 12.

The case is State of California et al. v. McMahon et al., U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island, Case No. 1:25-cv-00329.

Natural disasters, July 16

Shapiro announced on social media last month that he joined an 18-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s cancellation of disaster mitigation funds, including $130 million intended for 47 projects in Pennsylvania.

On Aug. 5, Judge Richard Stearns ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the defendant in the case, to not spend those dollars on any programs other than the disaster relief program it was intended to fund, until a final ruling in the case is made.

Citing the federal government shutdown, the agencies on Oct. 10 sought a pause in the case due to a lack of funding. On Oct. 14, Stearns denied the request. He ruled that resolving the issues are too important to delay

The case is State of Washington et al. v. Federal Emergency Management Agency et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12006.

Affordable Care Act changes, July 17

Shapiro and 20 states claim that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services illegally changed rules surrounding the Affordable Care Act’s state and federal health insurance marketplaces, including shortening enrollment periods and implementing a monthly $5 fee for patients.

The officials also challenged a rule barring transgender health care from the essential benefits requiring Affordable Care Act coverage.

The case is ongoing. It’s titled State of California, et al. v. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12019.

Planned Parenthood, July 29

Trump’s tax and spending megabill from July included a provision that would bar Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest provider of abortions, and its members from accessing Medicaid funds. Shapiro and 22 other state officials say that blockade of funds is illegal because the language of the provision is written so narrowly that it targets Planned Parenthood.

The Democratic officials’ challenge came a day after Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled to block the Trump administration’s barring of funds in a similar lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood. Talwani is also overseeing Shaprio’s lawsuit.

On Oct. 8, Talwani denied the Trump administration’s request to pause court proceedings during the government shutdown.

The case is State of California et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12118.

Gender-affirming care, Aug. 1

Shapiro and 16 other Democratic state officials sued Trump and his administration in Massachusetts over the president’s efforts to restrict gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19, arguing there is no federal law banning medical care for minors.

On Oct. 1, federal Judge Angel Kelley granted the Trump administration’s request to pause proceedings while the federal government is shut down.

The case is Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Trump et al., U.S. District Courts, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12162.

Electric vehicles, Aug. 1

The Trump administration froze some $5 billion to create a national network of electric vehicle charging stations just weeks into his second term in the White House. In May, several Democratic officials across the country filed suit attempting to unfreeze those funds.

In an amended complaint filed Aug. 1, Shapiro signed onto the lawsuit, which is ongoing.

However, both Mamdani and Cuomo have stated that they would defend the city’s sanctuary city status.

As a sanctuary city, New York City agencies are barred from sharing information regarding immigrants with federal authorities unless a crime has been committed. Immigration officials cannot arrest immigrants at city or state facilities such as courthouses or shelters. City law enforcement agencies are also prohibited from honoring “detainer requests” from ICE in most instances in the event of a conviction of a violent crime.

New York’s status as a sanctuary city dates back to executive orders issued by the Koch administration in 1989, but the status became official city law in 2011.

Immigrants are vital to New York’s mosaic as the city is home to 3.1 million foreign-born residents, who speak over 800 languages. Affordability, transportation, and public safety all impact immigrants, however, the Trump administration’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda has pushed the question of immigration and the treatment of immigrants to the forefront of city politics.

Recent high-profile arrests of city and state elected officials at immigration courts and the 400% spike in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers in New York City have left many asking how the next mayor will respond.

In June, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against New York City in an effort to dismantle the city’s sanctuary policy. Following the Trump administration’s suit, Mayor Eric Adams called for the city to modify its sanctuary protections for immigrants.

“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council — but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer,” said Kayla Mamelak Altus, the mayor’s spokesperson, in a statement to The City in July.

The federal lawsuit is ongoing, and the City Council has continued to support the city’s sanctuary policies. In September, the City Council successfully blocked the Adams Administration from allowing ICE to open a field office on Rikers Island.

With New York’s status as a sanctuary city subject to intense debate and the looming threat of the Trump administration possibly deploying National Guard troops across the five boroughs, New York’s mayoral candidates have taken varying stances both in support and opposition.

Zohran Mamdani

Mayoral frontrunner and Democratic Party nominee, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, has vowed to preserve the city’s sanctuary status. A Ugandan immigrant himself, Mamdani moved to New York City with his family when he was 7 years old. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, and if elected, he would become the city’s first immigrant mayor.

“We are fighting to keep this city a sanctuary city,” he said during a rally on Staten Island in August. “We will continue to uphold that status and ensure that we do not allow ICE agents entry.”

Mamdani’s rise has added fuel to President Trump’s growing threats against the city, including the threat to deploy troops to the city if Mamdani became mayor.

However, when asked how he would deal with a hostile Trump administration last week on The New Yorker Radio Hour, Mamdani vowed to be strong — but his answer was vague.

“It’s not about Donald Trump versus myself,” he said. “It’s about Donald Trump versus the city. And that’s why you need someone leading the city that can build a front of New Yorkers who have a wide variety of politics, but are united on the question of this city, and the importance of it, and the fact that the federal government shouldn’t be attacking the very existence of it.”

As an Assemblymember from Astoria, Queens, Mamdani has co-sponsored several bills aimed at strengthening the legal rights of immigrant New Yorkers. In January, he co-sponsored a bill that would provide the right to legal counsel in immigration court proceedings. He also co-sponsored another bill, which would prevent state, county, municipal, and local government agencies from entering into or renewing immigration detention agreements or receiving payments related to immigrant detention.

Both bills are still pending.

Andrew Cuomo

Trailing behind Mamdani in the polls by 13 points is former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent on the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Like Mamdani, Cuomo also defends the city’s sanctuary status.

On June 10, Cuomo announced his 6-Point plan in response to the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles on June 8. In his plan, he vows to guarantee immediate legal defense for those targeted by ICE as well as monitoring the NYPD to ensure they enforce the city’s sanctuary laws.

During his time in Albany, Cuomo had a proven track record of supporting immigrants. In 2017, he issued an executive order prohibiting state agencies from inquiring about individuals’ immigration status. The order also restricted state agencies from sharing immigration status between state and federal authorities, as well as using state resources in immigration enforcement. A year later, in 2018, Cuomo issued another executive order prohibiting ICE from entering state facilities to arrest undocumented immigrants without a judicial warrant.

In addition to his executive orders, while governor, Cuomo suspended New York’s participation in the federal “Secure Communities” program in 2011. The federal program, which began in 2008, shared personal data of every person arrested and fingerprinted from local jails with federal immigration authorities. As a result, the program led to the deportation of over 450,000 people between 2008 and 2014.

Yet, despite his track record of supporting undocumented immigrants while he was governor, Cuomo has been criticized by the Mamdani campaign for courting the Trump base to win the election. In August, The New York Times reported that during a fundraiser with business leaders, Cuomo said he did not“personally want to fight Trump.” The story also reported that Cuomo had several phone calls with the President, discussing the race — a claim that Cuomo denied.

Curtis Sliwa

Unlike Mamdani or Cuomo, Guardian Angels founder and Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa opposes the city’s sanctuary laws. While he maintains that New York should remain a “city of compassion,” he also believes that sanctuary laws shield violent criminals from deportation.

However, Sliwa has pledged that he would not unilaterally revoke the city’s sanctuary status. Instead, he favors putting the question of the city’s sanctuary status directly to the voters through a ballot initiative, asking them if they want to repeal the city’s sanctuary status.",https://documentedny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/46639167082_e4c1bc912d_k-jpg-e1738168047802.webp,N,,2025-10-16 15:02:36.479929

Leeann Culbreath, an Episcopal priest and immigrant rights advocate in Tifton, called the decision to restart immigrant detention at Irwin unconscionable.
She said it’s too early for immigrant advocates to know how they will respond to the new immigrant detainees housed at Irwin.","OCILLA – Just four years after the Biden administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement severed ties with an Irwin County Detention Center over abuse, the facility is once again receiving immigrant detainees.

The Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) in Ocilla,, a south Georgia town about 60 miles east of Albany with about 3,000 residents, ended its ICE agreement in 2021 after repeated reports of abuse and medical misconduct. In 2022, Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., unveiled a nearly two-year bipartisan investigation that found female detainees at the ICDC were subjected to “invasive, and often unnecessary gynecological procedures.”

On Tuesday, Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s assistant public affairs secretary, confirmed to The Albany Herald that there is an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. Marshals and Irwin County to use up to 1,200 beds at the county detention center. It has already begun taking male, adult detainees. It will not be used for families.

In the days since finding out about the resumption of detaining migrants at ICDC, Georgia immigrant advocacy groups, many of whom fought for the ICDC’s closure, have condemned the decision.

“The re-opening of ICDC should alarm us all,” Amilcar Valencia, the executive director of El Refugio, a Stewart County hospitality home, wrote. “People at this … immigrant detention center have been subjected to horrific abuse, and their fundamental human rights have been systematically violated. We cannot let more be put at risk.”

Advocacy groups are calling upon members of Congress, local officials and community members to reject the decision.

Leeann Culbreath, an Episcopal priest and immigrant rights advocate in Tifton, called the decision to restart immigrant detention at Irwin unconscionable.

For years, Culbreath was face-to-face with immigrant detainees at ICDC and their families. She began visiting detainees in 2016 with a group of other volunteers. She said many people had been transferred from Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin and had no family or friends to visit with them in Ocilla.

“So we just started to listen to their stories,” Culbreath said. “The conditions there were inhumane for all of the years that I visited people there, and I don’t know anybody there who did not experience some kind of neglect of their rights or actual abuse: medical, physical, emotional, psychological.”

She also learned from detainees that there was no support system for their family members.

“It was a very difficult and stressful experience for people to make that trip to such a small community in the middle of nowhere with no public transportation,” Culbreath said. “They don’t know where to stay, if they’re safe, if they can get a meal.”

So Culbreath and others opened Casa Colibrí,, a hospitality home where families of immigrant detainees could rest, eat and get connected with resources. It also housed pro bono attorneys and social workers who commuted back and forth to ICDC. The group worked with a chaplain to provide deportation or release bags with clothing and toiletries.

While Casa Colibrí closed in 2020, this level of closeness with immigrant detainees and their families meant Culbreath heard first-hand tales of abuse, and she and others began advocating for ICDC’s closure.

She said when the ICE contract was severed in 2021, advocates felt a mix of emotions.

“There was elation because we believed at the time that no more people would suffer that kind of abuse at that place and that there might be a chance for justice for those who suffered abuse in that facility,” Culbreath said. “We felt like we had been screaming at a brick wall for years and finally felt heard.”

However after the closure, ICE quickly began transferring people from Irwin to the Stewart Detention Center, a privately owned prison about 100 miles away where at least 13 people have died since 2006.

“The justice that we hoped for and the care for survivors never materialized,” Culbreath said.

She said some people are still fighting cases and still do not have permanent status in the U.S., and they face the possibility of being detained again or deported.

“Women are still suffering trauma with PTSD, struggling economically, trying to rebuild their lives,” Culbreath said. “They did all the speaking out and testifying, and they haven’t gotten anything for putting themselves out there and reliving the trauma over and over again.”

She said restarting immigration detention at the ICDC just “re-traumatizes everybody.”

“The wounds are still open,” Culbreath said.

She said it’s too early for immigrant advocates to know how they will respond to the new immigrant detainees housed at Irwin.

“What we do know is that advocates and formerly detained persons and their loved ones in Georgia and beyond will continue to speak out about abuses that they experience,” Culbreath said. “We want to continue to try to provide whatever support is needed for those who are detained.”

She said advocates will continue to ensure detainees have access to legal support and will work with legislators in addressing the needs of those who have been harmed.

“We’ll be monitoring it as best as we’re able,” Culbreath said.

McLaughlin said the Irwin facility will be subject to inspection by the ICE Professional Responsibility Office of Detention Oversight and additional oversight by ICE’s Enforcement Removal Operations custody management.

Culbreath said immigration detention and prolonged imprisonment shouldn’t be a part of the U.S. immigration system.

“Detention … it’s not criminal, but people are housed in prisons and they wear prison jump suits and they’re shackled when they’re transported, so they’re treated as criminals,” she said. “To not meet very basic needs, to use solitary confinement as a form of punishment or to silence dissent – that’s not humane and it can’t be made humane.”",https://d2mq8ajyfy4fws.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16134054/casa-colibri.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 15:02:04.566436

The letter also underscores that the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, operated by the GEO Group, has been repeatedly cited for unsafe, unsanitary, and life-threatening conditions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, Rep Judy Chu (CA-28) led 31 Members of Congress in a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Noem and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)Acting Director Lyons demanding answers and accountability regarding the untimely death of Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old resident of Westminster, California, who died while in ICE custody on September 22, 2025, after his repeated pleas for medical care were ignored at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.

Mr. Ayala-Uribe came to the United States when he was four years old and had lived here his entire life. While detained at Adelanto, he became ill and reported having fever, pain, and worsening symptoms. Yet instead of receiving care, he was dismissed by Adelanto’s medical staff and sent back to his dormitory. For three days, his condition deteriorated without proper treatment. By the time he was finally transported to the hospital, it was too late. At just 39 years old, he died before receiving the surgery that could have saved his life.

“Mr. Ayala-Uribe’s untimely death while in ICE custody was a preventable tragedy. His pleas for help were ignored by those responsible for overseeing his care until it was far too late. This was an inexcusable failure to uphold even the most basic standards of medical care for people in federal custody,” said Rep. Chu. “But what happened to Mr. Ayala-Uribe is sadly not an isolated incident. It reflects a horrific, well-documented pattern of neglect at Adelanto, where detainees have been forced to endure conditions so dangerous and inhumane that they have led to multiple deaths. That’s why we are demanding full transparency and accountability to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.”

The letter presses DHS and ICE for a full accounting of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ayala-Uribe’s death, including the medical decisions made at Adelanto and what corrective actions are being implemented. The letter also underscores that the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, operated by the GEO Group, has been repeatedly cited for unsafe, unsanitary, and life-threatening conditions. Since January 2025, at least 15 people have died in federal immigration custody, marking a sharp increase from previous years, including during the first Trump administration. For more than a decade, Rep. Chu has called for the closure of Adelanto and continues to urge DHS to immediately shut down the facility, citing the long history of abuse, medical neglect, and human rights violations.

Rep. Chu’s letter was signed by 31 Members of Congress: Reps.

And agents were generally required not to take civil enforcement actions against immigrants who were applying for legal relief as crime victims.
New policies also have expanded the ability of agents to operate in “sensitive zones,” areas that had been considered off limits for immigration enforcement, like women’s shelters, schools and churches.
In an interview, Ms. Ruano, 38, said she had sought safety in the United States twice.
Years later, though, with her petition for asylum still unresolved, a lawyer suggested that she withdraw that petition and apply instead for a T visa, the type that protects trafficking victims.","Four months ago, Yessenia Ruano put her home in Wisconsin up for rent, packed a few bags and left for her native El Salvador. She had fled gang violence in her homeland, and said she had survived forced labor on her journey north. But after living and working in the United States for 14 years as she fought a deportation order, Ms. Ruano seemed to be out of options.

Legal protections that had allowed her to stay while she sought permanent residency began falling away when President Trump expanded his mass deportation effort. Even though her petition to obtain a special visa available to victims of human trafficking was still pending, federal immigration officials refused to delay their efforts to remove her from the country.

Now, Ms. Ruano and several other immigrants say that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is violating the law by detaining and deporting victims of domestic violence or human trafficking who have applied for protection.

In a lawsuit filed this week in federal court in Los Angeles, lawyers for Ms. Ruano and the other plaintiffs say that the Trump administration’s policies violate the immigration relief provisions of the Violence Against Women Act and other measures that Congress established to safeguard victims and encourage them to work with the authorities.

Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, one of the nonprofits leading the case, said the government was breaking its legal bargain with vulnerable people who had taken “a dramatic and courageous step in coming forward.”

“Our government is turning its back — arresting, punishing and deporting those individuals — and what we’re going to be left with is an even more traumatized, less open membership in our community, and it’s going to make us all less safe,” Mr. Perez said in an interview.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that every unauthorized immigrant whom ICE has removed from the country has “had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

The lawsuit filed in federal court late Tuesday is one of at least five that challenge the practices of ICE agents and other officers as the federal government has intensified its immigration crackdown in major cities including Chicago; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C.

Under prior administrations, ICE agents were directed to focus on protecting victims when they were questioning unauthorized immigrants who had endured serious or violent crimes. And agents were generally required not to take civil enforcement actions against immigrants who were applying for legal relief as crime victims.

But the agency rescinded those policies early this year. An ICE memorandum told agents to follow an executive order issued by President Trump on the day he was sworn in for his second term, calling for “total and efficient enforcement” of immigration laws.

Anti-immigrant groups and activists have long argued that some kinds of victim-based immigration relief was ripe for fraud and exploitation, and that it tied the hands of law enforcement agencies in pursuing criminals. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for Mr. Trump’s second term called for the elimination of U and T visas, which protect immigrants who are victims of domestic violence or human trafficking.

Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center, said the administration’s policy changes gave “ICE more flexibility to proceed with removal proceedings, whether that is for a crime or a prior order of removal.”

Lawyers and immigrant rights groups counter that under the new ICE policies, federal officers have been putting victims in expedited removal processes, detaining them for long periods or deporting them before they have had a chance to plead their case. New policies also have expanded the ability of agents to operate in “sensitive zones,” areas that had been considered off limits for immigration enforcement, like women’s shelters, schools and churches.

Prosecutors and victim services providers say that T and U visas provide important protection for people who testify in court to help hold traffickers and abusers accountable. Those prosecutions can take years to complete and involve extensive, invasive questioning, they say, and the fear stirred up by the Trump administration has made it even harder for them to persuade victims to cooperate.

“It creates more dangerous situations, because the longer the abuse goes unreported, the more we find that it escalates,” said Erin Aiello, an assistant district attorney and chief of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit at the Northwestern District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts.

Another plaintiff, Kenia Jackeline Merlos, 43, a native of Honduras, has been held at a federal detention center in Washington State since June. Ms. Merlos applied for a U visa in March 2024, citing an episode about a year earlier in which she and her husband were threatened by a man with a gun. They reported the crime and cooperated with the investigation, the lawsuit says.

Ms. Merlos and her four children, who are U.S. citizens, were rounded up over the summer at a park near the Canadian border, where they were spending time with relatives including her parents, who were visiting from Honduras on tourist visas.

Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they endured physical or sexual abuse at the hands of spouses, relatives or others, the court papers say.

In an interview, Ms. Ruano, 38, said she had sought safety in the United States twice. The first time ended in 2011 when she was deported without being given a chance to plead for asylum. She returned that same year, fleeing gang violence in El Salvador, and on the way north, was victimized by a labor trafficking operation. Mr. Perez said the details of the trafficking case would be filed under seal to protect her against retaliation.

When she reached the United States the second time, a judge granted her permission to remain in the country and work while she pursued her asylum case, she said. She worked at a pizza factory in Milwaukee and eventually became a teacher’s aide. She married, and she and her husband, who is not a U.S. citizen, bought a small three-bedroom duplex with a yard for their white poodle mix, Copitos.

The school where she worked was so short of teachers that she was often called upon to substitute in social studies and Spanish classes, she said. “I felt really useful,” she said.

Years later, though, with her petition for asylum still unresolved, a lawyer suggested that she withdraw that petition and apply instead for a T visa, the type that protects trafficking victims.

She applied in February and requested that deportation proceedings be delayed, but that request was denied. Worried about being separated from her children — 10-year-old twin girls — she felt she had no choice but to self-deport.

With the permission of a judge, she left the country with the girls in June, she said, and her husband followed with their dog a month later.

“My hope now is that we can return,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15nat-immig-violence-01-jqbp/15nat-immig-violence-01-jqbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 14:02:54.014407

In May, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order pausing Judge Chen’s temporary injunction while the case was being litigated.","This post is part of Challenging Precedent, a blog of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice examining race, law, and regulation in the Trump era.

In recent news, a federal judge temporarily blocks the deployment of National Guardsmen to Portland following ICE protests, the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelans while a ruling vacating the termination is appealed, and a federal judge prohibits ICE from detaining unaccompanied minors in adult detention facilities upon reaching the age of 18.

On October 5th, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut of Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guardsmen from anywhere in the U.S. to Portland. Yesterday Judge Immergut extended the temporary orders for another 14 days. The court’s initial ruling came just one day after temporarily enjoining the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to the city. After receiving a request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in putting “an end to the migrant invasion and these lawless riots,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the deployment of Oregon Guardsmen to the city against the wishes of Governor Tina Kotek. Though increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in June had led to protests in Portland, the court’s opinion noted “it had been months since there was any sustained level of violent or disruptive protest activity” in the city. Judge Immergut further held that Trump’s deployment “exceeds the constitutional authority that Congress granted him,” and “undermine[s] the sovereign interest of Oregon as protected by the Tenth Amendment.” Despite the injunction, the Trump administration mobilized hundreds of California and Texas National Guardsmen to Portland without an official announcement, prompting the second, more expansive restraining order. The White House plans to appeal the decision.

On October 3rd, The Supreme Court issued an order allowing the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans while the government appeals a ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco that blocked DHS Secretary Kristi Noem from ending that status. Created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS protects eligible migrants from being detained and deported to countries that have been designated as having conditions that make it unsafe or inadequate for people to return. The Biden administration first granted TPS for Venezuelans in March 2021 and extended protections for an additional 18 months just two weeks before Trump took office. In February, the Trump administration subsequently vacated the extension and terminated TPS early for over 300,000 Venezuelans.

In May, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order pausing Judge Chen’s temporary injunction while the case was being litigated. The case reached a final judgement on September 5, when Judge Chen ruled DHS did not have the lawful authority to terminate the designation and extension. After the Ninth Circuit declined to block Chen’s ruling and the administration sought emergency relief, the Supreme Court issued another unsigned order allowing DHS to terminate TPS for Venezuelans while the Government appeals. The court noted “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not” changed so “[t]he same result that [the Court] reached in May is appropriate here.” Justice Jackson dissented, criticizing the Court for leaving “300,000 human beings…vulnerable to job loss, family separation, and deportation” and for using its “equitable power (but not [its] opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

On October 4th, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from detaining migrant children past their 18th birthdays. The ruling rests on an earlier case decided by Judge Contreras in 2021, which found ICE’s migrant children detention policy was a “pervasive violation” of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and issued a five-year permanent injunction. The ICE policy at issue in that case permitted unaccompanied minors, held in shelters by the Department of Health and Human Services, to be transferred to ICE adult detention facilities upon reaching their 18th birthdays. There, the court held that federal law required unaccompanied minors who reach the age of 18 to be released to the least restrictive setting available. In most cases, that setting is in the home of a relative. On October 1, 2025, ICE purportedly changed its policies to no longer allow unaccompanied minors who turn 18, even those with approved release plans, to be released and instead required them to be transferred to adult detention facilities. Responding to an emergency motion, Judge Contreras found this automatic detention contravened the earlier permanent injunction and enjoined ICE from “implementing any new directive regarding age-outs.”

Jayapal played an instrumental role in the original closure of the facility.

“It is deeply disturbing and dangerous that the Trump administration is choosing to reopen the private, for-profit Irwin Detention Center. In 2020, during the first Trump administration, I was the first member of Congress to speak to attorneys representing women who were detained at Irwin and subjected to forced medical procedures, including full or partial hysterectomies, without their knowledge or consent. These invasive and unnecessary procedures left multiple women without the ability to have children. Following the passage of a bipartisan resolution I led in October 2020, the Department of Homeland (DHS) Security ended its use of the facility in May 2021.

“The idea that this administration would now actively choose to detain individuals there again is unacceptable. The administration has already gutted any existing oversight mechanisms that were at least bare bones guardrails of unaccountable private, for-profit detention centers and their abuse of existing standards of care. Today, the growth of these for-profit immigrant incarceration facilities has only ballooned, with no-bid contracts being awarded to entities that have no experience, no ability, and no desire to ensure humane standards of care.

“The Trump administration’s move to reopen a facility that was the site of so many horrors, with zero oversight in place, is malicious and negligent. The reported death of the 20th person in ICE detention in just nine months of this Administration’s rule shows exactly how deeply we need to completely reform and rein in an abusive for-profit detention system.

“I call on Secretary Noem and the Trump administration to reconsider this dangerous and cruel decision.”

In September of 2020, Congresswoman Jayapal led 173 lawmakers in urging the DHS Inspector General to open an immediate investigation following a whistleblower allegation of mass hysterectomies being performed on women detained at the Irwin County Detention Center. She was also the first member to speak with attorneys representing women, during which she learned that at a minimum, 17 women had been subjected to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures, often without appropriate consent or knowledge. Later that month, she traveled to the facility, and following that visit led 181 lawmakers in introducing a resolution to condemn the forced procedures. The resolution passed the House in early October 2020 with bipartisan support. The DHS ended its use of the facility in May 2021.

The chief denied any involvement with ICE and the investigation had been taken over by federal authorities.","(This story has been updated with additional information.)

Federal agents arrested a man after an alleged crash involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle in Oxnard Oct. 16.

Officers with the Oxnard Police Department stopped a Nissan Frontier truck in the area of Eighth Street and A Street around 7:48 a.m. after ICE alleged that the truck driver had collided with a Jeep Grand Cherokee and driven away, according to a written statement by Police Chief Jason Benites.

Assistant Police Chief Rocky Marquez previously said that one vehicle was an ICE vehicle and the other was not.

A video shared on Instagram by VC Defensa, a volunteer group that helps provide immigration information, showed the Jeep Grand Cherokee, allegedly belonging to an ICE agent, crashing into the Nissan Frontier, which the group said belonged to one of its volunteers.

The video shows the Nissan making a U-turn and the Jeep following close behind. As the Nissan pulls out of the turn and straightens out, the Cherokee appears to speed up, pull up along the driver's side of the Nissan and ram the truck.

While both vehicles appear close to each other at the start of the clip, it's not clear what interaction, if any, preceded the collision. A message left with ICE was not immediately returned.

Benites said federal authorities alleged that the crash was intentional and asserted a crime had been committed on a federal officer.

Oxnard Police was also asked to help keep the peace between the ICE agents and the growing crowd of about 80 protesters that gathered at the scene, authorities said.

In videos shared on social media, an empty lot in the area had been cordoned off with yellow caution tape to keep protesters out during the investigation. The live stream after the crash also shows multiple vehicles, some unmarked and some Oxnard Police SUVS with lights flashing in the lot and a number of Oxnard police officers standing in the area.

No injuries were reported to the police department, and they were not assisting DHS in the investigation, Assistant Police Chief Rocky Marquez said.

The chief denied any involvement with ICE and the investigation had been taken over by federal authorities.","https://www.vcstar.com/gcdn/presto/2019/06/11/PVCS/0fd14421-7bcc-4567-a066-b6a547a488a2-DSC06105.JPG?crop=4863,2735,x1,y335&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-16 18:03:01.552770

A wrongful arrest occurs when a person’s rights are potentially violated when arrested by law enforcement, for example, if someone is not given a chance to contact an attorney or told why they’ve been arrested.

Several people have also used habeas cases to win their release from the Tacoma detention center, cases with similarities to an arrest this summer that impacted a family in West Seattle.

It was late July, and Cheryl Eugenio was in the parking lot of the Department of Homeland Security building in Tukwila with her three children when she checked her phone. She had a missed call and a voicemail from her husband, Alan Phetsadakone.

“Hey, I’m getting taken in,” he said. “I’m going to be in Tacoma, the Tacoma detention center. I’ll try to call later, OK? Alright, I love you guys. Bye.”

Phetsadakone had gone in for a routine check-in with ICE, as he had done for the past few decades. Eugenio said there was no notice, no indication at all that they were going to detain him — a red flag that a lawyer would later key in on, and a common thread in other unlawful arrest cases.

But in the moment, Eugenio didn’t know what was happening.

“I've replayed it, like, ‘Did I hear that right?’” she said.

Moments after she heard the voicemail she went into the Tukwila federal facility to find out why her husband had been arrested. Eugenio said ICE agents wouldn’t answer her questions or provide more information.

Phetsadakone was brought to the U.S. at the age of 3 as a refugee from Laos. More than 20 years ago, he was convicted of a nonviolent felony for bank fraud, for which he got a deportation order. At that time, Laos refused to accept deportees, so he was released on the condition that he check in regularly with ICE.

Sponsored

Earlier this year, the federal government began attempting to deport former refugees like Phetsadakone. Eugenio saw the stories, but didn’t expect it could happen to her husband.

“At first, I was still in shock,” she said. “It's like all these thoughts running through your head. Like, what's my next step? What do I have to do?”

Word about Phetsadakone's case spread through their community in West Seattle, and he was able to get help from the Seattle Clemency Project.

“The government [was] trying to expeditiously deport him,” said Jennie Pasquarella, the organization’s legal director.

Sponsored

Pasquarella and her team allege Phetsadakone’s arrest was unlawful, because ICE didn’t notify him of their intention to suspend his supervised release and attempt to deport him.

“He's been dutifully checking in with ICE as required under his order of supervision, and so, when he went for his check-in just this past July, he thought it would be the same as it always has been,” Pasquarella said.

Pasquarella also said Phetsadakone’s attorney during his original federal case failed to properly represent and advise him about the immigration consequences of his felony conviction. That finding could lay the groundwork to potentially throw out that conviction, the foundation of Phetsadakone’s deportation order — and he could get legal status again, this time through family members who are citizens.

In court, government attorneys argued Phetsadakone had a standing deportation order, and that they had the required documents to re-detain him and send him to Laos.

But Phetsadakone’s lawyers said those documents weren’t signed by any immigration official, and the deportation papers were only presented after he was detained — another red flag.

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle said the inconsistencies raised serious questions of due process, suggesting ICE didn’t follow its own rules of supervised release.

“These disputed facts and gaps in the Government’s evidence undermine its claims that it followed the procedures required by its own regulations,” Whitehead wrote in a court document. “While the government has an interest in executing removal orders, agencies cannot act unlawfully even pursuing legitimate ends.”

In that same document — a temporary restraining order against the federal government — Whitehead ordered ICE to release Phetsadakone.

Before he was arrested, Phetsadakone and his wife had been taking stock of their life, putting things into their garage for donation and organizing kitchenware and home goods into piles.

They do this every time their kids move forward in a stage in their lives. One of their oldest children has started college. Their youngest is now a teenager.

Standing in front of a garage full of donations, a truck his father-in-law gave him to fix up, and a grill, Phetsadakone was clearly proud of the life he and his wife had created. Despite everything he's been through, he said he remains excited about the future.

“I don’t know how to explain it,” he said. “It’s like America in a sense.”

He’ll have to check in with ICE again this week and in the coming months. Phetsadakone still has to fight his deportation in court. But, he said, that will be a lot easier from outside of detention.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/9da526136df13c554eee770af6079f50.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-10-16 14:03:06.563579

Are European immigrants being detained and deported at similar rates?","By Howard Fletcher

In recent years, the discourse surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States has become increasingly polarized and disturbingly opaque. While policymakers tout “law and order,” the actual data on who is targeted, detained, and deported remains elusive—raising troubling questions about transparency and racial bias.

Why are comprehensive numbers on European or Asian immigrants so challenging to find? It’s a fair question to ask when the focus of enforcement seems disproportionately concentrated on Black and Brown populations, especially those from Africa and Latin America.

Reports and data often highlight the surge in deportations of nationals from Mexico, Central America, and increasingly, Venezuela and other South American nations. Meanwhile, European immigrants—whether asylum seekers or tourists overstaying visas—rarely seem to be a focus of enforcement, and comprehensive data on their numbers and treatment are notably absent.

This discrepancy is not accidental. It underscores a persistent pattern: enforcement efforts are directed more aggressively toward Black and Brown communities, reflecting racial biases rather than a balanced approach to immigration control. The lack of transparent, publicly available data on European or Asian immigrants suggests a clear double standard.

Why does this matter?

For one, it erodes trust in the fairness of immigration policies. When enforcement appears to be based on racial profiling, it fuels fear and division, undermining the very ideals of justice and equality. Moreover, the focus on Latin American and African immigrants often ignores the broader economic, cultural, and humanitarian contributions these communities make, instead framing them as “problems” to be solved.

Without proper data, policymakers and the public are left in the dark about the scope and impact of enforcement on different communities. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security does not publish detailed breakdowns of arrests and deportations by race or country of origin beyond a handful of Latin American nations. That absence makes it nearly impossible to assess whether ICE is targeting migrants equitably or disproportionately focusing on specific groups.

Consider a 2025 congressional inquiry led by Representatives Juan Vargas and Darren Soto, which revealed that nearly 90% of ICE street arrests involved people of Latin American descent—even though migrants from Europe, Asia, and Canada also make up a significant share of the undocumented population in the U.S. Though we may have our suspicions, without comprehensive demographic data, it’s impossible to determine whether or not that figure reflects accurate population proportions.

This lack of transparency doesn’t just obscure potential bias—it also prevents meaningful policy reform. If ICE and DHS released comprehensive, disaggregated statistics on all immigrant groups, the public could hold the system accountable and identify inequities early, rather than relying on scattered reports, whistleblowers, or civil rights lawsuits to reveal them years later.

Are European immigrants being detained and deported at similar rates? Are they being subjected to the same level of scrutiny? (We know they’re not.) The silence suggests that enforcement is not applied evenly but is instead used as a tool to publicly target those perceived as “other.”

This selective enforcement echoes historical patterns of racial discrimination that have long plagued our immigration policies. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the targeting of Mexican workers, the United States has a troubling legacy of marginalizing non-white populations under the guise of national security or economic necessity. The Trump administration’s policies continue this pattern, prioritizing deportations that disproportionately impact communities of color, often without transparent justification or data to support such focus.

Furthermore, the rhetoric used to justify these policies often dehumanizes the targeted populations, perpetuating racial stereotypes and undermining America’s commitment to human rights and the rule of law.

The question then becomes: why is there such a lack of transparency? The answer likely lies in political convenience. Focusing enforcement on Black and Brown communities provides a narrative that aligns with certain political agendas—one that emphasizes “securing borders” and “cracking down” on specific populations, often at the expense of truth and fairness.

To move toward a more equitable immigration system, transparency must be prioritized. Data should be publicly accessible, comprehensive, and disaggregated by country of origin, race, and ethnicity. Take California’s Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA), for example. After the state began requiring police departments to collect and publish data by race and ethnicity, analysis revealed stark racial disparities in traffic stops and searches. Those findings prompted several departments—including Los Angeles and San Francisco—to revise training protocols, limit pretextual stops, and increase oversight of enforcement practices.

If America truly aspires to be a nation of laws, it must first be a nation of truth. Transparency in data isn’t a bureaucratic demand—it’s a moral one, a measure of whether our justice system serves equality or enforces hierarchy. Until we confront who is being targeted, and why, we cannot claim that our immigration system reflects the values we so often preach to the world.",https://couriernewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/257/CHR_Thumbnail_-_2025-10-16T092732.569_2000x1125-1024x576.png,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:36.849407

“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump told reporters.","House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday hammered the Trump administration’s effort to provide $40 billion to help Argentina’s conservative leader weather that country’s financial crisis.

Jeffries wondered why Republicans in Washington are willing to secure so much funding for a foreign government but are balking at Democratic demands to subsidize health care for working class people at home.

“It’s perplexing to us that Republicans refuse to spend a dime to protect the health care of the American people, but somehow the Trump administration found $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina,” Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol.

Hours earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the administration is seeking $20 billion in new funding for the government of Argentine President Javier Milei, a right-wing populist allied with Trump. That’s on top of $20 billion the administration has already provided to help Milei prop up a crumbling economy.

The first round of funding came earlier in the month, in the form of a direct currency swap. The second, Bessent said, would originate from sovereign funds and the private sector, not U.S. taxpayers.

“Many banks are interested in it and many sovereign funds have expressed interest,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

Argentina has come under fire from lawmakers in both parties for increasing its soybean sales to China after Beijing stopped purchasing American soybeans in response to Trump’s tariffs. Jeffries is among those lawmakers, and he criticized the administration for propping up the Argentinian economy but not U.S. farmers.

“That’s outrageous. This is corruption in real time,” Jeffries said. “It’s having serious consequences on the American people.”

On Tuesday, Milei had visited the White House to meet with Trump. Afterward, Trump said he might withhold the billions of dollars earmarked for Argentina if Milei’s party loses in national elections slated for later this month.

“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump told reporters.

“I think he’s going to win,” he continued. “And if he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.”

The comments were criticized by opposition leaders in Argentina, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who accused the president of dangling the funds in an effort to influence the outcome of a foreign election.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/jeffrieshakeem_101425gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:32.569291

“You’re saying sometimes it’s acceptable for a federal district court to order a map that intentionally discriminates on the basis of race?” Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Donald Trump appointee, asked voting advocates.

Louisiana added a second majority-Black district after multiple courts concluded that its congressional maps likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory vote dilution. The conservative justices were concerned about how race played into Louisiana’s new maps, questioning whether they violated the 14th and 15th Amendments.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, said that courts can use race to create remedial maps “so long as it’s not excessive,” but he questioned whether that practice should cease.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” Kavanaugh said. “What exactly do you think the end point should be for the intentional use of race to create districts?”

Louisiana’s first set of new maps only included one majority-Black district despite Black voters making up 30% of the adult population in the state. Civil rights groups sued Louisiana for diluting the votes of Black voters, and after a protracted legal battle and federal court ruling, the state Legislature drew new maps in 2024 with a second majority-Black district.

Litigation continued, however, after a group of “non-African American voters” sued the state — so far unsuccessfully — claiming the new maps are unconstitutional because they considered race.

In March, the Supreme Court heard arguments over whether the Legislature relied too heavily on race when redrawing Louisiana’s maps. Instead of issuing a decision in June, the justices delayed a decision and scheduled an additional argument this term.

The conservative justices looked likely to throw out Louisiana’s 2024 maps. Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, was one of several justices to note that Louisiana’s remedial map was drawn based on a preliminary decision in the lower courts.

“Under protest, we drew [the 2024 map] because the threat was that the federal courts were going to do it if we didn’t,” J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, said.

To avoid violating the equal protection clause, legislatures have a compelling interest to use race when drawing maps. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, questioned whether the state’s reasoning qualified.

“The state would have to say at that point: ‘Well, we’re weighing race heavily because we have a compelling interest in avoiding a Section 2 violation,’” Barrett said. “The state’s position might be we don’t actually really think that we violated Section 2, but we have a litigation risk.”

Barrett suggested that the court clarify its prior rulings that created the standard for when race could be used to remedy a Voting Rights Act violation.

Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that the court’s prior rulings already provided exacting and robust requirements for litigating Section 2 claims. Nelson noted that the court recently reaffirmed those precedents in a 2022 case regarding redistricting in Alabama.

“This court [has] said that it must be particularly concerned about changing its decisions or rejecting stare decisis in cases that involve a sensitive political context like this one,” Nelson, who argued for the voting advocates, said. “That calls the court’s legitimacy into question in a new unique way.”

Because many states have used Section 2 to draw their districts, the voting advocates warned that removing its protections would lead to a resurgence of discrimination. One report estimated that if the Supreme Court sides with Louisiana, Republicans could secure an additional 19 safe seats in the House of Representatives and cement GOP control for at least a generation.

While all the conservatives seemed to take issue with Louisiana’s 2024 maps, there wasn’t a consensus on how to fix them. The liberal justices were concerned that their colleagues’ solution would gut what’s left of the landmark law.

“The bottom line is just get rid of Section 2,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Obama appointee, said, describing one potential solution.

Sotomayor said the conservative justices were only looking at the use of race in a negative context.

“Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn’t deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor said.

Justice Elena Kagan, another Obama appointee, said that race was only used in response to discrimination.

“The race-based redistricting that you’re now objecting to is redistricting designed to remedy a specific, identified, proved violation of law; more, a specific, identified, proved racial discrimination by the state,” Kagan told Louisiana’s solicitor general.

The Trump administration has suggested that the justices consider whether a state’s maps depart from race-neutral principles. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Joe Biden appointee, worried that solution prevented remedies for discrimination in places with a history of segregation, like Louisiana.

“I hear your test not allowing us to solve that problem when the state is continuing to present the same map under circumstances in which people are not actually able to have equal electoral opportunity,” Jackson said.

David Gans, director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program at the Constitutional Accountability Center, predicted that the court would ultimately gut the Voting Rights Act.

“This idea that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments — added to the Constitution to ensure that Black Americans would be full members of the body politic — bars legal remedies for racial vote dilution designed to cancel out Black voting strength turns the Constitution on its head,” Gans said in a statement.

He continued, “In this morning’s oral argument, the court’s conservative justices turned a blind eye to this core part of the Fifteenth Amendment’s text and history.”",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-16 12:58:15.177584

A Bucks County judge upheld Sheriff Fred Harran’s decision to partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, rejecting a legal challenge that sought to block the controversial 287(g) agreement.

The ruling, issued Tuesday by Judge Jeffrey G. Trauger of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, allows the sheriff’s office to proceed with the ICE cooperation agreement — at least for now — despite opposition from county commissioners, immigrant rights advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania.

The decision comes as Harran, a Republican, seeks reelection as he fends off a challenge by Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler.

Harran released a statement shortly after the decision, calling it “a victory for the law-abiding residents of Bucks County and a validation of a common-sense approach to public safety which fully leverages partnerships and resources to keep our communities safe.”

“This decision affirms our ability to use this simple tool to ensure individuals who commit crimes in our county are held fully accountable – regardless of their immigration status,” he wrote.

Stephen Loney, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU, said the “fight is far from over.”

“It’s unfortunate that the judge in this case failed to appreciate what the law clearly states; the sheriff does not have authority to sign onto a 287(g) agreement with ICE,” Loney said in a statement. “We will appeal this decision and, in the meantime, we will continue to work to hold Sheriff Harran accountable to the rule of law.”

Harran signed the 287(g) “task force” model agreement with ICE in April. Under that model, trained local deputies may act in a limited immigration enforcement capacity, including serving ICE warrants and checking individuals in custody against ICE databases.

That led to a series of protests by local activists and contentious court proceedings.

No standing

The lawsuit, filed in June, argued that Sheriff Harran lacked legal authority to enter into a 287(g) agreement without approval from the county’s Board of Commissioners. Plaintiffs, including Make the Road, NAACP Bucks County, Buxmont Unitarian Universalist Fellowship and Juan Navia, a Bucks County resident who claimed the arrangement violated Pennsylvania law and posed risks to civil rights and public trust.

However, in the 13-page decision, Judge Trauger found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the case at this stage because of a lack of harm from an agreement that is not yet in effect.

“Plaintiffs here are alleging injuries that are not immediate or substantial,” Trauger wrote. “Rather, in their complaint, they allege what are clearly only speculative future injuries based on speculative future events.”

The decision singled out Navia, who was asked to join the plaintiffs and argued in court that he and his family feared they would be subjected to an increase in racial profiling. During cross-examination, Navia said he did not know of anyone who was already affected.

Traugher wrote that Navia “baldly alleges that he is at an increased risk of profiling” but “alleges wholly subjective fears of possible future incidents, including racial profiling, warrantless searches and arrests.”

As a result, the judge said, “none of the Plaintiffs have proper standing to bring this action.”

On whose authority?

Traugher’s decision did find that the Bucks County Board of Commissioners had standing to pursue their challenge. In May, the board passed a resolution reaffirming its sole contractual authority and declaring the 287(g) agreement invalid, citing concerns about liability costs. Commissioners Diane Ellis‑Maresiglia and Bob Harvie supported the resolution; Commissioner Gene DiGirolamo dissented, voicing confidence in Harran’s approach.

The commissioners separately challenged Harran’s agreement with ICE, arguing that Harran was legally required under state law to seek approval from the county commissioners before entering into binding agreements on behalf of the county and that the sheriff cannot unilaterally bind the county to a federal partnership.

However, the judge disagreed, finding that “the documents signed by the Sheriff are not an enforceable contract and therefore were not subject to the approval” of the commissioners.

He also cited earlier agreements with federal agencies that the sheriff entered into without objection, such as those with the U.S. Marshals and ICE Homeland Security Investigations, which “did not include or require any County Commissioner approval.”

The decision also notes that Harran signed the memorandum of understanding with “limited intent,” designating only three officers to take on the outlined duties and keeping those duties limited.

What’s next?

Critics warn that the 287(g) task force model has a history of racial profiling, overreach and misuse in other jurisdictions. They argue that immigrant victims of crime may be less willing to report crimes or cooperate with law enforcement if local deputies are seen as ICE proxies.

However, Harran has emphasized that the agreement would be targeted, not sweeping. He said the program will only involve those already in custody on criminal or warrant charges and not routine traffic stops, and that he is not seeking to deputize deputies to police immigration status generally.

He has also asserted that the program would come at zero cost to county taxpayers, with ICE reimbursing equipment, vehicles and personnel expenses, though commissioners and others have expressed concern over potential liability costs borne by the county if a raid or arrest goes wrong.

The debate intersects directly with the race for sheriff, between Harran and Ceisler, the Democrat.

Ceisler has been critical of Harran’s ICE collaboration, arguing that it diverts resources, reduces trust and harms public safety. He contends that deputies should focus on county law enforcement duties rather than carrying out federal immigration tasks.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ICE-officer-immigration-immigrant-detainees.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:48.347221

NEW BEDFORD — In response to an uptick in immigration activity and “some community pushback,” Police Chief Jason Thody has issued interim guidance on how the department’s officers should interact with and respond to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they’re in the city.

“One of the main topics right now is immigration enforcement,” Thody said. “The question was, what do we do as the New Bedford Police Department? What’s the direction to the troops on what we do [during] ICE operations?”

‣ Coming tomorrow: How county sheriffs interact with ICE

Among the guidelines, the three-page document states officers must activate their body cameras when responding, and must “fully document” each incident by noting key aspects: whether NBPD was notified by ICE before the operation, what officers observed on scene, and whether any arrests occurred.

It’s a stopgap measure until the department publishes a formal policy, which it is developing with city attorneys.

The guidance addresses how police should interact with protesters who may be on scene or nearby during an ICE operation. It affirms that protesters are allowed to voice their opinion and film (activities protected by the First Amendment), but states New Bedford police must “restore order” if demonstrators interfere with law enforcement operations, block vehicles, create safety hazards, or turn violent.

“Officers should prioritize the safety of everyone involved, including agents, protesters, and bystanders, while balancing lawful order with the public’s right to observe and speak,” it says.

When responding, NBPD will send a supervisor and at least two officers. The supervisors would then be expected to verify the agents are with ICE. If federal agents do not provide that information, Thody said the department will document that, too.

Thody issued the guidance to all police personnel on Sept. 21 and published a public facing FAQ on the police website on Sept. 24.

Chief says ICE has rarely communicated with NB police

The transparency on the Police Department’s end comes amid a lack of transparency from ICE, according to local elected officials — and Thody.

Communication has been inconsistent and the department doesn’t hear much from the federal agency, Thody said. Most of the time, police learn of immigration arrests through the news or social media.

Between July and October, Thody saw one or two calls from ICE to the department’s communications division to inform them that federal agents would be in the city that day. Since July, The Light has confirmed at least 17 ICE arrests in the city. Most arrestees are originally from Guatemala.

Across Massachusetts, ICE has targeted Guatemalans. They rank second, after Brazilians, in the most arrests by country of origin from January through July in the state, according to ICE data.

“It is frustrating to not be able to have conversations that could put our community and our officers in a safer place,” said Thody, who spoke with The Light before and after the guidance was published. “There are a lot of ways I think we could be helpful to both sides without enforcing immigration laws and getting involved.”

Thody said he contacted ICE Boston Field Office Acting Director Patricia Hyde in hopes of having a conversation. He has not heard back.

“We know that they’re going to do what they’re going to do… I can’t control that. But is there a way we can — not work together — but we could create a situation that’s safe for our residents and put our immigrant population at ease,” Thody said, “whether that’s running interference or using deconfliction training.”

Communication with ICE could enhance public safety, Thody argues. Citing the window-smashing incident involving Juan Francisco Méndez in New Bedford in April, Thody said New Bedford police could assist in de-escalating similar situations. They can also offer language skills if ICE officers cannot effectively communicate with the person.

The department employs a K’iche’-speaking officer, as well as those who speak Spanish. The guidance notes this, stating officers can provide “translation services.”

But New Bedford officers may not be able to do that if they are not informed of where and when ICE agents will be operating in the city.

Ondine Gálvez Sniffin, Méndez’s attorney, challenged Thody on this in July when, just after starting the job as chief, he spoke before the immigrant community during a gathering at Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, where Méndez was in attendance.

Gálvez Sniffin said that when New Bedford police officers responded to the scene after Méndez was taken, they told her that “they would not get involved, they would not interfere, in an enforcement action.”

“How are they going to de-escalate the situation?” she asked Thody.

Thody said there is no perfect answer: ”I don’t know that we will be able to help in every situation.”

Still, it’s worth trying, he said.

Critics react

Adrian Ventura, executive director of the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, said the police guidance may well backfire.

“Now, the people are worried that the police are working with Immigration,” he said. “I don’t know anymore if they are protecting the feds or the community.”

The Light has confirmed that ICE has taken nearly 60 immigrants into custody in the New Bedford area since the start of the current presidential administration.

Thody has acknowledged that some members of the city’s Guatemalan community are fearful.

“My philosophy is still not to cooperate with them in their enforcement. I think it is important to know them and have a working relationship with them so that we can be present to help protect our residents,” Thody told a full room at the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores event in July.

New Bedford is not the first or the only police department in Massachusetts to put guidance about ICE interactions in writing. Framingham issued guidance in 2017 and Natick in 2024. Most recently, Georgetown, a town of about 8,000 people in the North Shore, and Easthampton, in Hampshire County, issued their own documents in May and June respectively.

Peter Mancina, a cultural anthropologist and visiting scholar at Rutgers Law School, said local police can exercise discretion in how they cooperate with federal agents.

“There are legitimate public safety concerns and reasons” for police to respond to an operation, Mancina said.

“Nonetheless, it makes it easier for ICE to arrest the person,” he continued. “De-escalation makes people more safe, but it affords ICE a more efficient immigration event, and one that saves their face. They don’t have to look like the aggressors.”

Amy Grunder, director of state government affairs at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA), said she viewed the transparency around Thody’s guidance as a good thing on the whole.

“Some police departments, especially those in immigrant communities, have worked really hard to earn the trust of immigrant residents and are seeing that work undermined by aggressive ICE enforcement,” she said.

Nonetheless, Grunder does have questions about the Police Department’s guidance, particularly about the portions where it emphasizes protecting ICE agents.

“It is concerning, because it does kind of give credence to the idea that ICE agents are at risk from the public,” she said.

“It’s a needless addition that sends a bad message,” added Grunder, “especially given the well documented brutality of these enforcement actions against targeted immigrants and bystanders, including journalists.”

From Thody’s perspective, though, officers on the force will have some expectations and guidance they can refer to, which they didn’t before.

“The important takeaway is that the New Bedford Police Department is not taking a political position on this,” he said. “We don’t pick and choose who to keep safe.”",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2448.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:31.007885

“H-1B,” they responded, looking bewildered. That’s the visa for foreign workers with special expertise.

Nothing that I could see would have attracted the attention of the agents, except for the fact that the men had brown skin. After questioning them, the agents let them go.

This scene is now unfolding across Chicago every day.

Federal immigration agents have been asking people about their legal status outside churches, homeless shelters, apartment buildings, parks and even a cemetery. Officers have questioned both U.S. citizens and legal residents, asking for passports and visas as proof of identity.

The presence of officers from Border Patrol and ICE has brought forth an intense backlash. Chicagoans are shouting at immigration agents, calling them fascists and Nazis, throwing objects at them and chasing their unmarked S.U.V.s or minivans, honking their horns to warn bystanders of ICE’s presence.

In response to what a Homeland Security official called “a surge in assaults,” the officers are using increasingly aggressive tactics. In recent days, they’ve hurled tear gas, pepper balls and smoke bombs at the public, protesters, journalists and even Chicago police officers, often without warning. Today’s newsletter is about the conflict on the streets of Chicago.

The intervention

The Trump administration began a crackdown on illegal immigration here five weeks ago, promising to help the city by arresting “criminal illegal aliens.” But the tactics are unusual.

Schools. Officers are lingering just off campus in some places. So principals have ordered “soft lockdowns,” keeping students in classrooms until the agents are gone. Last month, ICE tried to arrest a father after a day care drop-off; in the confrontation, he was shot and killed. Now some schools use neighborhood volunteers, at parents’ request, so white adults can walk Latino children home.

Restaurants. Kitchens are often staffed by undocumented immigrants, and ICE knows it. Workers are afraid to leave their homes, and many have cut their hours. One Mexican spot I like keeps its door locked — even when it’s open — as a shield against ICE, allowing customers in one at a time.

Public spaces. Many people, even those with legal status, are asking friends to do their grocery shopping for them. Streets are quieter. One man with legal residency got a $130 ticket for not having his papers, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Why here? It is not surprising to people here that the administration has focused on Chicago, which calls itself a sanctuary city. That means it doesn’t help the federal government deport undocumented immigrants. Half a million Chicagoans, nearly one-fifth of the population, were born outside the United States, and support for immigrants is generally strong in the area. Local police officers won’t ask suspects about their immigration status.

Trump and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, have an adversarial relationship, and Trump regularly criticizes Chicago’s Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson. The president wrote online that they “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” City and state leaders said they were receiving no communication from the Department of Homeland Security or the White House about the operations.

The fury over immigration enforcement has expanded in the last few days. After a car chase and crash involving agents, more than 100 people came out of their homes and shouted, “ICE go home.” At least one person threw eggs at the agents, hitting an agent directly in the head. (Trump ordered National Guard troops into Illinois over Pritzker’s objections, but a federal judge blocked their deployment last week.)

In response, federal officers released tear gas on the crowd, including 13 Chicago police officers who had been called to the scene. For weeks, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have dispersed people filming and shouting at them by shooting pepper balls and tear gas.

This is very different from norms of modern policing: Officers typically release chemical agents only in extreme situations, and only after warnings. Agents have pointed guns at people who get in their way.

On Wednesday, Pritzker complained that ICE was causing “mayhem” and warned that other cities would face the same fate. In the Oval Office yesterday, Trump named San Francisco. He said, “We’re just at the start. We’re going to go into other cities.”

ASSAD’S ENFORCERS

No dictator rules alone. For two decades, and amid a 13-year civil war that left half a million people dead, the Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad relied on a network of henchmen to support his rule, writes Christiaan Triebert, a reporter on our Visual Investigations team.

These men tortured civilians. They built and used chemical weapons. They ran drugs that helped fund the government. They ordered the bombing of hospitals. And when the regime fell in December 2024, many of them simply vanished. My colleagues and I set out to uncover evidence of their alleged crimes and find out where they might be now — in Russia, for instance, or plotting revenge from Lebanon.

We chased down fragments of information — a photo of a lavish Damascus home posted to a neighborhood Facebook page, the name of a small village mentioned in a sanctions document, a phone number with a Russian country code discreetly shared with reporters — and added the normal journalistic legwork of reading legal filings, knocking on doors, calling people’s friends, family and co-workers.

This expansion of immigration enforcement into higher education…opens a new chapter in the debate about universities’ responsibility to protect their students.

The term “287(g)” refers specifically to section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The law created a mechanism to facilitate collaboration between federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and local police.

These agreements allow state and local authorities to assume federal immigration control functions and were once rare—as of 2016, at the end of the Barack Obama administration, only 32 law enforcement agencies had active agreements. Today, more than 1,000 state and local agencies have signed on.

Some campus police departments are now also participating in the 287(g) program. This expansion of immigration enforcement into higher education through local law enforcement, although still limited, opens a new chapter in the debate about universities’ responsibility to protect their students.

Campus Police in Florida Join ICE Program

Implementation of section 287(g) requires a memorandum of understanding between ICE and the interested agency, which must agree to training, federal oversight, and specific protocols.

A 287(g) agreement deputizes local agents to verify the immigration status of detained individuals, issue administrative detentions, and assist in deportation proceedings.

Immigrant rights organizations and sectors of the university community are coordinating collective protection strategies.

There are different models of application, including the Jail Enforcement Model, which operates within detention centers, and the Task Force Model, which enables local police to undertake specified ICE functions. Both have raised civil rights concerns due to their potential to encourage racial profiling and the criminalization of immigrant communities.

According to available information, Miami-based Florida International University’s campus police department applied to join the 287(g) program in April 2025 and executed an agreement on July 2. As of July 12, 13 universities in Florida have done the same, including the state’s flagship university, the University of Florida in Gainesville.

Mounting Internal Campus Resistance

Given the risk of surveillance on campus, exacerbated by 287(g) agreements, immigrant rights organizations and sectors of the university community are coordinating collective protection strategies in response.

“Right now, our anti-ICE efforts are pretty new,” said Kassandra Toussaint of Florida International University (FIU), when asked how students and the community have sought to raise awareness about the immigration enforcement role university police would play.

Toussaint, a political science undergraduate student and grassroots organizer at FIU, told NPQ, “Currently, we’re working with the ACLU of Florida for students to get training on being legal observers.”

The purpose of this ACLU-supported training is to ensure that students are equipped to legally observe and document an incident if they see someone being detained by ICE or campus police. Ideally, they can also help facilitate communication between the person being detained and their family.

Toussaint also noted that organizer training sessions are being offered to help students develop practical skills that effectively raise awareness about ICE and the impact of immigration enforcement on campus.

In September, FIU students and faculty gathered in front of the Graham Center, where the university’s President’s Council was meeting, to demand that the agreement not be implemented.

Similar demonstrations took place at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Students argued that the agreement transforms their campus into an environment of surveillance and suppression. Signs with phrases such as “No one should be afraid to learn” accompanied the protests, which were covered by media outlets such as Univision and Telemundo.

Faculty members have also expressed strong opposition to the implementation of these agreements, warning that they will erode trust in campus police and expose students to racial profiling. Immigration advocacy groups and legal experts, such as the ACLU of Florida, concur.

One effect of 287(g) agreements, the ACLU of Florida notes, is to discourage people from reporting crimes, as immigrant victims avoid contacting police out of fear that their immigration status might be questioned or revoked. Even legal residents and people holding valid international student visas still face the very real risk of arrest or deportation.

Tania Cepero López, an associate professor in the FIU English Department and president of the faculty union, told NPQ that building bridges with campus police and leaders to discourage cooperation with ICE can be valuable, even if authorities are initially resistant.

“We have made every effort to maintain consistent communication and collaboration with our chief of police, our students, and our faculty,” she said.

At a public rally in September, Cepero López told the student newspaper Panther NOW, “[The agreement is] creating safety issues on campus that are completely unnecessary. What we’re asking the FIU Police to do is withdraw from the ICE 287(g) agreement, and that the FIU Police does the work of FIU Police, and ICE agents can do the work of ICE agents—there’s no need to conflate the two.”

Thomas Kennedy, an Argentine immigrant graduate student at FIU and spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, emphasized that the agreements are voluntary, telling NPQ that Florida universities are free not to sign them.

“State law is actually quite clear—it only requires counties that operate jails or detention centers, like Miami-Dade or Broward, to sign this type of agreement. Other institutions, such as cities or universities, are not obliged to do so,” Kennedy explained.

An Opportunity Missed

Organizations such as the ACLU, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), and United We Dream have long documented the impacts of 287(g) agreements on immigrant communities and have publicly denounced the program’s contribution to racial profiling, the detention of people without criminal records, and the erosion of trust between residents and local authorities.

Educational exclusion based on immigration status violates fundamental principles of equality and justice.

In June 2023, during the Joe Biden administration, more than 100 organizations—including the ACLU, NILC, and United We Dream—wrote a joint letter to then–Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, calling for all 287(g) agreements to be revoked. The letter noted that “the history of the program is riddled with unlawful forms of racial profiling and stereotyping.”

A year before that, in 2022, the ACLU published a report titled License to Abuse, detailing how the 287(g) program had empowered sheriffs with histories of racism and civil rights violations, becoming a tool for immigration persecution that undermined racial justice and community safety. The report noted that the ACLU had sought to end the 287(g) program for more than a decade due to “the racial profiling, civil rights abuses, and erosion of community trust that it spawned.”

Unfortunately, the Biden administration didn’t heed this call. Since Donald Trump’s inauguration as president in January 2025, the number of agencies participating in 287(g) agreements has increased sixfold.

The Struggle Continues

Educational exclusion based on immigration status violates fundamental principles of equality and justice, but it also affects the quality of education.

As Cepero López emphasized, maintaining academic standards requires that students be safe on campus, free from fears tied to immigration status or documentation.

“We’re trying to communicate to our university that, in order to remain on a path of academic excellence, we must adopt policies that support our international students,” she said. “Policies that allow us to engage with the global community and maintain a safe learning environment.”",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Florida_University_ICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:03.153022

Local residents and longtime business owners alike have been traumatized by immigration agents roaming around the neighborhood, Moreno said, arresting both unauthorized immigrants and US citizens.
A record 14 million unauthorized immigrants, roughly 5.6% of total households, lived in the United States in 2023.
Little Village became a landing spot for Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States beginning in the 1960s and 1970s.
PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.","In Chicago’s Little Village, the Trump administration’s sweeping deportation push has paralyzed the economy.

Business owners in Little Village, which is 81% Hispanic, said customers are too frightened to walk the streets of Chicago’s second busiest commercial corridor. Sales have plunged, employees are staying home, and stores have temporarily closed since the administration’s deportation push in Chicago began on September 8. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the Department of Homeland Security’s “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The economic fallout from deportations is typically focused on the impact to industries with large unauthorized immigrant workforces, such as construction and agriculture. But undocumented immigrants aren’t just people who simply go to work each day. They’re consumers, too. They spent roughly $300 billion in 2023, buying goods and services that power the economy.

“It’s killing business,” said Mike Moreno, the owner of Moreno’s liquor store and speakeasy bar. His father opened the store in Little Village in the 1970s, and it was the first Latino-owned liquor store in Illinois.

He said sales have dropped 60% since September. Local residents and longtime business owners alike have been traumatized by immigration agents roaming around the neighborhood, Moreno said, arresting both unauthorized immigrants and US citizens.

“They’re going up and down the streets around in loops to scare us,” he said. “I never thought in a million years I’d see something like this.”

Marcela Rodriguez, a franchise operator of Los Mangos, a small Mexican-style ice cream chain, said “people are not stepping outside. Kids are not going to school. It’s unbelievable.”

Her business “just completely went downhill” beginning in September, and several fearful employees changed their schedules to prepare food when the store is locked and closed to customers.

Ice cream sales now correlate with how visible immigration agents are in the neighborhood, she said.

“On quiet days with not a lot of detainments, we see an uptick in customers.”

‘Economic lifeline’

The Trump administration said last month it’s on track to deport 600,000 unauthorized immigrants this year.

But that push is hurting businesses and local economies that rely on immigrants, both legal and undocumented, who buy everything from food to cars to homes.

A record 14 million unauthorized immigrants, roughly 5.6% of total households, lived in the United States in 2023. Twenty-six million people live in a household with at least one person who lacks legal status.

Not only does this group spend hundreds of billions annually, they also paid more than $90 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2024, helping fund social services and programs like Social Security. Sales, property, business and other taxes they paid help prop up municipal and state budgets.

That’s why a slowdown in Little Village threatens to have a spillover effect on Chicago. The city may see lower tax revenues from retail sales, as well as store closures, reduced orders along the supply chain, and a hit to the real estate market, said Teresa Córdova, the director of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Little Village became a landing spot for Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. They helped stabilize the neighborhood, which had emptied out as Chicago lost manufacturing jobs and people left for the suburbs.

“Were it not for Latinos in Chicago, we would not be able to revitalize like we did,” Córdova said.

A similar story of immigrants reviving areas in decline played out in many northern industrial cities during the mid-twentieth century and later in the South, said A. K. Sandoval-Strausz, a history professor at Penn State University and author of the book “Barrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City.”

“The influx of immigrants to these neighborhoods has been an economic lifeline,” he said.

But White House spokesperson Kush Desai called looking at how much unauthorized immigrants spend and pay in taxes in isolation an “idiotic exercise” because “the costs that Americans pay due to illegal immigration are incalculable: crime, strained healthcare systems, inflated real estate costs, and schools being overburdened with costly ESL students.”

The White House pointed to research from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower immigration levels, that said American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to cover costs for unauthorized immigrants.

Mazola corn oil and subprime car loans

Immigrants and families unsure of their future in the United States are sending more money to their home countries — remittances to many Latin American countries are seeing double-digit increases — and they’re tightening their wallets.

TD Bank estimated that undocumented workers who are spending less will subtract 0.7 percentage points from consumer spending growth this year.

When Tricolor, a subprime auto lender primarily for unauthorized immigrants in the Southwest, filed for bankruptcy last month, analysts said it was a sign of the pressure on the economy catering to undocumented immigrants.

Major food brands and retailers are also noticing an impact.

PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.

Sales of Mazola corn oil have dropped among Hispanic consumers in the South, parent company Associated British Foods said last month on an earnings call.

“We have a very large share of Hispanic consumers in Mazola, and there’s a lot of fear in that community,” CEO George Weston said. “We really hope that that’s temporary for all sorts of reasons.”

But the administration is ramping up its detention capabilities to reach its goal of one million deportations a year, and Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act triples the budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The further the Trump administration goes, the larger the blow will be to consumer spending, employment and taxes that boost cities and states, said Eric Rodriguez, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights group. Mass deportations have been found to reduce employment and wages for native-born citizens, too.

“There’s no sign that what we’re seeing right now is going to stop or de-escalate,” he said. “As the government builds up mass deportations, the economic effects will be greater.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2233925342.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-16 12:03:13.309876

CHICAGO — If there is one thing to draw hope from amid the descent of federal agents into Chicago over the past month, it’s how Chicagoans far and wide are showing up in support of one another.

Across the city, neighbors are stepping up to help kids get to school safely, picking up groceries for families who fear leaving their homes and raising money to support street vendors and others whose livelihoods have been threatened by the swarm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement patrols.

While it remains unknown how long the increased ICE presence will last — Russell Hott, ICE’s field director in Chicago, told Block Club last week that there was no planned end date — the effect of people showing up for one another will continue to reverberate for just as long, neighbors and organizers said.

Here are a few ways neighbors are supporting their communities — and how you can help, too.

Blowing The Whistle

Residents are equipping themselves with whistles by the thousands, readying neighbors to alert one another if they see ICE agents nearby.

The Little Village Community Council began handing out bright orange whistles during “know your rights” workshops in June, after getting the idea from Los Angeles residents who were reacting to their own city’s immigration raids earlier this year.

“We had the idea of coming out with a whistle so people could hear that noise, and if they don’t have legal status, go the other way — run as quickly as possible to safety and to make sure they don’t open their doors,” said Baltazar Enriquez, president of the Little Village Community Council.

Since then, the idea has spread to other neighborhoods as well; Ravenswood Community Services gathered volunteers Monday evening to assemble 600 whistle kits to pass out to parents and students. Pilsen Arts & Community House has a tutorial how to publish and distribute its one-page whistle zine, which is available along with other printable resources online, and has been handing out whistle kits to local businesses to distribute.

Belmont Cragin United distributed 5,000 whistles at a recent event and is looking to hand out more than 12,000 by the end of October, said organizer Alonso Zaragoza. The organization recently launched Whistlemania, where volunteers assemble and distribute whistle kits across multiple Northwest Side neighborhoods. Each packet includes information on recognizing federal agents and advice from the ACLU, as well as a whistle to alert others in emergencies or during ICE encounters.

Street Vendor Support

The familiar jingle of bells from a paletas cart or a roadside offering of produce have become rarer as Chicago street vendors stay home to protect themselves from ICE.

Vendors around Chicago — from Laura Murillo of Laura’s Tamales to a tamalera in Rogers Park — have been arrested by immigration agents over the past month. In late September, neighbors and organizers pledged they would keep Murillo’s Back of the Yards stand going to support her daughters.

In a matter of weeks, the Street Vendors Association of Chicago has raised $184,000 of its $300,000 goal to provide emergency support to street vendors who are too fearful of ICE raids to go out and sell their wares.

Through her nonprofit organization The Mural Movement, Delilah Martinez launched Operation Buyout, where she and other organizers are “buying out” a vendor’s supply — giving them $500 to $1,000 along with groceries and other necessities. Since July, Operation Buyout has supported Matello’s Bakery in Pilsen, a neighborhood paleta seller, and a woman who sells chocolate in Pilsen.

How you can help: Donate to the Chicago Street Vendor Relief Fund (donations to the nonprofit organization are tax deductible); grab your bike and join CyclingxSolidarity for the Saturday’s Street Vendor Bike Tour in Little Village; attend the Kafecito with Kathy fundraiser Sunday at Latina-owned Tasa Coffee Roasters, 4136 W. North Ave. in Humboldt Park; Donate to Operation Buyout on Venmo (@TheMuralMovement), CashApp ($VaultGallerie) or Zelle or QuickPay (delilah@themuralmovement.org).

Grocery Runs

Monica Gutierrez has called Pilsen home for the majority of her life, but she’s never seen the streets of her neighborhood this empty. It’s disheartening to see the fear, violence and disrespect her community is facing, said Gutierrez, who was raised in an immigrant household.

“ICE is everywhere and doesn’t even allow us a second to breathe or to get where we need,” she said.

When Gutierrez came across Sin Título’s Neighbor to Neighbor program a few weeks ago, she jumped at the opportunity. As a volunteer, Gutierrez goes on grocery runs for community members who are afraid to leave their homes to get the basic necessities.

Sin Título co-founder Iraís Sosa started the program in hopes of creating “more moments of peace” amid the chaos.

But Sosa didn’t anticipate that 100 people would sign up within the first couple hours of opening the volunteer application. Now almost 400 people have applied, Sosa said. It was a “good problem” to have and she quickly figured out a system. The program has been capped at 200 volunteers across the Chicago area to keep it manageable.

After seeing a raid at a bus stop, Sosa also started offering Lyft gift cards for those who don’t feel safe commuting using public transportation.

Applications to receive help or nominate a loved one are still open and available in English and Spanish, Sosa said. Recipients are paired up with a volunteer and can get groceries on a recurring basis as long as funds are available. They have measures in place to ensure privacy, like confirming addresses verbally over the phone as opposed to text or email, she said.

How you can help: While Sin Título isn’t taking more volunteers right now, it is still accepting donations. They’ve raised more than $11,000 since launching the program to cover the cost of groceries and Lyft gift cards.

Cleansing Charity

Cristina Puzio is a curandera — a folk healer — born and raised in Pilsen. After seeing news of Funston Elementary being tear-gassed by federal agents in Logan Square in early October, she felt a need to do something that would honor her community and her culture.

Inheriting practices that were passed down to her from ancestors and mentors, she reached out to Evelyn Medina, owner of the Logan Square gift shop Espacio 3628, to offer “limpias” to the community.

As Puzio puts it, a limpia is a way of cleansing a person’s energy. By removing a person’s negative energies, she hopes to help them let go of burdens they carry.

“Whatever we’re carrying, whether it’s an emotion, a fear, worry,” she said. “If we don’t know how to process it, it can linger, and it can start to affect us on a deeper level.”

The specific limpia she offers is for those living with shock and fear — particularly resonant during the heightened ICE activity. Incorporating obsidian, epazote, basil, Copal, lemons and sacred waters, the ritual lasts for 10 minutes.

Cristina will continue to collaborate with Espacio 3628 and provide limpias to Logan Square residents and surrounding communities — the next event is set for Tuesday.

How you can help: Attend the next limpias fundraiser at the Logan Square shop, 3628 W. Armitage Ave., from 2:30-6 p.m. Tuesday. Espacio 3628 is also accepting donations to continue handing out whistles and Know Your Rights cards, and organizing watch patrols during neighborhood school drop-offs and pickups.

School Safety

In Belmont Cragin, school attendance has dropped by as much as 10 percent as families worry that ICE agents will show up during drop-off and pickup, said Alonso Zaragoza, who serves on a Local School Council along with his work with Belmont Cragin United.

A new “walking school bus” program aims to provide a sense of security for families as they go to and from school, Zaragoza said. Seven or eight volunteers will position themselves along school routes, mirroring Safe Passage routes established by Chicago Public Schools. Similar corner watches have launched in Irving Park and Albany Park on the Northwest Side, as well.

“It’s about having bodies out around the school, keeping an eye out and making sure everybody’s safe,” Zaragoza said. “So that the kids who haven’t been going to school in the last couple weeks feel comfortable enough to come back and finish their education.”

After early challenges, the community-led effort is gaining traction as educators and parents work together. “Now the pieces of organizing are starting to fall into place,” Zaragoza said. “Everybody’s clicking together.”

To maintain a sense of community and safety, Belmont Cragin United is continuing with events like its seventh annual “Trunk or Treat,” while also training neighbors through the Rapid Response Network to verify reports of ICE presence. He said the effort is about accuracy and care, as the group doesn’t publish anything unverified and works to keep neighbors informed.

He emphasized that all of this work is entirely community-led. “There’s no taxpayer money being involved in this. No elected official has offered to pay for this,” he said. “People need to be informed.”

How you can help: Volunteer with the Belmont Cragin United Rapid Response Network to help verify ICE activity and distribute know your rights materials; donate safety whistles, candy, or printing materials for the upcoming Trunk or Treat community event.

Turning Art Into Action

As reports of ICE raids began spreading through Chicago’s Latino neighborhoods, photographer Mari Trancoso said she felt a growing urgency to help.

“I just keep feeling this burn in my chest,” she said. “Like this angry cry wants to come out, and I just feel like I’m not doing what I need to do.”

Trancoso lives about 1½ hours west of Chicago in Dixon, but she has been photographing weddings and families across Chicago for nearly a decade.

Using her photography business and online following, she created a fundraising campaign called Art as an Offering. Proceeds from mentoring sessions, photo editing customizations known as presets and educational PDFs were given to five Chicago organizations: Instituto del Progreso Latino, ICIRR, Pilsen Food Pantry, Street Vendors Association of Chicago, and Sin Título.

“I wanted to offer something reachable for other people, not just photographers,” she said. Lower-priced resources, starting at $15, were designed to make donating accessible, and clients booking future photo sessions with Trancoso can also opt to have part of their payment directed toward the groups.

Though she has mostly used her platform for awareness in the past, this effort feels more personal — and more urgent — than before. “My family is from Mexico — my grandma is from Zacatecas, and I have cousins who are not white-passing, and are in fear,” she said. “I felt like I had this privilege that I could do more things since I don’t have that same fear as they do.”

For others who want to help, Trancoso encourages using social media to share verified information or volunteering for organizations already embedded in neighborhoods. She cited Sin Titulo as an example, noting that “even simple things like running errands for Latino families who are too scared to go out in public are very valuable.”

Wallet Warriors

Pilsen streets have been emptier than usual, and Becky Lehmann took note during a recent visit to the neighborhood. At times, she was the only customer at some of the businesses she stepped in, she said.

Lehmann, who lives in Edgewater, wanted to help, so she posted an Instagram video calling on people to support the businesses in Hispanic neighborhoods still reeling from the increased ICE presence.

“When I boil it all down, it’s just what I can do to be kind,” she said.

In the video, Lehmann encourages people to pick a neighborhood that they know is being targeted and go and contribute to the local businesses that are hurting. If they see something happening, they can record and share.

She frames it as something anyone can do. “Resistance doesn’t have to be big and noisy,” she says in the video. “It can be walking into a shop and buying a cat figurine from a neighbor.”

Others have also made the call for Chicagoans to support immigrant-owned businesses. The Hermosa Belmont Cragin Chamber of Commerce shared a list of neighborhood businesses to support. Lost Girls Vintage put out a call for commenters to share their favorite South and West side businesses. Zaragoza said Belmont Cragin has been slowly recovering from the pandemic, rebuilding its business community. But the ICE raids have caused renewed fear and kept many from dining out or even leaving their homes, he said.

“The dining scene in our neighborhoods has been decimated because of it,” he said. The neighborhood will host a Taste of Belmont Cragin event Oct. 28, with a route through four restaurants and participating street vendors.

How you can help: Many neighborhoods have chambers of commerce listing local businesses to help you plan your visit. You can also sign up by Oct. 24 to participate in the Nov. 8 Abuelita Hot Chocolate 5K Walk/Run in Riis Park in Belmont Cragin on Nov. 8 — money raised will go toward neighborhood businesses.

Cook County includes Chicago, which has seen a federal immigration crackdown in recent months.

Detaining residents outside court has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July. Representatives said they’ve seen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed a petition this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations. It also has drawn lawsuits from some states and the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Asked about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done, because what’s happening with these ICE agents and courthouses and territories around courthouses is unacceptable,” Welch said. “People are afraid to go to court. They’re afraid to comply with subpoenas. We can’t allow that. These should be safe spaces.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed street chase on Chicago’s South Side.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events citywide and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three detained recently.",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2024/09/generic-legal-image-gavel-and-books-dark-brown.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:57.483053

Since Donald Trump took office, at least 15 people have died in immigration detention.","A 39-year-old man died in hospital alone, miles from his family, after being detained by US immigration officials.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, who had lived in the US since he was four, fell ill while in an immigration detention centre in California.

He complained of a fever and had a persistent cough in the weeks before he died, according to his mother Lucia.

She said he was initially treated by medical staff inside the detention centre but was returned to his cell.

He was eventually taken to hospital for a scheduled surgery to remove an abscess on his buttocks, but died before he was able to have the operation.

His family were never told he was in hospital, learning of his death via a knock on the door from police.

""They're the ones that notified us that he had passed,"" his brother, Jose Ayala, told Sky News.

""We were not even aware that he was in the hospital or even had a scheduled surgery. Then we got a knock on our door a little after 5.30 one morning.

""I believe he would still be alive today if he was never detained. He got sick while in detention, and they did not seem to take care of him.""

Why was he detained?

Mr Ayala-Uribe's death raises questions about the conditions inside the centre he was held in, and if a sudden surge of immigrants being detained by this administration has left the system stretched beyond breaking point.

He had moved to the US from Mexico with his family as a child.

He did have DACA - deferred action for childhood arrivals - status, granted to those who have arrived while under the age of 18. But this was removed in 2016, after he was convicted of drink-driving.

In August, he was arrested by immigration agents at a car wash in California where he had worked for 15 years.

He was held for five weeks at Adelanto, a privately owned, run-for-profit, immigrant detention centre. A lawyer for his family said he was, as far as they are aware, a healthy man before he was detained and had no medical need.

But Mr Ayala-Uribe's mother, who was visiting him every eight days and speaking to him on the phone a couple of times a day, said she noticed him getting progressively unwell.

""He started with lots of fever,"" Ms Ayala said. ""He said they weren't listening to him. The last time I saw him his face was drained, he told me he was not OK, he told me he couldn't take it any more.""

Beginning to cry, wiping away tears, she added: ""I feel powerless that I couldn't do anything to help my son.

""I never imagined I was going to bury one of my sons. It feels terrible, they took a piece of my heart away.

""I would like something to change. If we cannot save him, at least we can save others that are still inside.""

ICE defends detention treatment

The cause of Mr Ayala-Uribe's death is still under investigation.

Sky News requested comment from the company which owns the detention centre where he was held, and they deferred to ICE, the US immigration and customs enforcement agency.

In a statement, ICE said: ""Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.

""At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergency care.""

The Trump administration says it's targeting criminals and people in the US illegally. But campaigners say Mr Ayala-Uribe's death should not be viewed in isolation.

Since Donald Trump took office, at least 15 people have died in immigration detention.

Democrat senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote a letter to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, asking for more information about these deaths.

The senators claimed 10 people had died between January and June, and that it was the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

Sarah Houston, a lawyer for the Immigrant Defenders Law Centre, claims immigrants are being mistreated in custody.

""This administration's main goal is to harm, to torture individuals and to try to force them out,"" she said.

""The great increase we see in human rights abuses, in deaths, is a direct result of the administration's decision to pack these detention centres as much as they can.""

Mr Ayala-Uribe's funeral was held this week. Dozens of extended family and friends wore t-shirts bearing his face. A mariachi band played as his casket was lowered into the ground and his mother heaved with sobs.

Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, this week demanded an investigation into Noem’s use of public resources to create and promote a partisan video.","Since Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has embraced camera-ready tactics and performative politics to an almost cartoonish degree, few were surprised when she started airing taxpayer-financed ads earlier this year, starring the South Dakota Republican and thanking Donald Trump for his administration’s anti-immigration crackdown.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a sequel of sorts: The new video — also paid for with American tax dollars and also featuring Noem in a starring role — was designed to run in domestic airports. But instead of focusing on immigration, this clip blames congressional Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown.

Almost immediately, the DHS secretary confronted a problem she should’ve seen coming: Airport administrators said they wouldn’t show Noem’s partisan video to air travelers. The list of airports refusing to go along with the Republican’s plan continues to grow. The Associated Press reported:

Airports big and small around the country are refusing to play a video with a message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on Transportation Security Administration operations. Airports in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Phoenix, Seattle and more say the video’s political content goes against their policies or regulations prohibiting political messaging in their facilities.

In fact, there are dozens of airports of various sizes in the state of New York, and according to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, Noem’s video has been “banned” from all of them.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, this week demanded an investigation into Noem’s use of public resources to create and promote a partisan video.

In a letter to acting special counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell wrote, “When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem’s video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration’s political opponents, convince Americans to blame ‘Democrats in Congress’ for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives.”

It’s easy to imagine a hypothetical video in which a homeland security secretary offers the public worthwhile information about how the shutdown might affect air travelers. That sort of message might actually help the public at a difficult time.

The appeals court rejected the U.S. Justice Department’s argument that a Supreme Court emergency docket decision from May was a predictor that the government would defeat the legal challenge on the merits.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president.","Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges.

In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.

The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.

“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.

Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.

The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.

The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions.

Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019.

The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.

Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”

Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.

WASHINGTON — United We Dream (UWD), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Abundant Futures Fund (AFF), have joined forces to launch the Defending Our Neighbors Fund: a bold new initiative that will scale up crucial financial support to legal organizations all across the country. Housed within AFF, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund will help ensure immigrant families facing the threat of separation and wrongful detention and deportations have access to lawyers.

Already, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund has raised over $10 million with the goal of raising a total of at least $30 million in emergency response funding. With more than 11 million U.S. citizens living in households with an undocumented family member, countless American families face imminent risk of being torn apart. Many are forced to navigate a complex and punishing system alone, without access to legal counsel. Even young children, the most vulnerable members of our communities, are facing trained prosecutors without anyone by their side. Access to legal support is a vital lifeline for families facing the threat of being separated from their loved ones.

By surging much-needed financial support to trusted organizations already providing legal assistance to communities in need, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund helps protect everyone’s right to due process, ensure families can stay together, and increase access to high-quality legal representation and, when possible, bond assistance.

Greisa Martinez Rosas, Executive Director of United We Dream, said:

“When I was 17, my father was deported and my family separated forever. That loss isn’t just personal — it is systemic and intentional, with thousands of people rendered vulnerable to mass deportation and family separation with zero access to the legal representation they deserve. I’ve spent every day since organizing and building our community’s collective power so we can protect the future of millions of American families that, just like my own, face the threat of separation.

""The Defending Our Neighbors Fund is about more than fighting for legal representation — it’s a vehicle for everyday people to move from empathy to action, from charity to solidarity in defense of their immigrant neighbors. This Fund is an opportunity for neighbors to stand with neighbors in fighting for a democracy that protects all of us.

""Together, we must invest in the infrastructure of justice - collective power, collective care and legal support. We invite everyone — philanthropists, organizers, and all our neighbors— to build with us. Donate to the Defend our Neighbors Fund.”

Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU, said:

“Deportations without due process, unjust detention, and family separation are attacks on bedrock Constitutional rights and all of our communities. The current moment calls for bold, innovative solutions to meet the most urgent needs of our immigrant neighbors and loved ones, and the Defending Our Neighbors Fund is doing just that. The Fund is the antidote to these harmful attacks, and now more than ever, we, the people, must take action to fight back.”

Chiqui Sanchez Kennedy, Executive Director of the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project (GHIRP), said:

“In March, we faced a comprehensive attack on immigrant children when legal lifelines were eliminated. In a single week, the government abruptly shut down funding for lawyers for unaccompanied children and placed children on “rocket dockets” where toddlers to pre-teens were forced to appear alone in court on an unprecedented, expedited timeline. With no notice, we were forced to halt representation for hundreds of children who depend on our advocacy. We were faced with the impossible choice of continuing to represent our clients without funding or abruptly withdrawing representation, leaving our clients vulnerable to further harm, exploitation and trafficking. Funding from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund was a lifeline for our clients, our staff, and the organization. It enabled us to find a path forward which included meeting the needs of our young clients and upholding our ethical duties as lawyers.”

Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Américas Immigrant Advocacy Center:

“As hostility towards immigration groups continues, Las Américas lost major funding and faced difficult layoffs. Support from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund arrived at a critical moment. It helped us avoid deeper cuts, keep experienced staff on board, and respond quickly to urgent cases, including access to people detailed at new sites like Camp East Montana at Ft. Bliss.

""This funding came at a moment when everything felt uncertain. It meant we could keep showing up for people in detention, for families navigating impossible systems, and for a community that depends on us. In this environment, staying open isn’t guaranteed. Support like this lets us keep the doors open when our community needs us most.”

Mary Meg McCarthy, Executive Director of the National Immigrant Justice Center:

""The National Immigrant Justice Center has fought to continue providing life-saving legal services since this year's termination of federal programs that reached some of the most vulnerable people in the immigration system, including children who came to the United States alone to seek refuge. Support from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund has been critical to ensure NIJC can still provide counsel for immigrants who face a growing threat of being disappeared into the detention system and removed from the country without due process. In this midst of widespread family separations, the need for new funding streams for legal services is more urgent than ever.""

Throughout my reporting, I — like many journalists in the midst of an intense and complex story — wondered: Was I accurately capturing the facts? I knew that the people around Trump often justified working in his administration by saying they would serve as guardrails against his most extreme impulses, but how could I know for sure that these checks on his power were actually the force holding him back?

I had those doubts because we, as reporters, very rarely get to see the counterfactual, to test our reporting by witnessing how the world would play out if the circumstances were different.

But Trump’s second term has given us that unique opportunity.

The people who sought to restrain the president back then, like his former chief of staff John Kelly and his White House counsel Donald McGahn II, are gone, and so are the hypotheticals. We are now seeing how a truly unshackled Trump uses his power.

Nine months into Trump’s second term, he has done several things he was stopped from doing during his first term. He has exerted more direct pressure on the Justice Department to bring charges, apparently spurring prosecutors to secure an indictment against at least one target who eluded him during his first term. And he has greatly expanded presidential powers, including by deploying the military on domestic soil in more sweeping ways than he did during his first term.

In tonight’s newsletter, I’ll explain what Trump’s second term has taught us about his first: The guardrails worked, up to a point. (See: Jan 6.)

And many of the stark warnings about what would happen without them — which were issued loudly during the presidential campaign by the very people who had once sought to restrain the president — have proved true.

An eye on the Justice Department

As early as 2017, Trump tried to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prosecute his rivals, like Hillary Clinton. But Sessions and top administration aides managed to distract Trump for months. Sessions held onto his job for nearly two years, and no charges were brought against Clinton.

At the time, Trump himself was under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller III for obstructing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump complained endlessly about why his own Justice Department was investigating him, casting a cloud over his presidency, without looking into his perceived enemies.

As the pressure built on Trump, he became more fixated on the idea of not only prosecuting his rivals, including the former F.B.I. director James Comey, but siccing the I.R.S. on them.

Repeatedly, Kelly and McGahn managed to stop Trump. They refused to order the Justice Department to investigate his rivals, telling him that what he wanted to do was potentially illegal. McGahn even wrote Trump an extraordinary memo in which he warned him that he could be defeated at the ballot box — or impeached — if he tried to meddle in prosecutions.

The Justice Department’s prosecutorial decisions remained insulated from the president. While many of his perceived enemies came under investigation, none were ever charged. This left Trump angry, convinced that his aides and political appointees had wrongly constrained him.

Trump’s allies pledged that if he ever returned to the White House, he would not have guardrails like Kelly around to try to stop him.

During the 2024 campaign, Kelly, other top generals who worked for Trump and other former aides issued a series of stark warnings. They said that not only would Trump follow through on prosecuting his rivals but he would use the military domestically on Americans. And, they said, Trump would use his power in audacious and potentially illegal ways to achieve his political goals and erode the independence of bedrock institutions of American democracy.

Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, echoed those warnings on the campaign trail.

Republicans pooh-poohed the warnings, saying that the former officials were just castoffs suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

An expansion of power

Since returning to office, Trump has largely done exactly what Kelly and the former aides warned he would. He has engaged in an aggressive retribution campaign. He has pierced the Justice Department’s prosecutorial decision-making process by publicly and privately telling Attorney General Pam Bondi — including in an apparently accidentally sent private message on Truth Social — whom to charge, including Comey.

Bondi’s department charged Comey five days later, shortly after pushing out a prosecutor who had raised concerns about a potential case against Comey. An indictment against the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, a Democrat who sued Trump for fraud, followed soon after.

Trump has deployed the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to several American cities run by Democratic mayors over their objections. He has dismantled large parts of the federal bureaucracy and work force, challenging Congress’s control over spending. And his administration’s responses to some high-profile court rulings related to immigration issues have raised questions about whether they are following judges’ orders.

For this piece, I reached out to Kelly to see if he would talk about how his warnings lined up with the way Trump has governed. But Kelly declined to comment. Since Trump won, he has said little publicly, believing he already warned the country and there is nothing left for him to say.

Many of the incidents in this story, including Moreta-Galarza’s, have been reported by CNN and authorities confirmed ICE agents were involved, with eyewitness videos showing the sometimes violent nature of the arrests.

Johnson said he’s concerned the impact will undercut the legitimacy and authority of local and state agencies long after federal agents leave communities.
For people on the receiving end of harsher ICE tactics – such as Moreta-Galarza in New York – the experience can be re-traumatizing and fuel mistrust.","A masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent grabbed Monica Moreta-Galarza’s hair as she clung to her husband, pleading with the agents who were detaining him. She was wrestled away from him as her crying children were held back by other agents.

Moreta-Galarza was taken to a nearby room for an unknown period before she was seen in videos captured by onlookers in the hallway of an immigration courthouse in Manhattan in late September, telling a different federal agent in Spanish: “You guys don’t care about anything!”

The agent, wearing a flannel shirt and baseball cap, replies, “Adios, adios,” as he grabs the mother and forces her several feet down the hallway, shoving her into the wall before pushing her to the ground.

Moreta-Galarza was rushed to the hospital for possible head trauma.

Her experience is a snapshot of an array of incidents nationwide caught on camera by bystanders, revealing heavy-handed tactics by federal agents since President Donald Trump took office in January, experts told CNN. Videos over the months have shown ICE agents wearing face coverings and plainclothes, driving unmarked cars and swarming worksites and streets during their deportation operations. Tensions flared again in Chicago this week when an immigration operation resulted in a crash, bringing anger from residents and tear gas.

Many of the incidents in this story, including Moreta-Galarza’s, have been reported by CNN and authorities confirmed ICE agents were involved, with eyewitness videos showing the sometimes violent nature of the arrests.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN federal agents are facing “smearing” by claims the agency is using “harsher approaches,” and said they “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”

Echoing past statements DHS has made after many of the incidents, the agency said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst” and agents are facing a surge in attacks against them. Last month, investigators said a shooter targeted ICE officers at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and injuring another.

ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.

Pressures to meet deportation goals are fueling aggressive tactics, experts say

Former Homeland Security officials and immigration experts argue the aggressive tactics are a result of the immense pressure on immigration agents to ramp up arrests of undocumented immigrants as the administration tries to meet its deportation goals. Historically, the agencies charged with those arrests, like ICE, have been strained, making White House-imposed goals more difficult to meet. The administration says it’s a whole government effort.

Officers from other federal agencies, such as the FBI and CBP, the agency responsible for border security, have also been pulled into immigration enforcement efforts, flooding the streets of blue cities such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC and Chicago.

Law enforcement sources told CNN the increasingly aggressive tactics they’ve observed from immigration agents in recent months have led to confrontations between DHS and agents from other federal agencies working on joint task forces.

John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, said the tactics are not aimed at fighting criminality – they’re designed to increase overall arrests.

“You don’t arrest people in immigration court … who are on stays of removal unless you’re looking for cheap, fast and easy arrests,” said Sandweg, who remains in contact with current ICE and DHS personnel.

In cases like Moreta-Galarza’s, a good agent can still carry out their mission while treating people with “dignity and respect,” said Sandweg.

“Of course she’s going to have that reaction,” he said, “you just arrested her husband and the father of her children … maybe not to be seen in this country ever again.”

While DHS has largely doubled down on its defense of the tactics ICE agents have been using in many of the incidents captured on video, the agency condemned the actions of the agent who shoved Moreta-Galarza and “relieved him of his current duties,” calling his actions “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE.”

It’s unclear whether the officer is still employed by ICE. The agency did not respond to CNN’s questions about disciplinary actions against the officer, his current status or his name.

ICE and CBP resources freed up after drop in border crossings

Illegal border crossings reached “all-time lows” in July, DHS said, which allowed resources at ICE and CBP to be freed up, according to Sandweg. ICE has also referenced the steep decline in border crossings as a reason its agents are now “focused on the core mission.”

ICE is slated to receive a landmark $75 billion in federal funds through 2029 from the president’s sweeping agenda bill for detention expansion and enforcement and removal operations, including hiring new agents, CNN has reported.

The surge in agency resources comes at a time when ICE is aggressively trying to recruit more agents. This could make even more agents available, as they were previously tied up dealing with border cases or spending hours, sometimes days, pursuing one arrest and quietly working with local authorities to target “truly the worst of the worst,” said Sandweg.

Over the past decade, Sandweg said enhanced border activity and asylum claims were “an incredible strain on ICE resources,” as agents had their hands full with taking people into custody, processing, supervising and removing many of the migrants who were apprehended at the border.

Now, ICE and CBP resources are more available to bolster non-border operations, Sandweg said.

Both agencies have been involved in large-scale deportation efforts unfolding in areas previously protected from immigration enforcement, such as schools, churches and courthouses, which hinge on the Trump administration’s decision to roll back a 2011 policy preventing immigration enforcement in sensitive areas.

None of those operations would be possible, according to Sandweg, if border crossings hadn’t fallen drastically since last summer when former President Joe Biden issued an executive action barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a threshold of average daily crossings is met.

Trump officials have said the differing tactics stem from so-called “sanctuary policies” that have been around since the 1980s in many Democratic-controlled areas that limit prisons and jails from cooperating with ICE, so immigration arrests take place in the community rather than at a detention facility.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly cited sanctuary policies as disruptive to immigration enforcement – and threatened to have an increased presence in those cities. Homan, a veteran of immigration law enforcement, also served under the Obama administration.

Most detained immigrants don’t have serious criminal convictions, data shows

As the second Trump administration shifts how ICE has traditionally operated, Sandweg says the range of ICE’s tactics aimed at hiking up arrests and driving migrants to self-deport is working to build an agency “designed to amp up immigration enforcement to levels we’ve never seen in this country.”

While DHS did not specifically address CNN’s request for comment about whether its tactics are designed to maximize arrests, the agency said in its statement it was targeting violent criminals, including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles and rapists.

Federal data reveals most immigrants taken into custody don’t have serious criminal convictions, according to a report by CNN Investigates. More than 75% of people booked into ICE custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, according to ICE records from October through the end of May.

ICE has launched large-scale raids at worksites like Home Depot parking lots in various cities and the Hyundai Metaplant in a small southeast Georgia community last month – assisted by CBP and other federal and state agencies. Nearly 500 people, mostly Korean nationals, who worked at the manufacturing plant were arrested on suspicions they were living and working illegally in the US.

Undocumented people who have not been convicted of any crime and have been arrested in raids like the one at Hyundai have become “collateral” in the larger mission to fight criminality, says Jerry Robinette, former ICE Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge during the Obama administration who also worked for the agency under President George W. Bush.

These people get caught when an officer checks their status and discovers they’re in the country illegally, which is a civil – not criminal – offense, he added.

“As much as they want to target the worst of the worst, you look at who you end up arresting. You’re not being as successful as you would like,” Robinette said. “You are getting a lot of collateral.”

More extensive immigration raids, like the one at Hyundai, are coming, Trump’s border czar told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union: “The short answer is yes, we’re going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan replied.

Protests over immigration actions escalate into clashes

Children and adults were pulled from their homes as federal agents raided an apartment complex in Chicago last month, arresting 37 undocumented immigrants in another recent, large-scale raid.

DHS said gang members and violent criminals were among those arrested, the agency said in its statement.

It’s just one example that shows the tactics fueling protests for weeks outside the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear protesters, putting tensions on full display.

Protests at the site this month again turned into heated clashes between protesters and armed agents from CBP and ICE, leading to at least 18 arrests, including five who were charged with aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction.

In the Chicago apartment raid, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is investigating claims children were separated from their parents and “zip-tied,” as well as elderly people who were detained for three hours, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN’s Jake Tapper.

DHS rejected Pritzker’s claims in a news release, saying children were never zip-tied in the raid and added the agency has “routinely debunked the absurd claim” that it’s targeting US citizens.

The type of aggression from federal agents the public is witnessing in many of these recent incidents has some similarities to the 1950s-era federal program aimed at mass deportations, known as “Operation Wetback” under then-President Dwight Eisenhower, according to Jean Reisz, co-director of the University of Southern California Immigration Clinic.

The Trump administration is echoing rhetoric from that era, referring to immigrants “as being ‘the worst of the worst,’ as being dangerous, as being invaders,” Reisz said, which empowers agents in the streets to “use aggression toward those who could be viewed as resisting.”

The public fury this year over how ICE is operating is rooted in how the Trump administration is pushing the boundaries of various individual rights — such as birthright citizenship — that have been protected for over 60 years, Reisz said. Just last month, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the president’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.

DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about the comparison with the 1950s-era federal program.

This summer, tensions reached a tipping point during weeks of protests in Los Angeles after a wave of detentions in the city, when protesters’ confrontations with local police and federal officers escalated into violent clashes that prompted a controversial, federal deployment of National Guard troops. Federal agents used flash-bangs and tear gas to disperse crowds, with some hitting demonstrators, as well as protesters setting fire to self-driving cars.

Robinette said the “optics” of the tactics federal immigration agents have been using are “not good for us as an agency,” but they are a result of officers having to follow orders from top administration officials and confrontations with people resisting as they execute the orders.

The political pressures on ICE have caused “a lot of headaches” as it deals with protesters who don’t just have issues with the agency but are also driven by political grievances related to the Trump administration, Robinette said. “The job is getting difficult.”

The sweeping raids have instilled a “persistent mental anxiety” within the immigrant community when encountering local police or National Guard troops who might report them to federal immigration officers, said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock with the National Immigration Law Center.

“Even if you’ve got your papers, even though you’re a US citizen, you kind of have to check over your shoulder and that’s having a pretty negative impact on people mentally,” Whitlock said. “And then that translates to a fear or flight response that happens when you do encounter them.”

Officer anonymization fuels public mistrust

Scenes from some of the incidents captured on video in recent months have shown federal agents wearing masks or plainclothes while arresting people — something they have historically done only while performing undercover work or arresting some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, experts say.

In Los Angeles, masked agents were seen yanking a Colombian immigrant out of her vehicle and detaining her on the ground. In Washington, DC, video showed masked federal agents struggling to arrest a man before he appears to be tased and subdued on the pavement. In Massachusetts, Turkish national and Tufts University grad student Rümeysa Öztürk was physically restrained by six plainclothes officers, most of whom were wearing face coverings.

There is no federal policy dictating when officers can or should cover their faces during arrests. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said federal officers are covering up to protect their families after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.

“I am sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I’m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, and their family on the line, because people don’t like what immigration enforcement is,” Lyons said.

But there is a risk of escalating encounters when people can’t identify them as federal agents, said Jeffrey Swartz, a Cooley Law School professor and former prosecutor and judge.

“We’ve never tolerated people who are engaged in law enforcement, who keep who they are and their identification secret from the people who might have complaints about the way they’re being treated,” said Swartz. “Police officers have always identified themselves.”

DHS said the “vilification” of ICE “must stop,” claiming its agents are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them since Trump took office in January. ICE noted “criminal illegal aliens” have targeted its federal agents in the past.

A review of federal court records by Colorado Public Radio, however, revealed a 25% increase in people facing charges for assault against federal officers through mid-September, as compared to the same period last year.

When asked by CNN whether ICE is giving any directives for its agents to wear face coverings, DHS said: “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves and their families from being targeted” by gangs, murderers, rapists and other violent criminals.

Strong federal presence in cities impacts public ‘psyche’

The Trump administration is on pace to deport nearly 600,000 people by the end of Trump’s first year of his second term, DHS said late last month. It is not clear what the breakdown of deportations is by agency.

Including the 71,400 deportations recorded by ICE between October 2024 and the end of December before Trump took office, ICE was already on pace to surpass 300,000 deportations by September 30 – the highest number recorded in a single fiscal year since the Obama administration, when around 316,000 people were removed in fiscal year 2014, CNN reported. CBP recorded more than 132,000 deportations this year.

The agency said 70% of ICE arrests are “of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges in the US.”

Former ICE officials, like Sandweg and Robinette, worry about the long-term impact on the agency because of the pressures they’re facing this Trump term.

Sandweg says the lasting impact could be “devastating” for an agency that has historically worked as a close and quiet partner of state and local law enforcement.

With agents now working side-by-side with local agencies participating in the revived 287(g) program – allowing ICE to authorize state and local law enforcement officers to perform specific immigration enforcement duties under its supervision – it’s fueling tensions with local leaders, who have expressed concerns about ICE overstepping or keeping them in the dark.

“My biggest concern is … what’s going to happen for the future of the agency?” Robinette said. “This agency, since its birth, has never gone through anything like this.”

The strong presence of federal officers in communities has “impacted the psyche of the American public,” deterring people from engaging with local and federal authorities, fracturing trust and instilling fear and uncertainty, said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, an independent nonpartisan organization.

Johnson said he’s concerned the impact will undercut the legitimacy and authority of local and state agencies long after federal agents leave communities.

For people on the receiving end of harsher ICE tactics – such as Moreta-Galarza in New York – the experience can be re-traumatizing and fuel mistrust. After she was pushed and shoved by the ICE agent, the mother told reporters she fled violence in Ecuador only to suffer “the same thing” in the US.

She and her family have open asylum claims, according to US Rep. Dan Goldman, who added they are here “lawfully but are being targeted by ICE regardless.”

“They encircled us, then they slammed me against the floor, they grabbed my kids and dragged them away,” Moreta-Galarza told CNN affiliate WXTV. “They slammed me against the floor and caused my head to slam against the floor. Everyone from ICE fell on top of me.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2236977421-blurred.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-16 10:04:13.585879

He contends that his release under conditional parole means he is no longer subject to expedited removal proceedings and that his detention under §1225(b)(1) is therefore unlawful.
The act of parole extinguished the legal fiction that a non-citizen who is physically present in the United States has, in fact, not effected an entry into the United States.
Congress provided a mechanism for paroling applicants for admission into the United States without changing their status.","Where a petitioner has requested habeas corpus relief, the petition should be granted because the petitioner is being detained without lawful authority, as non-citizens who have been conditionally paroled into the United States are entitled to discretionary detention and a bond hearing under 8 U.S.C. §1226(a), not mandatory detention under 1225(b).

“This is a habeas petition that concerns the government’s authority to hold a non-citizen pending removal proceedings. Petitioner Carlos Roberto De Andrade is a citizen of Brazil who entered the United States illegally in 2021. He was arrested, detained, and placed into expedited removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1). He was then — in apparent violation of that statute, which requires mandatory detention — released on conditional parole under §1226(a).

“Petitioner later moved to Massachusetts and married a United States citizen. In 2025, ICE arrested him when he reported for a routine check-in. The government contends that he is subject to mandatory detention under §1225(b)(1), notwithstanding his parole four years ago under §1226(a) and his undisputed compliance with the conditions of that parole. He contends that his release under conditional parole means he is no longer subject to expedited removal proceedings and that his detention under §1225(b)(1) is therefore unlawful.

“For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees with petitioner, and that he is therefore being detained without lawful authority. …

“By releasing petitioner under conditional parole, the government failed to reserve its right to treat petitioner ‘in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.’ 8 U.S.C. §1182(d)(5)(A). The act of parole extinguished the legal fiction that a non-citizen who is physically present in the United States has, in fact, not effected an entry into the United States. And once having entered, petitioner can no longer be treated as an ‘applicant for admission’ subject to expedited removal and mandatory detention under §1225. He must be treated like any other unlawfully ‘present’ non-citizen — and the lawfulness of his detention is governed by 8 U.S.C. §1226.

“In substance, the government asks the Court to turn a blind eye to the circumstances of petitioner’s release and the events of the last four years. It contends that his ‘release was not an admission to the United States and did not change his status as an applicant for admission subject to expedited removal.’ … But petitioner has been residing in Massachusetts since 2021. He is not seeking parole into the United States. He was already conditionally paroled into the United States. And he is still here. Congress provided a mechanism for paroling applicants for admission into the United States without changing their status. … The government elected not to use that mechanism. It cannot now turn back the clock, and neither can the Court. …

“In short, this Court joins the many other courts in this district and across the country that have found that non-citizens who have been conditionally paroled into the United States are entitled to discretionary detention and a bond hearing under §1226(a), not mandatory detention under 1225(b). …

“Here, the petitioner does not seek — at least in this petition — the right to stay in the country. He instead seeks release pending further immigration proceedings. And while he may ‘remain subject to arrest, detention, and removal’ under §§1226(a) and 1229a(e)(2), he is not subject to detention under §1225(b)(1).

“‘The burden of proof of showing deprivation of rights leading to unlawful detention is on the petitioner.’ Espinoza v. Sabol, 558 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir. 2009). The Court finds petitioner has met his burden. Because he cannot be detained under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1), and respondents have not established an alternative authority for detention, he is being held unlawfully. The Court will therefore grant his petition for release. …

“Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §2241 is granted. Respondent Antone Moniz, the warden of the Plymouth County Correctional Facility, is hereby ordered to release petitioner from custody immediately.”

“As brief background, Petitioner, a citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection in 2020. He has since lived in Massachusetts. In September 2024, a U.S. Border Patrol agent apprehended Petitioner driving a passenger who had just unlawfully crossed the border from Canada into the United States. Petitioner was charged in federal court with knowingly transporting a noncitizen unlawfully present in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(ii). Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge and, on August 21, 2025, was sentenced to time served.

“The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) arrested Petitioner immediately following his sentencing and issued an arrest warrant. DHS also served Petitioner with a notice to appear charging him as inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) for being present without admission or parole and under 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(7)(A)(i) for lacking valid entry documents. Petitioner has been detained since his arrest at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. At Petitioner’s request, an immigration judge held a bond hearing on September 15, 2025. The government argued that Petitioner was statutorily ineligible for bond because, having entered the country without admission or parole, he is an ‘applicant for admission’ subject to mandatory detention during his removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2)(A). The immigration judge agreed and refused to release Petitioner.

“Petitioner’s primary argument in support of his habeas petition is that his detention during removal proceedings is governed by 8 U.S.C. §1226, not §1225(b)(2)(A). The government disagrees. The statutory authority for Petitioner’s detention matters because §1225(b)(2)(A) ‘mandate[s] detention … until [removal] proceedings have concluded’ in almost all cases while §1226 generally permits the government to release the noncitizen on bond or conditional parole. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 288, 297 (2018).

“This Court addressed the interplay of these two detention provisions in its recent decision in Guerrero Orellana v. Moniz. See __ F. Supp. 3d __, __ (D. Mass. 2025) [2025 WL 2809996, at *4- 9]. The Court concluded that §1226, not §1225(b)(2)(A), governs the detention pending removal proceedings of a noncitizen who entered the United States without admission or parole, was apprehended while residing in the country, and is not subject to the expedited removal process under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1). … For the reasons stated in Guerrero Orellana, the Court agrees with Petitioner that his detention is governed by §1226.

“This conclusion does not, however, fully resolve the question of whether Petitioner is eligible for release on bond or conditional parole. …

“The parties disagree as to whether Petitioner is subject to discretionary detention under §1226(a) or mandatory detention under §1226(c). The government contends that Petitioner’s criminal conviction under 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) constitutes an aggravated felony that triggers mandatory detention under §1226(c). Petitioner denies that his conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.

“The Court leaves the question of whether Petitioner’s criminal conviction triggers mandatory detention under §1226(c) to the immigration judge to address in the first instance. … No immigration judge has yet addressed whether Petitioner’s criminal conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony, so the Court declines to resolve the matter. …

“Accordingly, the Court allows the habeas petition (Dkt. 1) and orders the government to provide Petitioner with a hearing before an immigration judge to consider his request for release from detention under the framework of 8 U.S.C. §1226 within seven business days from the date of this order.”

The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.
The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law.
Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.
Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president.","Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges.

In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.

The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.

“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.

Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.

The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.

The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions.

Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019.

The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.

Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”

Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.

They include: John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Hollywood Burbank Airport, San Diego International Airport, San José Mineta International Airport, Sacramento International Airport, Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport and San Francisco International Airport.
Officials from Los Angeles International Airport did not respond to questions on whether the video was being played there.
Some airport officials have refused to play the video, calling it inappropriate.
At San Francisco International Airport, officials determined that the video wasn’t helpful.","Several airports in California have refused to play a video featuring U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for delays due to the federal government shutdown.

The video, playing for travelers waiting in Transportation Security Administration security lines at airports across the country, comes as the government entered a third week of a shutdown after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding legislation.

“It is TSA’s top priority to make sure you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” Noem says in the video. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government and because of this many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”

Officials at multiple airports in California say they are not playing the video at their locations. They include: John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Hollywood Burbank Airport, San Diego International Airport, San José Mineta International Airport, Sacramento International Airport, Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport and San Francisco International Airport.

Officials from Los Angeles International Airport did not respond to questions on whether the video was being played there.

Some airport officials have refused to play the video, calling it inappropriate. On Tuesday, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation called for Noem to be investigated for possibly breaking the Hatch Act by asking airports to play the video.

“Recent reports indicate DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air a video message featuring Secretary Noem, in her official capacity, making political attacks against Democratic Members of Congress,” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) wrote in a letter addressed to the Office of Special Counsel and reviewed by The Times. “This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act.”

The act, according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, is to “ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,” as well as protect federal employees from political coercion at work.

Noem’s video was received by airports on Thursday and was followed up by a verbal request from DHS officials to play it at security checkpoints, multiple airport officials told The Times.

The reasons the video is not being shown for California fliers varies.

In Orange County, airport spokesperson AnnaSophia Servin said that Homeland Security requested, to the airport’s director, that the video be played, but a final decision has not yet been made. In Burbank, political messaging is prohibited, officials said. In San José, an airport spokesperson said there have been no shutdown impacts and therefore no reason to play the video.

At San Francisco International Airport, officials determined that the video wasn’t helpful.

“SFO limits messaging at our security checkpoints to information intended to help passengers be prepared to go through the security screening process,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Any content, whether in video or print form, which does not meet this standard, will not be shown.”

When The Times asked Homeland Security officials to respond to airports not playing Noem’s video, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded with Noem’s video statement blaming Democrats.

But California airports aren’t the only locations choosing not to play Noem’s message.

Airports in Oregon, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle have also opted not to play it.

“We did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,” said Molly Prescott, a spokesperson for the Port of Portland, which manages Portland International Airport, said in a statement.

Oregon law also prohibits public employees from politicking on the job.

“We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law,” she said.

Officials in New York also pushed back against airing the video.

“It is inappropriate, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the values we expect from our nation’s top public officials,” New York’s Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said in a statement. “The [Public Service Announcement] politicizes the impacts of a federal government shutdown on TSA Operations, and the County finds the tone to be unnecessarily alarmist.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46126ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+257/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2F79%2F95c8e2ab486db96e3b3c75f00e0d%2F1525153-me-burbank-airport-ajs-20.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 08:56:35.905212

But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas.
And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.
Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.
“And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.","In Kentucky, patients drive up to two hours to see Dr. Manikya Kuriti, one of the few endocrinologists who serve the rural communities surrounding Louisville.

Kuriti’s husband, a pulmonologist, drives from Louisville to small hospitals an hour south and north, in Indiana, to help small teams treat critically ill patients.

Rural communities have long struggled to recruit and retain doctors. Many rural hospitals are struggling financially, and have had to eliminate services or even shut down. The shortage of providers is critical in rural communities that tend to have higher rates of chronic illness and early death compared with their urban counterparts.

Many immigrant physicians help fill those gaps thanks in part to the H-1B visa, which allows skilled foreign workers to come work in the U.S. Both Kuriti and her husband came to the U.S. via the H-1B visa.

But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. The announcement quickly drew criticism from leading medical organizations, which note immigrant physicians make up a significant portion of the health care workforce. They’re concerned the move will hinder the flow of immigrant doctors to the U.S. and exacerbate the nation’s doctor shortage, which is expected to worsen in the coming decades.

Earlier this month, labor unions and other groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the administration over the payment. They argue that the move is unlawful and that the president doesn’t have the authority to circumvent Congress to collect such revenue. The plaintiffs — represented by the South Asian American Justice Collaborative, the Justice Action Center and others — include the AFL-CIO Committee of Interns and Residents and Global Nurse Force.

Last month, the American Medical Association and more than 50 other organizations sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the administration to exempt international medical school graduates from the fee.

According to projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. could see a shortage of up to 86,000 doctors by the year 2036, the groups emphasized in the letter.

National interest

The president’s order says the secretary of homeland security can, at her discretion, waive the $100,000 requirement for prospective H-1B workers in specific industries if it’s in the “national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare” of the nation.

The AMA’s joint letter urges the secretary “to clarify that all physicians, including medical residents, fellows, researchers, and those working in nonclinical settings” are “critical to our national interest” and therefore exempt.

The Department of Homeland Security referred a Stateline request for comment to the White House, which hadn’t responded as of Thursday.

1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

Dr. Tom Price, who served as secretary of health and human services during Trump’s first term, said in an interview that medical workers should be exempt from the $100,000 fee.

“A significant fee for any further H-1B visas in the area of the health care workforce will be detrimental … especially in low-served areas or rural areas,” said Price, a former Republican member of Congress.

In 2024, nearly a quarter of licensed physicians in the U.S. were foreign-trained and roughly 46% of foreign-trained physicians practiced in rural areas, according to data from the Federation of State Medical Boards cited by the AMA. And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.

Trump and other critics of H-1B visas say that some employers, especially tech companies, have abused the program by using it to replace native-born workers with foreigners who will work for less, rather than using it to fill jobs they can’t find Americans to do. But tech companies would have an easier time paying the fee than many hospitals.

Elizabeth Ricci, a Tallahassee, Florida-based immigration lawyer and national expert in immigration law, said at least one hospital in the South has asked her whether it must pay the fee itself or whether it can pass it on to the prospective physician. Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.

“It’s probably going to require litigation to get that guidance,” Ricci said. “And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.

The University of Washington said it has paused H-1B visa petitions.

“The uncertainty around visas creates a significant disruption for talented individuals who hope to train and work at UW Medicine,” Dr. Tim Dellit, CEO of UW Medicine and dean of the UW School of Medicine, wrote in email to Stateline. “It represents a loss for the research and education communities, as well as for the vital clinical care we provide on behalf of our patients and the broader community.”

Iowa, West Virginia and North Dakota — conservative-leaning, largely rural states — had the largest share of physician applicants under the H-1B visa relative to total physicians, according to a study published in July in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

‘The need is there’

When Dr. Sridevi Alla arrived in Mississippi two decades ago, she was part of a small team of hospitalists at a rural clinic in Kosciusko, in the central part of the state. She now practices in Jackson, and on any given day, she could be treating patients having a stroke, complications from untreated diabetes, or someone with dangerously high blood pressure.

“In a state which already has a physician shortage, I think that’s definitely going to affect primary care,” Alla said, referring to the payment.

Alla said she considers herself a Mississippian, and that she’s always felt welcomed and valued by hospital leadership and patients.

“We never felt [like] foreigners in the medical community,” she said. “Maybe from an immigration standpoint we are, but not around being a part of health care.”

She noted Mississippi’s high rates of diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality and poverty.

“This is where I was trained. I sincerely feel like the need is there,” she said. “Even though maybe there are opportunities out [there], I never sincerely looked outside because I felt this is the home after home.”

Four-year limit proposal

Many physicians come to the U.S. under the temporary J-1 visa, which allows medical graduates to come for training and graduate medical education. They are then required to return to their home countries for at least two years. But they can apply for a waiver to stay if they work in rural or underserved communities, which allows them to transfer to an H-1B visa.

In addition to the new $100,000 fee, the administration has proposed a four-year limit on how long J-1 visa holders can stay in the U.S.

Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

AMA President Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, a Flint, Michigan, otolaryngologist, said both his parents immigrated to the U.S. from India to complete their medical residencies.

“In that same hospital where they did their training back in 1970, here in 2025, we still have 30 to 35 international medical graduates that come in,” he said.

Now, hospitals have to “figure out where we’re going to get $100,000 per doctor.”

“We need to not just have the physicians talking about this, but to add to that the understanding of our own lawmakers,” he said.

Dr. Mette Strand, an internal medicine physician at Livingston HealthCare, a 25-bed critical access hospital serving rural Montana, emigrated from Norway. Many of those who mentored her, including specialist colleagues, are immigrants, too.

“Cutting IMGs [international medical graduates], we would be in further need of doctors in an already underserved state,” she said. “I would have a hard time seeing how we would run our hospitals and our clinics.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/immigrant-doctors1760623121.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=K1O30MH0,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:24.978286

The Everett Police Chief and mayor say they did not notify the federal government and that ICE was waiting outside the police department.

Everett Police say they got a credible tip that a 13-year-old boy threatened another student.

Police arrested him last Thursday at a bus stop outside the Parlin School.

They found a six to seven-inch double-sided knife on him. He was taken to the police department, booked, and then, as he was outside the station, he was taken away by ICE agents while his mother was inside.

The mayor and police say they have no control over what ICE does, but people in the community are upset that a teen was quickly whisked away from his family.

“Even people who have committed crimes in this country have the right to due process under the Constitution, even the worse people who have done the worse things,” said Joanna Garren, an Everett School Committee member.

“It is the responsibility of our public servants to protect and serve all people in the community,” said an Everett teacher at a meeting. “All of us, especially those who are most vulnerable.”

On X, Homeland Security said the boy was in possession of a knife and firearm when taken in, with a rap sheet that includes violent assault with a dangerous weapon, battery, breaking and entering, and destruction of property.

However, the chief claims the teen did not have a firearm on him when he was arrested. What does happen when someone is arrested is that their fingerprints are taken and ICE has access to that database. ICE then determines if the individual is here illegally and sends over a detainer.

The teen is currently being held out of state.

The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday afternoon to approve a $3.57 million emergency allocation to dramatically scale up legal services, community outreach and rapid response networks for the county’s immigrant and refugee residents.

Sourced primarily from the Measure W Essential Services Fund, the allocation includes $2.5 million for immigrant and refugee support and an additional $1 million for a flexible contingency pool. The funds will extend and increase contracts for three frontline community coalitions.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.

Spearheaded by Supervisors Nikki Fortunato Bas and Elisa Márquez, the action is a direct response to what county staff reports describe as “exponentially more attacks” and “unprecedented levels” of federal immigration enforcement.

“This is about real-time response and building an infrastructure that will continue to educate and empower our communities to withstand this escalation of threats and attacks,” Márquez said.

Under the new federal budget, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is set to receive an additional $75 billion over four years, representing a more than 300% increase in enforcement and detention capacity.

Bas said that residents demanded greater support after a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows federal ICE agents to conduct stops based on perceived ethnicity, raising concerns about heightened racial profiling. The move also follows an incident last month where federal immigration officers detained a man inside an Oakland courthouse.

“With the surge in ICE arrests again, the targeting of our immigrant communities, the community has come to us to say it is urgent that we boost our capacity,” Bas said. “This will allow us to expand the rapid response hotline into the weekends and continue defending immigrants in our legal system to ensure they have due process.”

The six-month funding extension is designed to fortify the local safety net in a county where one in three residents is foreign-born and half of all children live in a mixed-status household, according to a letter from Bas and Márquez to the board recommending adoption.

Bay Area immigration arrests have doubled

Enforcement data for what ICE refers to as the San Francisco “Area of Responsibility,” which stretches from Kern County to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam and includes Alameda County, showed that immigration arrests doubled in early 2025.

This spike disproportionately impacts working-class families, particularly nationals from Mexico, Guatemala, India, El Salvador, and Honduras, according to the supervisors’ letter.

The rapid response hotline run by ACILEP, the Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership, documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025. At Tuesday’s meeting, ACILEP said during the weekday, one person currently staffs the phone at a time, highlighting the group’s limited capacity.

The $3.57 million will support the county’s three core partners in scaling their services:

ACILEP: The largest portion of the funding will support the expansion of the organization’s Rapid Response Hotline to operate on weekends and ensure 24/7 coverage, alongside bolstering legal services and community volunteer network coordination.

California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice: The funds will maintain removal defense capacity, offset filing fees for low-income clients and fund legal education and outreach — ensuring immigrants in removal proceedings have access to due process and legal protection.

Trabajadores Unidos Workers United: The group will use the funding to provide resources, mutual aid and community organizing opportunities to low-income immigrant workers and their families.

The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office. This funding will help offset skyrocketing immigration application and litigation fees for low-income clients, such as the recent significant increase in costs for asylum applications and green cards following the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budget bill.

Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco, and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated office of immigrant and refugee affairs.

“We definitely have to do more strategic planning and develop stronger infrastructure for the long term,” Márquez said.

Alameda County Together, an ad hoc committee prioritizing equity and inclusion for residents, recommended that the county establish such an office, which would be tasked with coordinating resources, overseeing immigrant-serving programs, and advising the board of supervisors on responsive policies.

County staff have been directed to return to the board on Oct. 21 with a comprehensive coordination plan, and again on Oct. 28. The county is engaging with philanthropists, including the San Francisco Foundation’s new initiative, the Stand Together Bay Area Fund, to support these initiatives.

“It’s really important that people have a sense of belonging in this county,” Márquez said. “By us investing in these services, to acknowledge the challenges that are occurring and finding a way to mitigate that, just reaffirms our commitment to being a space and inclusive community for everyone.”",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251015-195751.webp,N,,2025-10-16 08:56:48.675354

Immigration and Gangs in Tennessee ICE’s sweeping new national approach began in early February with a series of “enhanced immigration enforcement operations” in multiple cities across the country.
Between March and late May, when new orders led to a change in ICE tactics, ICE reported carrying out 22 special enforcement operations.
Local Democrats called the ICE operation “white supremacist terror.” Republicans, meanwhile, accused Mayor O’Connell of shielding gang members after he criticized ICE tactics.","On the night of May 4, the phones and social media of migrant rights activists in Nashville lit up with alerts, some with shaky cell phone videos all showing similar scenes: the multilane transport arteries that slice through south Nashville’s immigrant districts illuminated by the flashing red and blue of state trooper vehicles and the fuzzy yellow glow from the headlights of unmarked cars. Men in khaki shirts and wide-brimmed hats approached cars, while murky figures in tactical vests lurked over their shoulders in the distance.

The pattern soon became clear: Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) were pulling people over, then Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were detaining them. The 150 stops they made that night were part of a “public safety operation,” the THP said, targeting “areas with a history of serious traffic crashes and suspected gang activity.”

The sweep was part of a national effort to deliver on the campaign promise of President Donald Trump to launch “the largest deportation campaign in history.” That campaign, Trump claimed, would prioritize violent criminals and organized crime: drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and gangs with roots in Latin America.

The administration has called it the “worst first” strategy. And among their leading targets were the legendary Los Angeles-born Mara Salvatrucha, or MS13, and Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan prison gang that has spread throughout the Americas by preying on the exodus of people fleeing poverty, insecurity, and political oppression in Venezuela.

“All of these criminals, these murderers, these drug dealers — we’re getting them out. I will put these vicious, bloodthirsty criminals in jail, or I will get them out of the country,” Trump had said.

But if these operations were meant to dismantle criminal groups, there was little in the public record to show for it. During the Nashville sweeps, authorities detained just one alleged member of the MS13 and one from the Tren de Aragua. The operation also stirred up political controversy, sparked a community backlash, and has left many in the city’s migrant community living in constant fear.

The Tennessee operation was a microcosm of the conflicts caused by a national immigration crackdown that has been justified with the threat of Latin American organized crime. With two of the most prominent criminal groups in the Americas at the center of it, InSight Crime sought to determine the nature of these networks and the threat level they pose in Tennessee and measure it against the response by the government — as well as the impact of that response on local communities.

This is the first of three articles resulting from that effort. It chronicles the crackdown and the reverberations from it. The other articles profile the Tennessee operations of the criminal groups in question: the MS13 and Tren de Aragua, two of the most violent gangs in the Americas. The reports are based on dozens of interviews with law enforcement and judicial officials, community workers and activists, family members of the detained, immigration lawyers, political leaders, and experts on all sides of the debate. We also read through dozens of court filings and public statements by officials across the country and analyzed crime and immigration data stretching back decades.

The effects of these crackdowns are still being felt. While the government claims it has deported record numbers of gang members, and supporters of these policies say these operations are a critical tool for combating transnational criminal networks, authorities refuse to share the crucial details needed to corroborate these efforts.

Instead, the information released suggests the scope of the operations has widened considerably beyond the “worst first” mission, undermining trust between some of the communities most affected by organized crime and the law enforcement agencies tasked with stopping it. But more than that, the operations are the most visible manifestation of tectonic shifts in the US government’s approach not only to immigration but also to combatting organized crime that could have a lasting impact on US security policy.

Immigration and Gangs in Tennessee

ICE’s sweeping new national approach began in early February with a series of “enhanced immigration enforcement operations” in multiple cities across the country. The statement announcing the raids included few details, but a series of photos showed arrests of alleged MS13 and Tren de Aragua members in Maryland and South Carolina.

Within a month, ICE was carrying out similar operations around the country. Most took place over several days and were carried out alongside other federal agencies or state and local law enforcement. They arrested tens, even hundreds, of people at a time. The operations hit Texas, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, Alabama, New York, Florida, and Maryland before reaching Tennessee.

Tennessee was a logical target. Located in the southeastern United States, the state typifies many of the organized crime and migration dynamics that have risen to the top of the Trump administration’s security agenda. Foreign-born residents account for around 6% of the state’s total population and 15% in Nashville, according to 2024 census figures. While accurate figures on the number of undocumented migrants are difficult to calculate, the American Immigration Council estimates a total population of around 156,000 living in the state, where they work in sectors such as construction and hospitality in urban hubs and in the agricultural sector that forms the backbone of the state’s rural economy.

But Tennessee also has gang problems and high murder rates in its major cities, human trafficking, and high levels of fentanyl addiction. And gangs such as the MS13 and Tren de Aragua are present in migrant communities, where they commit serious crimes, mostly against members of those same communities.

Of the two, the MS13 has a much deeper history. The gang has been in Nashville for more than two decades, and the city has seen two major criminal conspiracy investigations leading to multiple convictions on charges ranging from murder to kidnapping.

Tren de Aragua’s presence, however, is harder to pin down. State law enforcement first warned of the advances of Tren de Aragua across Tennessee in late 2024. While they have since faced criticisms for overplaying the threat posed, in 2025, federal prosecutors brought sex trafficking charges against what they allege is the first organized Tren de Aragua cell in the state.

Casting a Wide Net

From the beginning of the Nashville operation, it was clear that ICE and state police were casting a wide net. Legal observers described to InSight Crime how THP troopers pulled drivers over citing minor traffic violations. The THP would approach the cars first, then ICE officers would demand to see proof of immigration status. If any of those in the vehicles couldn’t provide it, ICE bundled them into their vehicles and whisked them away.

The ICE officers sometimes demanded to see people’s tattoos, but activists who spoke to InSight Crime said they did not see any authorities doing criminal background checks on the scene, and little more was done to establish any criminal affiliations or record. Beyond concentrating operations along the main roads of the town’s immigrant neighborhoods, there was scant evidence to suggest the stops were targeting specific individuals, they said.

“I don’t think they had any rhyme or reason. It was just whoever they decided that looked Latino at that instance and could be pulled over,” Jazmin Ramírez, a migrant rights activist and community organizer who witnessed two arrests while carrying out legal observer work, told InSight Crime.

SEE ALSO: What Trump’s Hardline Immigration Policy Means for Crime on the US-Mexico Border

Both state and federal authorities have refused to release all but a snapshot of data on the background of those stopped, which was obtained by local journalists. That snapshot provided details on the ethnicity of 34 of the drivers who were stopped: 29 of them were Latino, two Asian, two Black, and one white.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who heads ICE’s parent agency, pushed back on allegations of racial profiling in the operation.

“Do you have any indication that anybody was targeted just specifically because of what their race or creed was?” she responded when questioned by journalists in Nashville. “Every single enforcement operation that we have conducted has been based on case work and investigative reports of criminal activity.”

Activists, though, said anyone caught in the dragnet risked arrest. On one occasion, legal observers documented ICE pulling a mother from her children. On another, they detained a man in front of school children waiting for a bus.

During the operation, much of Nashville’s migrant community essentially went into lockdown, only leaving their homes when they had little other choice.

“It was this weird, eerie silence. People not on the streets, businesses completely empty — this hyper alertness of ‘could that be the car?’” said Ramírez.

Despite the claims the operation was targeting gangs, there were few signs of the authorities trying to gather intelligence or build cases after making arrests. Instead, they denied many detainees the due process and rights they would have been entitled to in the US criminal justice system, including access to a lawyer or the right to a phone call.

Many of those detained were shunted around jails in Tennessee before being transported to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, 500 miles away. Some spent time chained and shackled and did not get adequate food and medical care, according to multiple accounts by detainees, relatives, and activists.

“They were treated like they weren’t human,” said Chelsea White, whose Mexican husband, Hilario Martinez Garcia, was detained during the operation by THP working with ICE on the outskirts of Nashville.

While some of those detained were able to contact their families, many others were not. The first time some families heard from their loved ones was when they received phone calls from Guatemala, El Salvador, or Mexico.

White heard nothing about her husband for a week.

“I had no idea where he was, what was going on, what was happening, if he was okay,” she said.

Since the operation, there is no sign authorities have brought criminal charges against those arrested in the operation. Instead, in many cases, immigration officials pushed detainees to sign self-deportation papers, which many did not understand as they were only offered in English, activists and relatives told InSight Crime.

White’s husband eventually signed those papers after a court hearing in which a judge told him he would be held in ICE detention indefinitely if he decided to fight his legal case.

“There were people that had been there for months already and didn’t even have a court date, and he was scared that was going to be his fate,” she said.

White, a US citizen who has lived her whole life in Tennessee, moved to Mexico with her three children to keep her family together. As she tries to rebuild her life, she bristles at the suggestion that the operation that tore it apart was taking aim at organized crime. When Trump said his government would target gang members and violent criminals, she had believed it, she said during a telephone interview from Mexico.

“But he’s not just getting those people. He’s getting normal, everyday people that go to work and come back. He’s getting family people.”

Hundreds of ‘Aliens,’ but Few Gang Members

The Nashville operation lasted a week, after which ICE reported that agents had arrested 196 “criminal illegal aliens.” Of these, 95 — fewer than half — had prior criminal convictions or pending cases.

While ICE has refused to release any information on the case history of the 95 with criminal records, it did provide some details on seven “notable arrests.” Their rap sheets included rape, domestic abuse, sex with a minor, aggravated assault, drug possession, and intent to supply. Headlining the list were two alleged gang members.

One of them was Franklin Velásquez, an alleged MS13 member from El Salvador. Velásquez had been convicted in the US for drug possession, failure to appear at judicial proceedings, and criminal impersonation, and he is wanted in El Salvador on aggravated murder charges. However, no information was provided on what role, if any, Velásquez had with the MS13 in Nashville, and his name had not come up during an MS13 case that concluded in July 2024 with the conviction of 18 gang members.

The other detainee with alleged links to organized crime, according to the statement, was an unnamed 37-year-old Venezuelan who ICE claimed was a Tren de Aragua “affiliate member.” A later statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) providing further information on the “notable arrests” made no mention of the alleged Tren de Aragua member.

Federal authorities stonewalled efforts to provide more. ICE declined to provide details on the alleged Tren de Aragua member or any further information on the other detainees to the media, and it did not respond to InSight Crime’s request to discuss the operation. DHS sent InSight Crime a link to its press release.

When the legal department of Nashville’s mayor’s office asked DHS and THP for the details of those detained, THP responded that no such documents existed, while DHS did not respond at all. The THP also refused to release all but heavily redacted dispatch records on the traffic stops made from the first night, making it impossible to verify where, when, why, or how Velasquez and the alleged Tren de Aragua member were detained.

The results of ICE’s special enforcement operation in Nashville reflected the patterns seen on the national stage. Between March and late May, when new orders led to a change in ICE tactics, ICE reported carrying out 22 special enforcement operations. Of those, gangs and transnational criminal networks were explicitly named as priority targets in more than half of the cases. But of the total of 6,022 people detained in these operations, only 27 were alleged to be gang members or have gang ties – less than 0.5%. And only 8 of those were actually named.

ICE’s public statements may only offer the highlights of the overall panorama, and those arrested during the operations were not the only alleged gang members detained over the period. But the complete datasets available paint a similar picture.

According to an analysis by the Cato Institute that combined publicly available government data with internal ICE data, ICE detained 204,297 people between October 2024 and June 2025. Of those, 65.4% had neither convictions nor pending criminal charges. While the data did not include information on the number with alleged organized crime ties, records showed 6.9% were detained for violent crimes and another 4.5% for “vice” crimes — drugs, gambling, and the sex trade — sometimes linked to gang activity.

Among Law Enforcement, A Mixed Reaction

Backlash to the Nashville ICE operation was immediate. Activists organized patrols of legal observers, blockaded ICE facilities where detainees were being held, and organized solidarity campaigns. The city’s liberal mayor, Freddie O’Connell, also spoke out.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said.

But the reaction among law enforcement and judicial officials to the sweep was mixed. Thomas Jaworski, a former federal prosecutor who in 2024 rose to the position of acting US Attorney for Middle Tennessee, told InSight Crime that while the numbers of serious criminals detained may be low, those individuals are likely major drivers of crime locally.

And while the operation in Nashville may not have directly weakened gangs or other transnational criminal networks, it may reduce their operational capacity, he added. The street presence of ICE and the threat of deportation, he said, will likely force these groups to keep a low profile.

“You’re going to see a slight dip going forward simply because of the immigration enforcement activities. That is not to be ugly about it. That’s just a fact of life,” he said.

Scott Mechkowski, a former ICE Deputy Director for New York City, told InSight Crime such broad operations can be an effective tactic for dismantling gangs by picking up what often gets left behind by slow-moving, costly investigations.

“Some of it may have shifted into wrapping it up in your daily local enforcement,” he told InSight Crime. “Why build the case if we know these guys are gangbangers and they’re illegal. Just lock them up and get rid of them.”

The operations, Mechkowski added, are likely not as indiscriminate as they can appear from the outside.

“It’s using intelligence and data collection to help you focus on your mission, your priorities,” he said. “You’re not racially profiling, but you are profiling.”

“You become experts on what to look for or what’s out of the norm,” he added.

Mechkowski sees the approach as a corrective to years of policies under the previous US administration of President Joe Biden that shackled law enforcement.

Under Biden, he said, ICE was restricted by protections for migrants lost in the never-ending asylum backlog or with protected immigration status, who could not be removed and had to be cut loose after arrest. He also highlighted the difficulties working in “sanctuary cities,” like New York and Los Angeles, where municipal authorities protect migrant communities by placing limits on the cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.

“Under the Biden administration, it was hard to lock anybody up,” he said.

In May, Mechkowski testified at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the protection of ICE officers during such operations. Also speaking that day was another former official that saw the issue very differently.

In his testimony, former ICE Chief of Staff Jason Houser labeled the operations as “designed for media optics rather than public safety.”

“When resources are diverted toward the arrest of low-priority individuals, enforcement becomes a dragnet,” he told the committee. “That may generate high arrest numbers for press releases, but it pulls ICE personnel away from complex, high-risk cases that improve public safety. It creates a false sense of security while leaving human trafficking, narcotics operations, and violent criminal networks less disrupted.”

Houser did not respond to InSight Crime’s request for an interview. Other former officials, though, similarly questioned both the tactics and the results.

A former senior DHS official who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity expressed doubt that authorities are tracking down people whom they know have direct contacts with MS13 or Tren de Aragua in operations such as the one in Nashville.

“All the highway patrol operations and random traffic stops, that’s just to increase fear, it’s a fishing expedition,” he said.

Rather than a concerted crackdown on organized crime, the former official said, the results in Nashville and beyond point to agencies scrambling to deliver the numbers the Trump administration needs to keep its ambitious deportation promises. That pressure could also explain the lack of transparency over the allegations of gang affiliations.

“There are incentives to characterize somebody falsely or to err on the side of assuming that there’s activity with TdA or trying to conflate TdA or MS13 activity with stuff that’s pretty benign or routine,” he added.

A Law Enforcement Overhaul

While special enforcement operations such as the ICE sweep in Nashville have been the most eye-catching aspect of the convergence of crime and immigration under Trump, they are just one part of much deeper changes that could radically alter how transnational organized crime is investigated and prosecuted in the United States.

In March, the government announced its new “Take Back America” initiative. At the top of their new list of priorities was immigration — or, as the Department of Justice (DOJ) memo announcing the change put it, to “repel the foreign invasion.” To facilitate quick removals, the memo directs prosecutors to prioritize charging “the most serious, readily provable offense” over building cases.

The new priorities were then reinforced in funding plans. In 2026, the DHS will see a 65% increase in its budget. This will be the start of an unprecedented surge in funding planned for the next few years, much of it funneled to ICE, where billions of additional dollars will be allocated to recruiting new enforcement officers, building and operating detention facilities, and removals. With a projected budget of nearly $28 billion a year over the next four years, the changes will make ICE by far the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States.

At the same time, the DOJ faces billions of dollars in budget cuts. And the federal agencies traditionally tasked with investigating organized crime — the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) — have already seen their budgets slashed by hundreds of millions of dollars and their agents pulled from their duties to support ICE immigration enforcements.

As if to put an exclamation point on the new strategy, one of the main tools used by the DOJ to bring local and federal law enforcement together to target criminal networks — Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) — is being dissolved altogether.

The changing panorama has caused alarm among some of those who have been leading efforts to take on transnational organized crime in Tennessee, where recent cases brought against MS13 and Tren de Aragua have been built on slow-moving, complex investigations carried out by multiple agencies, including through the organized crime task forces that are now being disbanded.

One recently retired Tennessee organized crime prosecutor, who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity, doubts the effectiveness of prioritizing immigration enforcement and worries it could undermine efforts to investigate criminal networks.

“It’s having the reverse effect of what the administration claims that it should have and what most people think that it should have when you end up just arresting people based on their immigration status,” the former prosecutor said.

Not only are such operations unlikely to reach top-level criminals, they may also undermine the community relations that are key to prosecuting such actors.

“I’m sure that it has put a damper on people willing to serve as informants, because if you have some kind of status that might subject you to enforcement, you’re certainly not going to willingly go talk to anybody and provide information,” the former prosecutor added.

In some cases, such tactics could even strengthen the hold of criminal groups over their victims. The former prosecutor pointed to a recent sex trafficking case authorities connected to Tren de Aragua, where the alleged traffickers used their victims’ immigration status as leverage.

“It makes that even easier, [they can say] ‘you see these arrests out here? That’s what will happen to you unless you continue to do this,” the former prosecutor said.

The pulling of resources away from investigative agencies and to immigration enforcement will also undermine capacity to build cases, the ex-prosecutor added.

“The time and resources that [agents] have to put into these immigration arrests makes them completely unable to perform any of their long-term investigations, so you just completely hamstring them.”

However, ex-ICE officer Mechkowski believes this prioritization of immigration enforcement does not have to come at the expense of building cases against transnational gangs and criminal networks.

“I think they can exist side by side,” he said. “I don’t think they’ve abandoned dismantling gangs, just that maybe right now the focus has changed a little bit. And I still think they’re doing those investigations.”

The deployment of investigative agents to immigration enforcement operations, he added, is likely a temporary measure that will no longer be necessary with the surge in ICE funding and recruitment.

Security Policy and Politics: Worlds Apart

While security and justice officials and experts debate the effectiveness of immigration enforcement as a tool to combat organized crime, on the political stage, the two political parties occupy different realities. And again, Tennessee has seen its local version of the conflict playing out nationally.

Local Democrats called the ICE operation “white supremacist terror.” Republicans, meanwhile, accused Mayor O’Connell of shielding gang members after he criticized ICE tactics. In September, one local representative upped the stakes further by calling for the National Guard to be deployed to Nashville because the mayor was “using the city as an outpost for international gangs to set up shop in our neighborhoods.”

Nationally though, the Trump administration has moved away from the threat of organized crime in its orders to ICE. Several US media outlets reported on a meeting in late May in which Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who is leading the administration’s immigration crackdown, tore into ICE leaders from around the country for not making enough arrests.

“What do you mean you are going after criminals?” Miller angrily told them, according to an account of the meeting in the Washington Examiner. “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?’”

Within days, that is exactly where ICE went, as well as to construction sites, farms, and other workplaces that rely on migrant labor. The number of migrants with no criminal record being detained soared. And whatever remained of a “worst first” policy targeting gangs and organized crime fell away.

“At this point, I can’t see any strategy other than harassment, discrimination, and racism,” the former DHS official said.

While ICE reports since the Miller meeting reflect a pivot to worksite enforcement, special operations have continued, with four carried out between June and September that declared gangs and transnational criminal networks as their targets or that they were based on a “worst first” approach. In those operations, ICE reported making 1,172 arrests. Just 14 of them were suspected members of organized crime groups.",https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gangs-and-Immigration-Cover-chapter-1-InSight-Crime-Sep-2025-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 07:56:46.387281

It’s the first time the financial agreement has been made public after the White House initially said the deal amounted to $6 million.

The payments were part of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown and decision to invoke a wartime law to remove Venezuelan nationals.

The four-page agreement between the United States and El Salvador verifies that the funds came out of the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law, which gives financial assistance to security forces and is subject to a human rights law known as the Leahy Law.

That human rights law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons — facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.

“The purpose of this grant is to provide funds to be used by the Salvadoran law enforcement and corrections agencies for its law enforcement needs, which includes costs associated with detaining the 238 TdA members recently deported to El Salvador,” according to the agreement.

Those who drafted the law raised concerns that those payments violated human rights laws, as more than 250 Venezuelan men were removed from the U.S. to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, despite a federal judge’s order barring such action.

Congressional Democrats have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the White House for a copy of the financial agreement for months, over concerns the funds were being used in violation of human rights.

March flight to El Salvador

On March 15, the Trump administration sent 238 men to CECOT, after invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to apply to Venezuelan nationals 14 and older who are suspected members of the gang Tren de Aragua.

The agreement, dated March 22, noted the men could be detained up to a year.

It also bars any of the $4.76 million to be used to help asylum seekers seek legal counsel for the U.S. asylum process, for access to abortion, funds for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency that provides humanitarian assistance to Palestinians or for programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

The men were released back to Venezuela as part of a prison swap in July, but they remained at CECOT for four months. Some of those detained, including Kilmar Abrego Garica, of Maryland, whose mistaken deportation captured national attention, detailed psychological and physical torture.

No protection from torture

The document was obtained through a lawsuit by Democracy Forward, which specifically argued the financial agreement between El Salvador and the U.S. “was created without any legal basis.”

“The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

That case is being overseen by District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg, who also ordered the Trump administration to turn around planes carrying men removed under the wartime law.

Here's where they're happening,Melissa Montalvo,,,,,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article312445163.html,"ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have risen by 58% in the first seven months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period last year.
ICE arrested an estimated 1,156 individuals in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare counties between January to the end of July.
The San Francisco ICE field office, which oversees operations in the Central Valley, made 305 arrests under a “fugitive operations” program.
However, ICE arrests have been confirmed at courthouses, ICE-check-ins and federal immigration service offices in the region, according to Fresno Bee reports.
Tulare (seven arrests), Fresno (six) and Kings (six) counties made up the bulk of ICE arrests at county jails.","ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have risen by 58% in the first seven months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period last year.

The Fresno Bee analyzed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Deportation Data Project, a UC Berkeley Law School initiative.

The data sheds light for the first time on how ICE operates in the Central Valley, such as where administrative arrests have taken place and which demographic groups have been most impacted.

ICE arrested an estimated 1,156 individuals in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare counties between January to the end of July.

During the same time period in 2024, ICE made 733 arrests in the six-county region.

While many of these cases are pending, at least 516 individuals have already been deported. Most of these arrests took place in the Fresno and Bakersfield areas, where ICE has sub-field offices.

Bill Ong Hing, founding director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at University of San Francisco, warned that arrests will likely increase throughout the state after last month’s Supreme Court decision that allows immigration agents to conduct “roving patrols.” He said the court’s decision gives ICE the permission to “racially profile.”

“They’re trying every strategy,” he said.

An ICE spokesperson said the agency could not verify or comment on the data compiled by the Deportation Data Project.

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is executing its mission of identifying and removing criminal aliens and others who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” an ICE spokesperson said. “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.”

This tally is likely an undercount of total ICE apprehensions of Valley residents.

The data only reflects administrative arrests made by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, the division responsible for enforcing immigration law in the country’s interior. Also, not all arrest records in the dataset include details on where an individual was arrested. The San Francisco ICE field office, which oversees operations in the Central Valley, made 305 arrests under a “fugitive operations” program. Exact location details are unavailable for these arrests.

The data also does not include criminal arrests conducted by ICE or arrests made by other federal law enforcement agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

How many people have been deported from Fresno area?

Roughly half, or 516, of the 1,156 people arrested by ICE in the region have already been deported, data shows.

Most, or 333, of these deportations were from arrests made in Fresno County, followed by Kern County, with 185. (Deportations or removals are classified as: “Deported/Removed - Deportability” or “Excluded/Removed - Inadmissibility” in the chart below.)

Hing said people who have been arrested are probably taken to an ICE detention facility.

“If they sign away their rights, then they’ll be deported, probably within a week or so,” he said.

About 112 of those arrested, have “self-deported,” or returned voluntarily. (These cases are categorized as: “Withdrawal Permitted - I-275 Issued,” “Voluntary Departure Confirmed,” or “VR Witnessed.”)

As of late July, 369 cases remain active, meaning their immigration and removal cases are pending.

Where are people being arrested by ICE in Fresno area?

Most ICE arrests this year have taken place in the Bakersfield and Fresno areas, though the exact locations are unknown and are categorized as “general, non-specific” areas.

However, ICE arrests have been confirmed at courthouses, ICE-check-ins and federal immigration service offices in the region, according to Fresno Bee reports.

Approximately 21% of these arrests took place in the region’s federal and state prisons as well as county jails.

The top three state prisons for ICE arrests in the six-county region include Avenal, Corcoran and Pleasant Valley. Federal prison arrests took place at FCI Mendota and FCI Atwater, and there was one arrest recorded at the Golden State Annex ICE detention facility.

Tulare (seven arrests), Fresno (six) and Kings (six) counties made up the bulk of ICE arrests at county jails.

ICE arrests of Central Valley residents could take place outside the region, such as if they have hearings at immigration courthouses in San Francisco, Concord or Sacramento.

Hing said he’s aware of at least two Central Valley residents who have been arrested from the immigration courthouse in San Francisco through his involvement with the city’s rapid response network.

About half of all arrests were classified as “located” or “non-custodial arrests” — which the Deportation Data Project said likely indicates arrests made in the community.

Nearly half, or 43%, of total administrative arrests, were part of ICE’s “Criminal Alien Program,” or CAP. This program focuses on the “identification, arrest, and removal of Incarcerated aliens at federal, state, and local levels, as well as at-large criminal aliens,” according to ICE.

Only two individuals have been arrested as part of a workplace enforcement operation — which took place in Kern County in June.

Who is being arrested by ICE in the Central Valley?

Sixty-five percent of those arrested by ICE in the six-county region had previously been convicted of a crime — or 787 out of 1,156. Meanwhile, 112 people arrested by ICE, or 12%, had pending criminal charges.

The remaining 265 individuals arrested, or 23%, only had an immigration violation.

However, nationwide, most people held in ICE detention have no criminal history, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a Syracuse University research project.

A majority, or 61%, of those arrested were from Mexico (713), followed by India (115) and El Salvador (63).

Questioning from board members prompted Comeaux to reveal the funding he allegedly declined.

""We were contacted by the federal government either last week or within the last two weeks, and we were offered $25 million to be part of 287-G, and we said, ‘Absolutely not. No.’ That was me who said that, turned it down,"" Comeaux said.

For now, DPD only assists ICE with requests for securing a perimeter or transport. But Comeaux is worried continued exposure on what he considers a non-issue will turn it into one.

""There's nothing happening in Dallas, but every time we do something like this, we're bringing more attention to Dallas. We don't need that attention. We don't want to deal with that smoke,"" Comeaux said.

ICE 287-G program

Funding from ICE's 287-G program allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Several North Texas law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE, including the Keller Police Department and several local sheriff's offices.

The federal government hopes others will join. A TV ad currently runs targeting Dallas and Fort Worth law enforcement.

The ad began airing just over a month after ICE held a two-day hiring event in North Texas, which was met with some community backlash.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/screenshot-2025-10-15-163146.png?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-16 03:01:47.011362

We, as workers, have a common enemy that is raising prices and keeping our wages down consciously—and it’s not your immigrant neighbor.
This isn’t just about immigrant workers coming to places like the United States, or the UK, or Western Europe.","Rumeysa Ozturk’s seizure by plainclothes masked agents outside of her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, in March 2025 had all the hallmarks of a kidnapping. The PhD student, originally from Turkey, was flown to a detention facility in Louisiana, stripped of her F1 student visa, and slated for deportation—all as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration targeting international students for pro-Palestine speech. The draconian arrest sparked outrage among elected officials, advocacy groups, and more. It signaled a frightening escalation—and served as a signal that more was to come.

After two months, however, and due to relentless mobilizing work conducted by a coalition of pro-Palestine activists, free speech advocates, labor organizers, and more, Ozturk was released on bail. She remains free today.

“If you want to know what [rapid response] looks like, it’s getting a call at 10 pm that your member was kidnapped off the street, there’s video of it that’s going to hit the new—and springing into action,” says Dave Foley, president of SEIU Local 509. Foley, whose local represents nearly 30,000 workers in human services and education across Massachusetts, was on the front lines in fighting for Ozturk’s release.

Ozturk’s arrest came as just one of many escalations in the Trump administration’s crusade against immigrants in the United States—including the illegal military occupation of Democratic-controlled cities, the repurposing of prison camps, and the use of detention to third-party nations. However, the expansion of ICE, immigrant detention, and rollbacks to civil liberties that’ve been at the center of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration are not entirely new. They build atop histories of anti-immigrant sentiment and policies—some more recent than others.

“It’s built on other layers of foundation,” says Dr. A. Naomi Paik, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “But the escalation and the rapidity—how quickly this is happening—that feels new.”

Dr. Paik’s research centers immigration and detention within the United States. She is the author of Rightlessness: Testimony and Redress in U.S. Prison Camps Since World War II and Bans, Walls, Raids, Sanctuary: Understanding U.S. Immigration for the Twenty-First Century.

In this August interview, Foley and Paik sat down for a conversation on the evolving threat that escalating immigrant detention poses to our communities—as well as new and historic lessons for our solidarity movements.

This interview has been condensed and edited lightly for clarity.

—Henry Hicks IV

Henry Hicks IV: Dr. Paik, how is what we’re seeing today unprecedented—and in what ways have we been here before?

Dr. A. Naomi Paik: One is the technological advances that have really escalated and accelerated the surveillance of not just migrants but of all of us; and the profiteering from these new surveillance technologies. This has been going on for quite some time, but Big Data and the advancement of AI has accelerated things so much, in such a way that it’s actually hard to keep up with what’s even happening.

In terms of detention, the extraordinary rendition of migrants from United States territory to extraterritorial sites of detention—like CECOT in El Salvador, or Uganda, or even Guantánamo—is new. Having said that, extraterritorial detention itself is not new. During the 1990s, the United States detained Haitian and Cuban migrants at Guantánamo during refugee crises. So, that set the precedent, not only for migrant detention in extraterritorial spaces, but also the indefinite detention of men captured under the War on Terror.

Under Trump, the US is taking migrants from the United States territory. That’s the new thing. [They are taking migrants] to this site now that is now synonymous with torture, whereas before, we would intercept migrants in international waters and then bring them to Guantánamo to prevent them from getting to the United States territory, where they have things like claims to asylum. Again, it’s an advancement. It’s an escalation of ideas that were already there.

HH: Dave, from your perspective as someone who’s doing work on the ground, how is what you’re seeing new?

Dave Foley: [SEIU has] always had connections with the different ICE Watch networks. Where we’re seeing things differently today is statuses being revoked. We had a member of ours on an F-1 student visa. Her F-1 student visa was terminated in a very high-profile, public way—and that’s new to us. It really scared a lot of people. The administration will constantly announce new things that leaves us scrambling.

HH: How are unions and different community groups well-positioned to be doing this kind of resistance work?

DF: Unions are fundamentally built on one-on-one relationships in a workplace. You can move people politically. You can give people a real political education that you can’t do through TV, or ads, or newspapers, or anything like that, in the actual worksite, because you have organic leaders there. So, you might have someone that you know that is a real xenophobe or a real racist, and you figure that they can’t be moved on something like immigration justice, but if anybody can do it, it’s the union steward who sits with them through a disciplinary hearing and saves their job. Or it’s the on-the-ground worksite leader who rallies the rest of the workplace to get a better raise or better rates on the health insurance premiums in a contract. These people can see real leaders, who can then give them a political education.

The other important thing that unions provide is two-way communication, in an organized way. We hear from our members. For instance, when our member was kidnapped off the streets by ICE, we knew about it before anybody did, really, because our steward network was plugged into it and knew to call the union very early, so we could spring into action and provide as much assistance as possible. We’ve got organized lists and can communicate with our members, so we can mobilize and turn people out to a rally or in the streets very, very rapidly—like within 24 hours.

And then, finally, a union like ours, with the size and resources that we have, we’re in a powerful position to actually talk to elected leaders and push them into positions that might make them feel uncomfortable. [We can] leverage the political power that we get from our rank-and-file members and turn our voting power into real political action.

HH: Dr Paik, how have you seen effective resistance movements manifest in prior moments that echo what we’re seeing today?

ANP: A lot of the resistance that we’re seeing—on the streets of DC, in Chicago, with community defense, people coming out on the streets to prevent ICE from taking somebody, or to chase ICE away, or recording them in the Home Depot parking lot—that didn’t come out of nowhere. It [builds] on previous eras and again. It’s not just from Trump 1.0. It’s also from Obama. The formation of those community defense groups, of rapid response networks, of these different kinds of communication—using social media, using email—that has already been built. When Trump got reelected, it could be activated once again.

And there’s muscle memory there—not only in organizing leadership but also just regular people. I am not one of the main organizers of any of the rapid response networks in Chicago, but when the call is made, I am going to show up for the trainings. The fact that they can make the call, that they know where to make it, and that people actually show up, that is, again, that kind of community muscle memory that’s being activated in this moment. People have learned over time what kinds of tactics and what kind of strategies are going to be effective.

In the Obama era, we saw more of this kind of “good immigrant, bad immigrant,” “were they here legally,” “did they commit a crime before,” etc. We should defend immigrants because they’re “good,” and they go to church, and they work hard, and whatever. In this moment, it makes zero sense to make those kinds of arguments—because anybody who is without status or is not a citizen is at risk.

HH: We’re talking about the role that unions are playing in defending immigrants—when citizen workers and immigrants are often positioned against each other. Why is rejecting that narrative of incompatibility so important?

DF: I think it’s something that has to be confronted and rejected very consciously at every opportunity. We have a whole lot more in common with our immigrant neighbors, brothers, sisters, and siblings than we do with those that try to divide us. We, as workers, have a common enemy that is raising prices and keeping our wages down consciously—and it’s not your immigrant neighbor. It is the billionaire who owns your company and probably owns the property that you rent from.

ANP: The kind of “citizen-worker versus immigrant-worker” is a total distraction, and it keeps us fighting each other so that we are not directing our ire where it should be: to the actual culprits who are making our lives worse.

The whole point of having borders is to keep wages low and to keep labor extraction for profit high. This isn’t just about immigrant workers coming to places like the United States, or the UK, or Western Europe. It’s also about our corporations going into poorer places, colonized places, and extracting low wage labor there as well. We have to think about how labor is working globally to extract wealth from the bottom and concentrate it at the top. One of the functions of borders is to divide the global working class.

HH: You described earlier that the practice of detention itself is something that’s happening across borders as well.

ANP: It’s becoming a global industry. Again, there are all these innovative ways of extracting profit from regular people—that don’t necessarily require labor. Our data is one source of profit extraction, and then also social control through things like detention, like policing, like surveillance networks. Those are other ways of extracting profit that don’t require us to work at subminimum wages. This is part of the technology thing that really worries me. They don’t even need to extract our labor. Then what?

DF: If I could add to that: Dr. Paik is saying that there’s no labor cost to this data collection—but that does not mean it’s free. We just saw in the Big Beautiful Bill a massive cut in what will be care work, what will be labor. The cuts that we’re going to see to Medicaid are going to translate into cuts to jobs in the fastest-growing industry in the United States right now, which is care work. And at the same time, we’re going to see a massive amount of money move right into ICE, into the building of new detention centers. Those facilities will be funded by cuts that will cost jobs. That’s the cost.

HH: There’s so much more time to go in this adminitration. How are y’all approaching the long-term nature of this fight? How are y’all thinking about how to withstand the continual escalation of these things over the next three years, at least?

DF: In the labor world, we use two different terms: “mobilizing” and “organizing.” Mobilizing is essentially turning people out, and organizing is really building that infrastructure so that when you need to, you can turn the maximum amount of people out or take the biggest action that you can. We’ve had to mobilize a lot lately, in these past seven months. But the real priority for us, is continual organizing.

No matter who the next president is and which party they come from, we know that we need to push beyond just defending against what Trump has done, and we need to really push for immigration reform—which has never happened in my lifetime. We have so many people in this country that have been waiting and waiting and waiting for justice to happen. We need to use a moment like this to really organize and to build, so that we can get beyond where we have been for my entire life. But you’re right, this is not a sprint. It’s a marathon. There’s a long way to go.

ANP: It’s so hard because the crises that we’re facing are so immense, and they have been building for so long. The roots of the crises that we’re facing go so deep. And so, to really extirpate those roots, it’s going to take so much effort. And it’s going to take everyone’s effort.

DF: It might feel like the forces arrayed against us are limitless, but you can outwork them. They’re not as resilient as us. They don’t work as hard. They’re not used to working as hard. I’ve seen it in so many fights—we can easily be outspent, but we can outwork them time and time and time again.

Ad Policy

HH: Are there prior resistance movements or flash points of community strength that give you hope?

ANP: Going further back, [I think of] the abolitionist movement against slavery. They weren’t just demanding freedom for the enslaved. They wanted to overturn an entire global political economy based on enslaved labor. That’s huge! They were really trying to change the whole world. And they did it. That is remarkable to me. People who were not even considered people overturned an entire global political economic system based on their nonrecognition as humans.

For more recent moments, I think of the summer of 2020. The lesson for me from that summer is that we don’t know how historical change is going to happen, and that it doesn’t necessarily happen in a linear fashion. I did not expect abolitionist thought to become a mainstream news item at all—ever. But it did. We also have to understand that even when movements don’t get the goods in the way that we would have liked to have seen, that they still make meaningful changes that we then build upon.

A lot of people criticize Occupy Wall Street because they weren’t organized enough, they didn’t move things in a certain direction, it didn’t have a durable life—but it gave us the language of “the 1%.” For me as a teacher, before Occupy Wall Street, if I said “the 1%,” no one would know what I’m talking about. I say it now and everyone knows exactly what I’m talking about. All of these movements build on each other and learn from each other.

DF: [I think of several], from the Haitian Revolution to the changes we’re seeing in public opinion when it comes to Israel and Gaza and the genocide. I get a lot of inspiration from historical reminders that popular opinion and people can be moved and they can be changed. Something that seems ubiquitous can change really, really quickly by the actions of very, very brave people.

We are seeing a level of disgust in what the Trump administration is doing, that is drawing people to action. This could be an inflection point. We don’t know where this is going to go, but it’s inspiring to know that this history isn’t written—and that we can shape it.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226092155.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:56:58.310616

A Chicago judge signed an order Wednesday prohibiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from making arrests at Cook County courthouses, citing concerns about ""fear or obstruction"" while suspected illegal immigrants attend court proceedings.

Local officials in the Midwest sanctuary city, which the Trump administration has targeted in its federal immigration crackdown, claimed people were avoiding court because they were afraid of being detained.

The order bans immigration authorities from making civil arrests of any ""party, witness, or potential witness"" during court appearances.

JUDGE ALLOWS ICE TO CONTINUE COURTHOUSE ARRESTS IN NEW YORK CITY FOLLOWING LEGAL CHALLENGE

Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans reportedly said justice ""depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction"" in his decision.

The Trump administration in June launched an initiative to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings.

The tactic stirred controversy, with critics claiming migrants seeking legal citizenship would be less likely to show up to hearings, and those arrested after hearings may not have additional criminal histories.

FEDERAL JUDGE LIMITS ICE ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT, PROBABLE CAUSE

Videos of the arrests went viral on social media, with some accusing ICE of ""kidnapping"" migrants.

In September, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit in New York City regarding the practice, though a federal judge ultimately ruled there was not enough evidence to suggest ICE's courthouse arrest policy changes were ""unexplained, arbitrary and capricious"" after 2021 guidance allowed arrests at or near immigration courts.

""Every day, our members are forced to choose between being kidnapped and/or put into expedited removal or risking deeper legal consequences because they're too scared to go to court,"" Diana Konaté, deputy executive director of Policy and Advocacy at African Communities Together, wrote in a statement published by the ACLU related to the New York City case.

""This is exactly what the administration intended—for people to be so fearful of enforcement that they forfeit the very resources and systems in place to protect them,"" Konaté added.

DESTINY TORRES, BYLINE: The county typically uses state of emergency funding to help with natural disasters like flooding, earthquakes and fires. But county officials are hoping to help stabilize neighborhoods that have been hurt by ICE enforcement. LA County has nearly 950,000 immigrants without legal status, or 9% of the region's population. The Trump administration has been cracking down on undocumented immigrants in cities across the country and is conducting deportations. According to county officials, the raids have caused fear, disruption to local businesses and lost wages for immigrant workers who are afraid to go out in public. The declaration itself doesn't say how the funding would be used, but supervisor Lindsey Horvath says it will allow the county to respond quickly to the growing crisis.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LINDSEY HORVATH: It means Los Angeles County can move faster, coordinate better and use every tool available to support and stabilize our communities.

TORRES: The declaration allows the county to seek financial aid from the state. Supervisor Kathryn Barger was the one dissenting vote on Tuesday. She said in a statement that a local state of emergency is not the way to address the fear among immigrant communities. She calls it a symbolic gesture that could open up the county to litigation, which the county can't afford. Supervisor Janice Hahn says the move is not symbolic but critical to the county's response moving forward to better support its residents.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JANICE HAHN: We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers were taken from their workplaces, and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on the table.

(Fox News) NEW YORK STATE OF MIND — New York lawmakers are planning a review of rising home insurance costs.","With help from Caroline McCarthy

POLITICO’s exclusive reporting on a Young Republican group chat filled with racist epithets and hateful jokes reverberated Tuesday across the country, resulting in mounting condemnation and more chat members out of their jobs.

Peter Giunta lost his post as state Assemblymember Mike Reilly’s chief of staff, Playbook reported.

Joe Maligno was out as an employee of the New York State Unified Court System.

Vermont’s Republican governor and GOP lawmakers called on state Sen. Sam Douglass to resign.

The Kansas Republican Party announced that the Kansas Young Republicans, where William Hendrix was a leader, were inactive.

That’s on top of what happened before the story published: Hendrix lost his job with Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, and Bobby Walker’s offer to join NY-19 congressional candidate Peter Oberacker’s campaign was effectively revoked.

In the chat — 2,900 pages of which were leaked and reviewed by POLITICO — Giunta joked: “Everyone that votes no is going to the gas chamber.”

Maligno responded, “Can we fix the showers? Gas chambers don’t fit the Hitler aesthetic.”

The remarks — a look into how a group of Young Republicans talk in private and the coarsening rhetoric in the Trump era — drew swift rebukes from Republicans and Democrats.

But not from Vice President JD Vance. He broke with Republicans who broadly condemned the comments within the chat.

On X Tuesday night, Vance drew attention to Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general Jay Jones, who texted a colleague about shooting the then-Republican House speaker and wishing harm on his children.

“This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia,” Vance wrote with a screenshot of the text exchange. “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”

Maligno, Hendrix and Douglass did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In separate statements, both Giunta and Walker apologized for the messages they wrote in the Telegram chat but questioned whether they had been altered or taken out of context. They also attempted to blame the release of their chat on the New York Young Republican Club, a political group that operates at the city level and which is often at odds with the state group.

“I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language found within the more than 28,000 messages of a private group chat that I created during my campaign to lead the Young Republicans,” Giunta said. “These logs were sourced by way of extortion and provided to POLITICO by the very same people conspiring against me in what appears to be a highly-coordinated year-long character assassination led by Gavin Wax and the New York City Young Republican Club.”

Walker struck a similar tone.

“There is no excuse for the language and tone in messages attributed to me. The language is wrong and hurtful, and I sincerely apologize,” he said. “It’s troubling that private exchanges were obtained and released in a way clearly intended to inflict harm, and the circumstances raise real questions about accuracy and motive but none of that excuses the language. This has been a painful lesson about judgment and trust.”

Wax declined POLITICO’s request for comment.

GOP Rep. Mike Lawler condemned their chat remarks, as his Democratic rivals circulated photos of him with Giunta and Walker.

“The deeply offensive and hateful comments reportedly made in a private chat among members of the New York State Young Republicans are disgusting,” Lawler said via his spokesperson Ciro Riccardi.

Several racial minorities were slurred in the private Telegram group chat, and congressional Democrats aren’t standing for it.

“When we say white supremacy is thriving on the right, they call us reactionary,” Rep. Yvette Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said on X. “Give me a break. The future of the Republican Party proudly embraces bigotry that belongs in the past, and every American needs to recognize how dangerous that is.”

ABOVE THE FOLD

TRUMP TO CITY: DROP DEAD: President Donald Trump once again threatened to cut off New York from federal funds if the “communist” Mamdani wins the mayoral race.

“If somebody wins and has no chance of ever having a great economy because of that philosophy, you would put a halt to what we’re doing,” Trump said at a lunch Tuesday with Argentine President Javier Milei.

Trump slammed Mamdani several times over the course of the nearly hour-long press availability, insisting incorrectly that the democratic socialist Mamdani is a communist.

“I’m not going to send a lot of money to New York. I don’t have to. You know, the money comes all through the White House,” he said. “And if they’re going to be sending us stupid policies, I mean, communist policies… we’re not going to ruin one of our great cities.”

Trump also took a shot at Mamdani’s opponents, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, saying “it’s a fluke if (Mamdani) gets in” because “there are a lot of failed people that he’s running against.”

Asked about Trump’s comments, Mamdani brushed it off as nothing new — Trump is already hurting New York by trying to pull infrastructure funding in retaliation for the government shutdown.

But if Trump tries while Mamdani is mayor, he said he’d go to the courts.

“We will continue to receive funding from the federal government, and that’s not because of President Trump’s generosity. That’s because it is the law,” he said. “And just because he utters something does not make it the law.”

Hochul, meanwhile, suggested she’d appeal to Trump’s own interests if he tried.

“There’s no person who’s ever sat in the Oval Office who understands more than Donald Trump that New York City is the economic engine for the entire state,” she said. “This is detrimental to his properties, business interests, his friends in the city, and a whole way of life that perhaps he may need to come back to.“ — Jeff Coltin

CITY HALL: THE LATEST

QUEENS BOY, NOT A QUEENS COLLEGE BOY: Cuomo’s past attempts to cut state aid to the City University of New York are raising questions about his commitment to public universities in a race centered on affordability.

CUNY endured decades of declining state aid, including during the former governor’s tenure from 2011 until 2021 — a trend the state has started to reverse.

POLITICO spoke to 16 people, including city and state lawmakers, former state and CUNY officials, and students and advocates, who portrayed a record of neglect toward public higher education — a history they argued bodes poorly for the university if he becomes mayor.

Read more from POLITICO’s Madina Touré on how Cuomo treated CUNY “as the foster child he never really wanted.”

CRYPTOKEEPER: Nearly four years after converting his first paycheck to cryptocurrency, Mayor Eric Adams created the new New York City Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain on Tuesday.

A City Hall spokesperson said the announcement had nothing to do with cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce’s massive, $1.1 million donation to a pro-Adams super PAC and his gushing compliments about the mayor, and that the insinuation they’re connected “doesn’t make sense.” In fact, the spox said, City Hall’s been planning to launch it for months.

Alex Sommer, who advises crypto clients at Tusk Strategies, welcomed the news.

“Plenty of cities are clamoring to be home to this booming industry so it makes sense for the city to stake its claim,” he said. “It’ll obviously be up to the next mayor to see this through, but elevating New York with all the attention in D.C. should be helpful.” — Jeff Coltin

NEW FROM PLANET ALBANY

DEREGULATION TIME: Hochul’s plan to review unnecessary or outdated state regulations is potentially music to the ears of her allies at The New York Business Council.

The lobby group last month issued a report that decried the regulatory environment in New York that it argued is choking private sector investment.

“We have work to do,” Business Council President Heather Mulligan said. “But this report shows that we are all willing to work together with state leaders to address these challenges and make necessary changes to enhance our business climate, quality of life, and ultimately, strengthen our economic competitiveness to improve economic opportunities for all New Yorkers.”

Last week, Hochul’s top budget adviser requested state agency and department chiefs draft up lists of regulations for potential elimination. Some of these regulations are more than a century old and concern outdated modes of transportation like steamboats.

The regulatory push is a layup for the Democratic governor, who is running for reelection next year and has tried to show voters she’s focused on issues like affordability. It will be very easy for her campaign a year from now to boast about eliminating bothersome rules and regulations — stealing a Republican-sounding talking point along the way. — Nick Reisman

A FRIEND OF THE SENATE: Christopher Friend was appointed the top budget aide to state Senate Democrats. He replaces David Friedfel, who announced plans to depart the job earlier this year.

Friend has worked for the Senate Democrats for the last six years. He’s taking over the role ahead of a potentially tough state budget season as New York officials absorb federal aid cuts and prepare to run for reelection. — Nick Reisman

KEEPING UP WITH THE DELEGATION

RYAN’S FUNDRAISING: Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan today will report raising more than $1 million across a trio of campaign committees, according to details exclusively shared with Playbook.

The swing seat Hudson Valley lawmaker’s haul includes his main campaign committee and a pair of PACs, including the group he formed this year to aid down-ballot Democrats with public service backgrounds.

Ryan’s principal campaign committee will report raising more than $800,000 in the most recent fundraising period. His cash-on-hand total stands at more than $2.2 million.

The healthy fundraising clip stands to help Ryan as he prepares to run for a third term and potentially scare off rivals in the sprawling House district. — Nick Reisman

In compliance with the law, Ruano said she applied for a T Visa, which protects survivors of crimes related to human trafficking, in February while working in Wisconsin, and her attorney requested a stay.
ICE denied the stay in March and informed her attorney that if she did not “promptly” return to El Salvador, she would be detained at a forthcoming June check-in with ICE, according to the lawsuit.
“At the first check-in, the agents told me I would be deported,” Ruano said, according to a news release from the plaintiffs in the suit.
Those protection were designed to offer a pathway to permanent status, according to legal organizations focusing on immigration.","A coalition of legal organizations and undocumented immigrants has filed suit in Los Angeles challenging an ICE policy that authorizes the “routine” jailing and deportation of noncitizen survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, according to court papers obtained Wednesday.

The suit filed Tuesday by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law and others contends the policy “violates the very legal protections, crafted by Congress and passed with bipartisan support, that were designed to shield vulnerable adults and children from harm.”

The plaintiffs also allege in Los Angeles federal court that ICE “routinely imprisons and deports immigrant survivors who have been formally granted the right to remain in the U.S.” and “regularly deports survivors of trafficking and other serious crimes without carrying out the required legal review to determine if they are eligible for protections that Congress specifically created to keep survivors safe from deportation.”

A message requesting comment sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not immediately answered Wednesday.

According to the lawsuit, the government’s practices are harming “vulnerable survivors,” including Yessenia Ruano, who says she came to the United States from El Salvador seeking safety from human trafficking in 2011 and worked as a teacher’s aid in Milwaukee until June 2025, when she says she was forced by ICE to self-deport.

In compliance with the law, Ruano said she applied for a T Visa, which protects survivors of crimes related to human trafficking, in February while working in Wisconsin, and her attorney requested a stay. ICE denied the stay in March and informed her attorney that if she did not “promptly” return to El Salvador, she would be detained at a forthcoming June check-in with ICE, according to the lawsuit.

Ruano returned to her home country with her U.S. citizen children.

“At the first check-in, the agents told me I would be deported,” Ruano said, according to a news release from the plaintiffs in the suit. “They said that if I didn’t go on my own, they would hunt me down and find me, and that I would be separated from my daughters, detained and deported. I was in turmoil, because I also could not face being taken away from my kids and imprisoned.”

To address the fear that frequently prevents immigrant survivors from seeking help due to the threat of deportation, Congress created the U and T visa programs in 2000 through its renewal of the Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act.

Those protection were designed to offer a pathway to permanent status, according to legal organizations focusing on immigration. The lawsuit’s plaintiffs allege the administration of President Donald Trump “is actively denying and unlawfully dismantling these vital protections, all in the service of illegal enforcement actions that ignore the law.”",https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LPT-L-DOWNTOWN-PROTEST-0612-KB19.jpg?w=1024&h=475,N,,2025-10-15 23:57:13.130939

Cook County includes Chicago, which has seen a federal immigration crackdown in recent months.

Detaining residents outside courthouses has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The US Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a Wednesday statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July, when representatives said they’ve seen US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed on to a petition earlier this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a Wednesday statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

“Our courthouses remain places where all people — regardless of their background or circumstance — should be able to safely and confidently participate in the judicial process,” Evans said in a statement.

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations, and has drawn lawsuits from some statesand the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Questioned about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol statewide. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done,” Welch said. “These should be safe spaces.”

Republicans questioned their opponents’ sincerity. Debating a resolution condemning political violence, GOP Rep. Adam Niemerg noted incendiary language from Gov. JB Pritzker — in the spring he called for “street fighters” to oppose the administration — although the governor has not espoused violence. Rep. Nicole La Ha, who said she has received death threats, accused Democrats of trying to stifle opposition.

“This is not a stand against violence,” La Ha said. “It is a tasteless tactic to punish dissent and difference of opinion.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use on protesters

Meanwhile, Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed chase on a residential street on Chicago’s South Side.

A few protesters also gathered Wednesday afternoon outside an ICE facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, where a fence that has been at the center of a recent lawsuit had come down.

A judge ordered ICE to remove the fence after the village of Broadview sued federal authorities for “illegally” erecting an 8-foot-tall fence outside the facility, blocking public streets and creating problems for local emergency services trying to access the area. On Monday, state legislators and Black mayors of nearby suburbs gathered outside the facility to demand the fence be removed and announce an executive order limiting protests in the area to designated zones. Trump has long targeted Black mayors in large Democratic cities, many of whom have voiced solidarity with one another in recent months amid federal interventions in their areas.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents in their areas.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events across the city and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three children detained earlier this month.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25288654664026.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-15 19:02:18.839079

The conservative justices, who make up most of the bench, appear sympathetic to the case that Louisiana’s congressional map – which added a second majority-Black district after a Voting Rights Act lawsuit – violates the constitution.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative, pressed Janai Nelson, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was defending the map, as to why section 2 was still needed.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases, but they should not be indefinite and should have an endpoint. What exactly do you think that endpoint should be?” he said.

The chief justice, John Roberts, a conservative but swing vote on the court, pressed Nelson on what the proper role of race in redistricting was.

“What’s the proper size?” he said. “Is it wiggle room we’re talking about or a significant percentage?”

Neil Gorsuch, another conservative justice, appeared skeptical of the use of race in redistricting.

“One argument is often, ‘Well, once you found a section 2 violation, you’ve got a compelling interest to go ahead and discriminate on the basis of race in your remedial map,’” he said.

2. Getting rid of section 2 would be ‘catastrophic’ for Black voters, lawyers said

Nelson was asked by Justice Elena Kagan what the consequences would be if the court got rid of section 2.

“I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson said. She went on to say that many of the Black representatives in Louisiana alone were elected from districts that exist because of the Voting Rights Act. “Any further neutering of section 2 would resurrect the 15th amendment as a mere parchment promise.”

J Benjamin Aguiñaga, the solicitor general of Louisiana, pushed back, saying: “I think there’s been a lot of sky-is-falling rhetoric from the other side in this case. I don’t know what our legislature would do if the court rules in our favor … I don’t think the sky is going to fall.” He said that Republicans would not necessarily wipe out both the majority-Black districts in Louisiana, which elected Democrats last year, because doing so could make Republican districts more competitive.

3. There was a lot of wrangling over a similar case from 2023

There was a lot of back and forth on Wednesday over Allen v Milligan, a 2023 supreme court case in which the justices said section 2 of the Voting Rights Act required Alabama to add a second majority-Black district.

Nelson told the justices that Milligan was “a nearly identical case”. At another point during the arguments, Justice Kagan pointed out that many of the arguments Louisiana and white voters challenging the map were making were ones the court had already rejected in Milligan.

The message to the rest of the justices was clear – it was an effort to remind them that siding with Louisiana in this case would essentially amount to overturning precedent set just two years ago.

“This court said that it must be particularly concerned about changing its decisions or rejecting stare decisis in cases that involve a sensitive political context like this one, that calls the court’s legitimacy into question in a unique way. My opponents here have not done the labor of showing that precedent should be overturned,” Nelson said.

Recognizing that challenge, Roberts said Milligan “took the existing precedent as a given and considered Alabama’s application of its approach to the evidence”. It was a subtle but potentially significant remark that signaled he might be open to reconsidering the precedent in Milligan.

4. Louisiana argued that race-based redistricting is unconstitutional

Aguiñaga said in his opening argument: “Race-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our constitution.” He added that racial stereotypes were a consequence of the practice.

“They assume, for example, that a Black voter, simply because he is Black, must think like other Black voters, share the same interests and prefer the same political candidates, and this stereotyping system has no logical endpoint.”

Edward Greim, a lawyer for white voters who challenged Louisiana’s map, told the justices: “In today’s America, voters like the appellees are still being racially stereotyped to place them into single-member districts. If it was ever acceptable under our color-blind constitution to do this, it was never intended to continue indefinitely.”

5. Justice Kavanaugh appeared interested in a proposal that would make it harder to challenge districts

Throughout the arguments, Kavanaugh repeatedly asked lawyers to address a proposal from the justice department that would reconfigure the test plaintiffs need to go through to win a section 2 lawsuit.

Part of that test requires plaintiffs to show they can draw a reasonably configured alternative district that gives the minority group a chance to elect their preferred candidate. The solicitor general’s proposal would add an additional layer to that test. It would require the challengers to show an illustrative district that also meets the political goals of mapmakers.

Such a requirement would be essentially impossible to meet, especially in the US south, where voting is often highly racially polarized, Nicholas Stephanopolous, an election law expert and professor at Harvard, wrote in a blogpost earlier this month.

“Suppose the [solicitor general]’s position were adopted and Louisiana (the home of Callais) decided to get rid of both of its congressional minority-opportunity districts in order to craft an all-Republican map. Any section 2 plaintiff would then have to prove that a reasonably configured, majority-minority district could be drawn while preserving the plan’s all-Republican delegation,” he wrote. “In all likelihood, this showing couldn’t be made because, under conditions of severely racially polarized voting, any majority-minority district would almost certainly elect a Democrat, not a Republican.”

6. Progressive voting groups said the court’s decision could cost Democrats a significant number of House seats

The supreme court is considering the case as Republicans make a nationwide push to redraw district lines to shore up their advantage in the US House ahead of the 2026 midterms. The aggressive effort is unusual and has been criticized as an anti-democratic effort to prevent GOP politicians from being held accountable to voters.

A decision striking down section 2 ahead of the midterms, depending on timing, could significantly help Republicans. It could cost Democrats about 12 seats in the House, according to a New York Times analysis. A report by two progressive voting rights groups put the number of seats at risk even higher, at 19.

“It’s enough to cement one-party control of the US House for at least a generation,” said the groups, Fair Fight Action and Black Voters Matter.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d910783b55e45eebc59aa01e96c88b8de4a903ab/271_0_4272_3420/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce1de38af6a110926e98a2933e75196c",N,,2025-10-15 19:57:33.589724

The news outlet reported that neighbors have resorted to forming human chains to help Catholic migrants fearful of ICE go to and leave Sunday Mass so they could worship and receive the sacraments.

In February, more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups filed a lawsuit in federal court to challenge a Trump administration policy that rescinded long-standing restrictions on ICE agents from making arrests at what are seen as sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals.

The lawsuit, in which Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection represented the plaintiffs, argued the new policy sparked fear of ICE raids both in their own congregations and in the populations they serve, lowering attendance at worship services and curtailing their ability to serve the less fortunate.

In April, a judge declined to grant a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs, but the lawsuit is ongoing.

In September, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops submitted an amicus brief, sometimes called a friend-of-the-court brief, to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to support the plaintiffs' argument that the changes to the policy have put their congregations in an ""untenable position.""

""They either increase the risk to their congregants of harmful enforcement action by maintaining the obligation to attend weekly services, or limit the provision of in-person religious services to their congregants in response to the imminent threat of an enforcement action, and their congregants' well-founded fears thereof,"" it said.

Asked for comment, a spokesperson directed OSV News to the text of the amicus brief.

ICE has argued that the policy changes will help them deter criminal activity. In a previous statement about the lawsuit over those changes to OSV News, Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary for public affairs, said, ""We are protecting our schools, places of worship, and Americans who attend by preventing criminal aliens and gang members from exploiting these locations and taking safe haven there because these criminals knew law enforcement couldn't go inside under the previous Administration.""

""DHS's directive gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs,"" McLaughlin.

But faith groups are not the only ones who have expressed concern about the rollback. An Oct. 14 report from Axios said health care workers have raised alarm about the same policy rollback, and that ""stepped-up enforcement is interfering with care in some instances."" LAist reported federal immigration agents have interfered in care or efforts to provide medical privacy to detainees.

The sensitive locations policy is among the religious liberty concerns some Catholic immigration advocates have expressed about recent immigration enforcement policy actions.

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation's duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

As a group, Catholics in the U.S. are deeply connected to immigrant populations and are the single largest group of Christians directly affected by the U.S. mass deportation campaign.

A joint report by the National Association of Evangelicals, the USCCB's Migration and Refugee Services, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and World Relief, found more than 10 million Christians living in the U.S. would be vulnerable to deportation under Trump administration policies implemented in 2025.

Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of deportation. The Christians most at risk of deportation are Catholics, 61% of the total.

Another 7 million Christians who are U.S. citizens live in the same household as someone at risk of deportation.

According to Pew Research Center data released in June, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%). Pew also found that eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics were either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of immigrants (22%).

The Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, issued a reminder to the faithful in May that they are not required to attend Sunday Mass if they fear for their well-being, according to the church's own teaching and canon law.

Police in some Texas cities get a heads up before ICE raids and arrests. Austin is not one of them.

In an interview with The Texas Newsroom, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said they are not warned ahead of time when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to conduct sweeps in city limits. Davis said this lack of communication causes confusion and threatens to create dangerous misunderstandings between local and federal law enforcement agencies.

People who witness ICE arrests have even reported them as assaults or kidnappings, she added, prompting local police to investigate what happened. Davis said APD often only finds out about raids at all because of the public attention they draw.

The Travis County Sheriff’s Office said it also doesn’t hear about impending immigration raids.

“We are not notified, but that's not unusual,” Kristen Dark, senior public information officer for the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview. “State and federal agencies have no obligation to notify us when they're conducting operations in our jurisdiction.”

There have been several raids in the Austin area this year, including one in East Austin near a construction site that resulted in multiple arrests. Federal and state officers were involved in that raid.

Aggressive public sweeps like this have become a hallmark of the second Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. In some places, local law enforcement has provided support to federal agents to carry out raids. In others, ICE has accused city police of refusing to help.

Notification has been inconsistent nationwide. In June, Los Angeles police said they were not informed ahead of raids in that city. That same month, city and county law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska, said they were notified, with deputies backing up operations with traffic enforcement.

The Texas Newsroom reached out to police departments and county sheriffs’ offices across the state to learn more about their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Their answers revealed that ICE also provides advance notice to some local agencies in the state, while keeping silent with others.

In the Houston area, the sheriff is ""frequently"" given advanced notice of large-scale immigration operations “for situation awareness,” Communications Advisor Jason Spencer said in an email. “The Harris County Sheriff’s Office is in frequent communication with our counterparts at all local, state, and federal agencies, including DPS and ICE.”

The Houston Police Department was less open in explaining its relationship with federal immigration officials.

“We do not comment about other agencies' policies,” Spokesperson Shay Awosiyan said. He declined to answer follow-up questions.

El Paso Police Spokesperson Adrian Cisneros said they have “a working partnership” with law enforcement agencies at multiple levels, including ICE, but declined to elaborate. He too said “we're not speaking on behalf of other agencies.""

Police and sheriffs’ offices in Bexar and Dallas did not respond to questions.

Some departments coordinate with ICE, which can facilitate communication. Sheriff’s officers in Hays County, for example, actively partnered on a raid earlier this year that led to the arrest of dozens of men and women.

The Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office also partners more closely with federal law enforcement than many of its peers. It is the only one of the five most populous Texas counties to pen a formal agreement, through what’s called the 287(g) program, with ICE to enhance collaboration with state and local law enforcement partners. A sheriff’s office spokesperson said all questions about this coordination should be directed to ICE.

The federal agency did not respond to questions about why some law enforcement agencies were notified about immigration actions and others are not.

The lack of notification may be due in part to a lack of cooperation. Many big city police departments in Texas and elsewhere have preferred to keep the agency at arm’s length.

In Austin, the police chief said officers are required by state law to notify ICE if a background check indicates that a suspect may be in the county without legal status. But she added officers do not typically ask a suspect's immigration status.

“Our priorities are violent crime here in this city, crime prevention,” Davis said. “It’s not about immigration.”

She said while advance notification of big ICE operations would be useful, she does not want Austin police to work more closely with the agency.

“The Hispanic population is one that does not trust law enforcement to begin with,” Davis said.

U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith in September ruled that the Department of Homeland Security directive making enforcement of Trump’s immigration agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief grants was unconstitutional and harmful to states and their residents.

Yet Smith found the department has continued to attach the condition to FEMA grants as part of a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make” or else risk losing funding already appropriated by Congress.

“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids,” Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in a ruling Tuesday.

R.I. federal judge strikes down Trump edict tying federal disaster aid to immigration

A filing by a coalition of 20 Democratic attorneys general that sued the department over the grant conditions in May accused the Trump administration of violating Smith’s order. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading the case, Illinois v. Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The Oct. 8 motion asking Smith to enforce the order noted that states and municipalities in late September received award letters in which FEMA “copy-pasted the contested conditions” with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.

“Plaintiff States are, as a result, still required to certify, as a condition of obtaining federal funds,” they wrote.

AGs attached letters received by emergency management agencies in California, Colorado and Illinois. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency has not received any letters with the immigration language as of Wednesday, spokesperson Courtney Marciano said in an interview.

Smith ordered the Department of Homeland Security to permanently stop enforcing immigration conditions against plaintiff states and that the agency must amend grant awards within seven days to remove language related to complying with federal immigration law.

A Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for inquiry on whether officials intend to comply with the new court order.

The Trump administration argued in an Oct. 10 court filing that it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and was only seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions should the ruling be overturned.

“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. “The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”

But Smith in his ruling Tuesday said that no matter how confident the Trump administration may be of their chances of appeal, the contested conditions at the moment are unlawful.

“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote.

Neronha commended Smith’s latest ruling against what he called “blatant overreach” by the Trump administration in ignoring the September court order.

“Whether it’s a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or some other enforcement, the courts are holding up,” he said in a statement. “And we will continue fighting for the American people for as long as this administration puts them in harm’s way.”

Besides Rhode Island and Illinois, other states that were part of the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.

It was unclear whether the removal was temporary or permanent.

The removal complies with an order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt of the Northern District of Illinois, who set a temporary restraining order after finding that ICE had erected the fence on municipal property without getting necessary permissions, exceeding its authority.

“The law, including municipal law, applies even to the federal government,” said Village of Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson in a statement.

“This is a victory for the rule of law in a country that is still a democracy,” Thompson said in the statement.

“And it is a victory for Broadview residents and businesses who depend on their municipal government to assure public safety.”

Hunt ruled that ICE violated local safety codes by restricting first responders’ access and that the fence caused irreparable harm to public safety. The gate, which is 16 feet wide, is smaller than the 20-foot requirement set by the International Fire Code adopted by the village.

“DHS’s Beach Street gate creates a quasi-federal zone where the Village’s ability to respond to emergencies is hindered and only allows it to provide lifesaving services at the whims and fancies of the Federal Defendants,” the ruling stated.

For more information, please visit www.democracyforward.org About the American Immigration Council","Washington, D.C, October 15 — Today, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, the American Immigration Council, and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, demanding the release of critical records the government has unlawfully withheld about arrests at immigration courts and the dismissal of immigration cases.

Read the lawsuit filing here.

Since May 20, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) and Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), have been taking part in a coordinated effort to detain noncitizens appearing for hearings in immigration courts nationwide.

Arresting people who voluntarily show up for their immigration court dates in search of protection is a deeply problematic practice. Immigration courts are not criminal courts and are supposed to be places that guarantee fair hearings, not act as pipelines into detention. When those who show up seeking a fair day in court are instead arrested, it undermines core tenets of our democracy, discourages people from pursuing their legal rights, and inflicts serious human costs.

Additionally, ICE attorneys have been asking immigration judges to dismiss cases and shift people into expedited removal, a fast-track process with fewer due process protections and no path to permanent residence. The EOIR, the agency which runs the immigration courts, has directed immigration judges to grant these dismissals on the spot, even though this violates agency policy and long-standing practice.

Seeking to better understand how and why arrests at immigration courts are taking place, LatinoJustice and the American Immigration Council filed a total of 11 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, six with the EOIR and five with ICE on July 28 and 29, 2025. The requests seek basic information about arrests and dismissals around immigration courts, and communications between and within the agencies coordinating these activities. LatinoJustice and the Council also asked for these requests to be handled quickly through expedited processing.

Yet to date, the government has failed to provide timely and adequate responses to ten of these FOIA requests, in violation of the law. The EOIR has declared that it cannot find any guidance it issued to immigration judges about dismissing cases and courthouse arrests, even though a copy of applicable guidance has been leaked to the public. The EOIR has also refused to even search for records about the extent of its coordination with ICE, while ICE has ignored or delayed the processing of all the requests to it.

“Our FOIA requests seek to shine a light on how ICE operates in immigration courts, where families are fighting to keep their families together and for their future,” said Rex Chen, supervising counsel for Immigrant Rights at LatinoJustice PRLDEF. “Instead of transparency, they have chosen secrecy, stonewalling or have provided inadequate responses to our request. It is unacceptable to prolong this urgent matter.”

“Families’ futures are on the line. That’s why we need to better understand how these arrests at immigration courts are being carried out, and the degree to which supposedly independent and neutral agencies like the EOIR are pushing a mass deportation agenda. The public has a right to know what the EOIR and ICE are doing behind closed doors,” said Chris Opila, staff attorney for transparency at the American Immigration Council.

Read the lawsuit filing here.

“The public has a right to know when our government rewrites the rules to make mass arrests and deny people of due process — especially inside the very courtrooms meant to deliver justice,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is separately litigating to challenge these arrests. “The administration cannot hide guidance that turns immigration courts into traps and accelerates deportations without fair hearings. We will not allow these agencies to operate in the shadows. Transparency is the first safeguard against abuse of power, and we’re in court to demand accountability.”

The lawsuit seeks to compel the four agencies to comply fully with FOIA and turn over all the documents responsive to 7 of the requests. It also demands the expedited disclosure of guidance directives and correspondence between ICE and the EOIR.

Rosa DeLauro sent out an email press release about the Hamden ICE raid.","Hamden’s mayor, town council president, and two dozen immigrant rights activists and fellow politicians gathered on Dixwell Avenue Wednesday afternoon to denounce an ICE raid that took place at a nearby car wash Wednesday morning.

Still looking for answers as to what exactly happened, the elected officials said that federal agents seized a total of eight people.

An eyewitness to the raid, meanwhile, said she saw at least 10 agents show up — some wearing masks and tactical gear — and described a man being slammed to the ground and a woman being hauled away into an unmarked van.

Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett said at Wednesday’s press conference at the Keefe Community Center that the raid happened at the Optimo Car Wash, located at 1126 Dixwell Ave., at approximately 10:20 a.m.

She said that, as part of this raid, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained a mother and father while their kids were in school.

“The acts from the administration and ICE are deplorable, they are disgusting, they are not what we represent in Hamden,” Garrett said. “People are living in fear because of an inhumane presidency.”

Wednesday afternoon’s presser was also attended by Hamden Legislative Council President Dominique Baez and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker, among a host of state legislators, pastors, and immigrant rights advocates.

One of the speakers at the presser identified herself only by her first name, Rachel, and said she was at the car wash Wednesday morning when the raid took place.

She said that, while she was at the car wash, she heard “tires screeching to a halt.” When she ran to the window to see what was happening, she said she saw at least 10 ICE agents, many of whom were wearing masks and tactical gear. She heard the girl who works at the front desk scream.

She said she saw a “man who was slammed to the ground.”

When she asked the man if he was OK, Rachel said, an ICE agent “got in my face and said I would end up just like him” if she interfered. She said she saw an ICE agent haul the girl who screamed into an unmarked van.

An employee at NE Motors, which sits right next door to the car wash, told the Independent on Wednesday that she also saw the raid play out, and that she saw a bunch of people get tackled. She said that, after ICE took people away, the car wash was left open and people’s stuff were strewn about. She identified Rachel as a neighbor of the car wash, and said that Rachel and other staff helped close up the car wash after the raid.

The ICE raid was partially captured on video and posted on Instagram by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition. The video’s caption states that seven people were “confirmed” to have been detained by ICE officers around 10 a.m. on Wednesday.

Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA) organizer John Lugo went to Optimo Car Wash after hearing about the incident. He told the Independent Wednesday that he heard that ICE agents surrounded the store and seized seven people, including a ULA member. He said he was also told that a client of the car wash confronted ICE officers, who then tried to arrest her. Lugo was unsure if the client had actually been arrested.

Garrett drove to Optimo after hearing that ICE had detained people there. She said in a separate interview with the Independent that witnesses to the incident told her that seven people were taken, while the Hamden Police Department told her they heard the number was eight.

“We’re in the middle of contacting family members of those detained,” added Garrett.

Tina Colón Williams, the lawyer representing previously ICE-detained Wilbur Cross student Esdrás Zabaleta-Ramirez, learned about the incident from the family member of someone who was detained. “It’s all very sudden, and we’re still figuring out what’s going on,” said Colón Williams in an interview with the Independent. She heard either eight or nine people were seized.

Garrett convened the press conference about the incident at the Keefe Community Center in Hamden at 2:30 p.m. Roughly 30 people attended the presser.

Rev. Emily Scott from First Presbyterian Church in New Haven said that one person who was taken was a customer, and not a worker. She said that when she and the New Haven Immigrants Coalition showed up Wednesday morning, “the entire staff was gone with no trace.” Doors were locked and no one was there to talk with them.

At 2:58 p.m. Wednesday., U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro sent out an email press release about the Hamden ICE raid.

“Right now, I am focused on confirming the safety and status of those who were detained during the raid on a Hamden car wash today, as well as their family members, some of whom are school-age children,” she is quoted as saying in that press release. “The aggressive tactics used by ICE and endorsed by President Trump have escalated tensions with communities here and across the country, exacerbating fear. They are not making Americans any safer. I will continue to engage with local leaders and law enforcement to understand the basis for this raid and to ensure that the rights of these individuals and all Connecticut residents are respected.”

On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing.","Immigration judges are continuing to deny bond hearings for detainees in Iowa and throughout the country, despite being repeatedly overruled by federal district court judges.

Five weeks ago, immigration judges across the country formally adopted the U.S. Department of Justice’s new legal position that detainees suspected of entering the country illegally can be held in jail indefinitely without being afforded a hearing on whether they’re entitled to release on bond while their case is pending.

The immigration judges’ stance stems from a September 2025 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals agreeing with the Trump administration’s position that detainees are not entitled to such hearings.

The board’s decision endorsing that view has upended decades of past practice in which immigration judges — who are not part of the judicial branch, and are instead part of the executive branch and the DOJ — released individuals on bond in cases where the detainees were not considered a flight risk or a danger to the public.

In the past few months, hundreds of detainees have sought relief by seeking the intervention of U.S. District Court judges, arguing that being held under such circumstances is a violation of their right to due process.

In an overwhelming number of such cases, the federal judges have sided with the detainees, ordering the immigration judges to hold bond hearings at which the detainees can argue that their history, employment, family obligations or other circumstances warrant their temporary release on bond.

Despite those rulings in U.S. District Court, immigration judges continue to deny bond hearings, leading to even more federal court cases seeking injunctions.

More Iowa detainees seek court intervention

Among the most recent Iowa cases is that of Filemon Brito Barrajas, a citizen of Mexico who says he has lived in the United States for 20 years without legal status. Court records indicate Barrajas had no criminal record until July of this year, when he was jailed on a charge of contempt of court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement then issued a detainer for him, keeping him in jail after he’d served his sentence for contempt.

On Aug. 18, 2025, Barrajas requested a bond hearing, but was denied by an immigration judge who concluded he lacked jurisdiction, echoing the DOJ’s position on the issue.

Barrajas then took the matter to U.S. District Court, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its director, Kristi Noem, as well as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ and the Omaha Immigration Court.

Attorneys for Barrajas argued he was entitled to a hearing on the question of bond and that, in the alternative, he should be released from custody.

On Sept. 23, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa ordered that such a hearing be scheduled by the immigration court within seven days.

“District courts across the country have addressed arguments similar to – and often identical to – the ones raised here,” Locher wrote in his decision. “The overwhelming majority of these courts have concluded that aliens in the petitioners’ situation are … entitled to bond hearings.”

Locher’s decision was similar to that of many other judges in that while he found that Barrajas was entitled to argue for his release on bond, the issue of whether bond should be granted was for the immigration court, not a U.S. District Court judge, to decide.

“It is not the court’s prerogative to assume the role of the immigration judge by deciding bond or detention,” Locher wrote.

Another recent Iowa case involves Marua Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States, according to her lawyers, to escape some form of persecution. Shortly after coming to the United States, Reyes was given notice to appear in immigration court and was released on her own recognizance.

But on Sept. 2, 2025, while attending her regularly scheduled check-in appointment at the ICE office in Cedar Rapids, ICE officials allegedly canceled her notice to appear in immigration court, entered an order calling for her expedited removal from the country, and had her detained in the Muscatine County Jail.

On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing. A week later, on Oct. 7, 2025, attorneys for Reyes sought an emergency hearing on the matter in U.S. District Court, arguing the immigration court had violated her due process rights by denying her a hearing.

On Tuesday of this week, the Department of Justice sought and obtained a continuance in the case. Judge Locher has given the DOJ until Oct. 21 to file a response in the case.

The Barrajas and Reyes cases are among at least 20 such bond-hearing cases filed recently in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Because the final decisions on bond are still made within the immigration court system, the current status or outcome of the cases is difficult — and in some cases impossible — to track.

Federal judges rule against the DOJ

Last week, federal judges in the San Francisco area ordered the release of dozens of immigrants held in California detention facilities without a bond hearing. In each case, a U.S. District Court judge had already issued a temporary restraining order or an injunction granting the temporary release of the detainees until the bond-hearing issue could be resolved.

One federal judge in San Francisco, James Donato, recently expressed frustration when a DOJ lawyer argued in court that detainees have no right to a hearing in front of an immigration judge.

“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney. “Just give them a hearing … What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again, and again, and again, in front of every judge in this district?”

Two weeks ago, a U.S. District Court judge in the state of Washington ruled that the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings to detainees was unlawful. That Sept. 30 ruling was made in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in March 2025, challenging the then-new practice of denying bond hearings even to people who have lived in the United States for decades.

Other class-action lawsuits over the same issue, as well as the hundreds of individually filed cases, are still pending in courts throughout the United States.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-2048x1367.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 17:02:24.727456

Despite this explicit law, President Trump and Director Vought have continued to bully and target our dedicated federal workforce, including by threatening(link is external) to illegally withhold back pay after the shutdown ends. In a bipartisan letter to Director Vought, the lawmakers underscore that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which was passed and signed into law during the last shutdown under President Trump, is clear that all federal employees, whether they are excepted or furloughed, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends. There are more than 30,000 federal workers that reside in Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District.

“During the 2018-2019 shutdown, we worked with President Trump to enact the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, the intent of which is clear – federal employees are entitled to retroactive pay in the event of a government shutdown. We applauded President Trump for signing this bipartisan bill into law,” the members wrote.

“The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),” the members wrote. “OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens.”

The members continued, “The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.”

“We request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law,” the members concluded.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.
The Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025.
The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office.
Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.","The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday afternoon to approve a $3.57 million emergency allocation to dramatically scale up legal services, community outreach and rapid response networks for the county’s immigrant and refugee residents.

Sourced primarily from the Measure W Essential Services Fund, the allocation includes $2.5 million designated for immigrant and refugee support and an additional $1 million for a flexible contingency pool. The funds will extend and increase contracts for three frontline community coalitions.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.

Spearheaded by Supervisors Nikki Fortunato Bas and Elisa Márquez, the action is a direct response to what county staff reports describe as “exponentially more attacks” and “unprecedented levels” of federal immigration enforcement.

“This is about real-time response and building an infrastructure that will continue to educate and empower our communities to withstand this escalation of threats and attacks,” Márquez said.

Under the new federal budget, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is set to receive an additional $75 billion over four years, representing a more than 300% increase in enforcement and detention capacity.

Bas said that residents demanded greater support after a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows federal ICE agents to conduct stops based on perceived ethnicity, raising concerns about heightened racial profiling. The move also follows an incident last month where federal immigration officers detained a man inside an Oakland courthouse.

“With the surge in ICE arrests again, the targeting of our immigrant communities, the community has come to us to say it is urgent that we boost our capacity,” Bas said. “This will allow us to expand the rapid response hotline into the weekends and continue defending immigrants in our legal system to ensure they have due process.”

The six-month funding extension is designed to fortify the local safety net in a county where one in three residents is foreign-born and half of all children live in a mixed-status household, according to a letter from Bas and Márquez to the board recommending adoption.

Enforcement data for what ICE refers to as the San Francisco “Area of Responsibility,” which stretches from Kern County to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam and includes Alameda County, showed that immigration arrests doubled in early 2025.

This spike disproportionately impacts working-class families, particularly nationals from Mexico, Guatemala, India, El Salvador and Honduras, according to the supervisors’ letter.

The Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025. At Tuesday’s meeting, ACILEP said during the weekday, one staffer currently mans the phone at a time, highlighting the group’s limited capacity.

The $3.57 million will support the county’s three core partners in scaling their services:

ACILEP: The largest portion of the funding will support the expansion of the organization’s Rapid Response Hotline to operate on weekends and ensure 24/7 coverage, alongside bolstering legal services and community volunteer network coordination.

California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice: The funds will maintain removal defense capacity, offset filing fees for low-income clients and fund legal education and outreach—ensuring immigrants in removal proceedings have access to due process and legal protection.

Trabajadores Unidos Workers United: The group will use the funding to provide resources, mutual aid and community organizing opportunities to low-income immigrant workers and their families.

The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office. This funding will help offset skyrocketing immigration application and litigation fees for low-income clients, such as the recent significant increase in costs for asylum applications and green cards following the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budget bill.

Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.

“We definitely have to do more strategic planning and develop stronger infrastructure for the long term,” Márquez said.

Alameda County Together, an ad hoc committee prioritizing equity and inclusion for residents, recommended that the county establish such an office, which would be tasked with coordinating resources, overseeing immigrant-serving programs and advising the Board on responsive policies.

County staff have been directed to return to the Board on Oct. 21 with a comprehensive coordination plan, and again on Oct. 28. The county is engaging with philanthropy, including the San Francisco Foundation’s new initiative, the Stand Together Bay Area Fund, to support these initiatives.

“It’s really important that people have a sense of belonging in this county,” Márquez said. “By us investing in these services, to acknowledge the challenges that are occurring and finding a way to mitigate that, just reaffirms our commitment to being a space and inclusive community for everyone.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/09/250903-ICETRAINING_01023_TV-KQED.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:18.678943

According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants with legal counsel are nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief than those without representation.","The spike in immigration enforcement and raids has created a pressing demand for immigration legal resources, yet representation is often limited for those who need it across New York and the United States, according to immigration experts.

As of January, there were 4.5 million immigrants living in New York; 1.8 million were non-citizens and an estimated 670,000 lack documentation. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association New York Chapter, however, there are around 1,600 immigration lawyers in New York. The accessibility of legal representation for immigrant New Yorkers is severely disproportionate to the demand — an issue that extends nationwide.

New York City, however, has a much higher concentration of immigration lawyers, funding and general aid organizations compared to upstate, where many struggle to get the help they need.

“Not only is there a lack in professionals handling the cases, but it's also an issue of availability of funds,” said Syracuse immigration lawyer Jose Perez. “It all limits [a client’s] possibilities — not to mention the fact that if they speak a different language, it becomes more complicated.”

Fifty-seven workers were detained in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Cato in September. Of those 57, Hediberto Ramierz was detained and sent back to Guatemala despite his valid work permit, and pending immigration case. He says he never had an opportunity to consult his lawyer, and others detained are still without representation.

Immigration by the numbers

When President Trump entered office in January, the U.S. immigrant population was at a record high of 53.3 million, accounting for 15.8% of the population. Compared to this year, in 2011, 13% of the population were immigrants. Owing to the series of aggressive immigration initiatives this year, this high declined by 2 million. Immigrants now account for around 15.2% of the population. There are about 20,000 immigration lawyers in the U.S., according to IBIS World's 2025 industry analysis.

Jessica Maxwell is the executive director of the Workers Center of Central New York, a pro-immigrant worker group, and highlighted the organization's efforts while stressing the current difficulties within the legal sphere.

“There is a shortage of lawyers,” said Maxwell. It's hard enough to get representation and then there's this layer of tension, making it really difficult for people to find representation or communicate and effectively coordinate representation.”

Maxwell and her Syracuse-based team often refer immigrants to at least three lawyers at a time, so they “have a chance.” Immigration law all over the country lacks essential components for such catered representation — and numbers aren't the only issue.

Language barrier proves to be an issue

Language is one of the largest barriers preventing immigrants from accessing legal help. Maxwell and Perez both say immigration law reflects a pattern of systematic disadvantages for individuals who speak languages other than English.

“There is a lack of attorneys, not only in the area, but in the whole [state] of New York,” said Perez. “We have very limited attorneys that do immigration, and only a handful of attorneys that speak Spanish and do immigration.”

The general morale of immigration attorneys is at an all-time low, for many say the administration’s “violations of human rights"" neglect their legal efforts, according to Perez. Representation in immigration courts has seen a general decline. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group associated with Syracuse University, this decline highlights a 10% drop this year in representation for Arabic, Creole and Spanish speaking defendants when comparing the previous four fiscal years to 2025.

Although federal law requires the court to provide those who do not speak English with interpreters, it is not required to provide legal counsel. Success in the courtroom has proven significantly more likely with representation than without. According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants with legal counsel are nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief than those without representation. Yet, 2025 has revealed nationwide that only 38% of all immigration cases were represented.

While the current law calls for attentive legal defense, immigrants face a lack of comprehensive representation and are left to fend for themselves, Perez said.

Tai Shaw, a Vietnamese immigrant-turned-business owner and advocate living in Syracuse, says he sees the struggle daily in his clients — whom he prefers to call “neighbors.” Financial factors coincide with legal limitations. Despite the case matter, legal fees are expensive, a burden that falls hardest on immigrants.

“Financial hardship is not just for my people, but is a question for everybody, especially now with the new administration,” said Shaw, who has lived in Syracuse for 20 years.

Employment and immigration

Poverty rates among immigrants consistently lean higher than their American-born counterparts. Therefore, many immigrants rely on pro bono representation, said Maxwell. Yet, these waitlists are months or years long — an adverse trend in immigration law. Public interest law organizations are a solution for those struggling. They provide legal services for people who would otherwise lack proper representation, focusing on public good rather than profit. Yet in conservative, poorer and less populated or rural regions — areas typically heavily populated with immigrants — these resources are scarce and packed with people, according to studies done by UC Berkely.

“We have a few very excellent legal services organizations here in New York state, but they're just way over capacity,” said Maxwell. “They are unable to provide services to a lot of people, especially as we see immigration enforcement ramping up.”

Millions of immigrants choose to settle in New York, whether it be in the city’s prominent urban and poorer areas or upstate, which is primarily rural. In New York City alone, one in four New Yorkers live in poverty, according to an annual report from Robin Hood and Columbia University. Nationally, New York City is home to the largest population of immigrants, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. In upstate, Onondaga, Erie, Monroe, Albany and Oneida counties are the top five counties with the highest immigrant populations. Within these areas, Census data found high poverty and limited English proficiency are prevalent, serving as primary factors for receiving legal aid and employment.

Now that the Trump administration is actively prioritizing U.S.-born individuals, especially in the workforce, it has become increasingly difficult for both immigrants here legally and illegally to find jobs and escape poverty, advocates said.

“Our community has an extremely hard time getting jobs right now, and most don't have decent jobs,” said Shaw. “Factory workers, janitors, cleaning, assembly line. The majority of my people are working at Amazon because of the language barrier. They don't have to speak. They're just throwing boxes.”

Employment opportunity is paramount to immigrant poverty rates, further curbing accessibility to legal aid.

At a press conference concerning September’s Cato Nutrition Bar Confectioners Factory raid, acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III warned employers across New York not to employ unauthorized workers. He emphasized the unlawful employment of immigrants takes away opportunities from Americans. Sarcone pointed to the “high unemployment” rates in upstate New York, yet county unemployment is either lower or at the state average.

Perez, and many other experts, refuted Sarcone's — and the Trump administration’s — standpoints on immigrant employment. Perez’s work boils down to the crucial point that immigrants are not taking jobs from Americans but are working the ones U.S.-born workers are not willing to.

“How many Americans are picking foods in the farms around New York?” Perez asked. “You're not going to see a single person doing that. How many Anglo people are working in the kitchens, doing the dishes, or cleaning services in the hotels? If you spend a night in the hotel, you're not going to see white people cleaning rooms. They are going to see immigrants.”

Immigrant work is an integral part of the labor market, benefiting an economy all Americans work toward, Perez says, while also providing immigrants the money it takes to stay here and continue their economic contributions.

Maxwell emphasized that employment still doesn't solve every issue. Immigration enforcement is targeting all immigrants, whether they have legal status or not, making no immigrant, despite compliance with the system, immune, Maxwell said.

“I've had at least three people this week who have valid work permits and are working be detained,” said Maxwell. “They're losing that income right when they need it the most; to rely on legal services when there's no reason to believe they should have needed a lawyer.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UNY-Spec-EmilyKenny-JosePerez-20250909-001_1,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:01.177395

The federal government is planning on making the domestic spy agency’s powers for compulsory questioning permanent, while also significantly expanding the offences covered by the rules.

Introduced in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, the compulsory questioning powers would cover sabotage, promotion of communal violence, attacks on the defence system and serious threats to Australia’s border security.

But legislation introduced to parliament by the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, would also end so-called sunset provisions – the effective expiry dates that require parliament to reconsider the powers on a regular basis.

Under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, intelligence operatives have powers to issue a questioning warrant, requiring a person as young as 14 to give information or produce items that may assist in a serious investigation.

The powers are being temporarily extended, for 18 months, to allow parliament to consider a permanent expansion.

Asio has hardly used the powers since 2020. Just four warrants were served on three people, in counter-terror and espionage cases, in that time.

Guardian Australia revealed in July a review of the legislation was under way by parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security.

In a joint submission, Liberty Victoria and the New South Wales and Queensland councils for civil liberties say the plan would seriously diminish the right to a fair trial and risk Asio being characterised as a secret police force, rather than an intelligence agency.

They say the laws would unfairly allow the government to force an innocent person to undergo compulsory questioning, with their answers available for use by prosecutors.

“This creates an incentive for the executive to conduct ‘fishing expeditions’ against individuals who could not otherwise be investigated under ordinary criminal procedure,” their submission said.

It noted a 2016 review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor had recommended the powers be repealed or allowed to lapse.

The NSW Council for Civil Liberties’ president, Timothy Roberts, said the powers should be withdrawn.

“Any government interested in maintaining its identity as ‘democratic’ would not have laws with such far-reaching powers,” he said.

“It is alarming with all the recent international examples of the dangers of this type of overreach, our government has chosen not to shore up its citizens rights, and instead erode them.”

His Queensland counterpart, Michael Cope, said warnings about permanent damage to civil liberties after 9/11 were being shown to be justified.

“These are the powers of a police state. They are found in no other liberal democracy and must not be made permanent,” he said.

Asio has told the committee the questioning powers were a “unique and critical tool” for investigating threats.

The agency said the country faced “more security surprises” in the next five years than what has occurred in the past few years.

Espionage and foreign interference were at unprecedented levels, it said, while political violence represents an “elevated concern” amid growing political polarisation.

It also warned sabotage will pose an increasing challenge to authorities and could quickly escalate, and insisted powers to question minors were warranted.

“Given the increase in the prevalence of minors in Asio’s terrorism caseload – all attacks and major counter-terrorism disruptions in 2024 involved minors or young people – the numbers of minors being radicalised online, and the way minors are moving towards violence more quickly, Asio considers the retention of these powers is necessary and proportionate to the potential threat to security.”

The organisation offered a hypothetical scenario to illustrate its use of the powers, in which an Australian citizen was helping organise a people-smuggling operation offshore. In the scenario, the individual refuses to answer questions after returning to Australia, before being compelled under the laws. Their answers see a people-smuggling boat stopped before it reaches Australia.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71c0efa5ffeceff7f524094b20ac59b67c947ba4/472_0_4718_3775/master/4718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ee6badfc2d498fe61531741a1372dbe",N,,2025-10-15 16:04:05.791642

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump’s first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers’ jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.

WATCH: How the latest round of federal layoffs could impact public health

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.

Trump administration launches wave of layoffs

Farruggia is the head of the American Federation of Government Employees local representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency’s leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said.

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump’s budget office.

READ MORE: Amid shutdown fight, Trump no longer distancing himself from Project 2025

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don’t.”

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn’t fear a massive layoff during the shutdown.

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it’s codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won’t wait for me to eventually get paid.”

Shutdown drags on, and frustration grows

For some federal workers, this isn’t their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump’s first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn’t mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate.

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There’s no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can’t even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

Workers used as ‘political pawns’

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union’s members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn’t about one party or the other. It’s about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

WATCH: ‘Do your damn job,’ federal worker union leaders tell Congress mired in shutdown

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they’re not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

It’s time to rethink what we mean by “fixing” immigration—and work toward real solutions.

In the matter of K-E-S-G-, an asylum case decided by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals on July 18, Department of Justice officials declared that a Salvadoran woman stalked and threatened by gang members could not obtain asylum based solely on the argument that her persecution was due to her gender, despite occurring in a country that, she argued, views women as property.

The decision is the latest in a 30-year battle over the legitimacy of gender-based asylum claims and closely tracks the first Trump administration’s efforts to roll back decisions and policies that recognized the unique role gender plays in many asylum cases, particularly those involving domestic abuse, sexual violence or trafficking.

According to the attorneys representing S.G., while the decision does not prevent women from making gender-based asylum claims, it will make it much more difficult to prove them. Neela Chakravartula, associate director of litigation at the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and a co-counsel in the case, predicts that this new ruling will lead to more denials of women’s asylum claims since it “sends a strong signal to immigration judges that women’s asylum claims should not be taken seriously.”

Chakravartula said in a press briefing:

“This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has singled out women seeking asylum, and we know where this path leads. More judges denying protection to women who qualify for it. More refugees being deported to danger. Even more chaos and confusion injected into our immigration system.”

The Tahirih Justice Center’s Kursten Phelps, another co-counsel on S.G.’s case, expressed concern about the chilling effect the decision will have on many potential asylum seekers.

“This decision does not mean they are suddenly ineligible for asylum,” she noted. “But harmful rhetoric and decisions like this one are designed to deter them—and us—from even trying. We must not do their work for them. These cases are still winnable, and we owe it to survivors to keep fighting and affirm that their stories do count.”

Asylum law is complex, making it difficult to obtain asylum in the United States. You must demonstrate that you have been or will be persecuted based on a protected category, and that your own government will not or cannot help you. You must show that your persecutor intended to harm you because you are a member of the protected category. You must show that you can’t simply move to another part of your country and that your life is in danger if you return home.

If you demonstrate all these things based on the protected grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinion, you have a shot at winning your case. If someone is persecuting you because you are a woman, however, you also must prove that you are a member of a particular social group, one sufficiently distinct and separate from the general population of women in your country that your membership in this group makes you a target for some particular form of persecution.

Some asylum claims seem straightforward—persecution by the Russian government of a political dissident is tied to political opinion, while ethnic cleansing operations are persecution on account of race—but others are more complicated. Union membership, sexual orientation, gender, whistleblowing or geography can all be part of persecution claims that don’t necessarily fit under the delineated grounds.

Gender has been controversial, driven in large part by the fact that many forms of gender-based persecution are committed by private actors rather than by the government itself, and by fears of overwhelming the asylum system if gender is accepted as the basis for persecution without more evidence to distinguish the claim.

Since the Clinton administration, efforts to fully address gender have swung back and forth in U.S. courts; most advocates have pinned their hopes on regulations that would definitively address gender as part of a rule defining a “particular social group.” Those efforts have been thwarted politically in Democratic administrations and have been completely abandoned under the Trump administration.

The board’s decision in K-E-S-G- takes on deeper significance because it doesn’t simply reject the applicant’s definition of a particular social group. It goes further, declaring that gender is never sufficient on its own to demonstrate a protected class. In classic originalist form, the board pivoted to the 1950s, declaring that it could not recognize gender as a distinct protected class because it wasn’t part of the original group of five established at the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention.

However, an analysis of the Refugee Convention and its history argues for recognizing that protected groups can change over time and custom. It’s not that gender can’t be a protected category, but that gender must be tied to certain specifics that define a woman’s status in a particular country at a particular time. Given the state of the world, this should mean that gender-based claims would not require linguistic gymnastics to establish that a woman in El Salvador is likely at risk for persecution.

An obvious example is the condition of women in Afghanistan. Under Matter of K-E-S-G-, it appears that Afghan women fleeing the Taliban may not be considered a sufficiently specific group, despite the overwhelming threat to life and freedom women face in Afghanistan today. Afghan women refugees in the U.S., many of whom are still waiting for the government to keep its promises to protect them from the Taliban through permanent U.S. residence, are keenly aware of this possibility.

“When I learned about the decision in K-E-S-G-, I thought of our clients,” said Laila Ayub, cofounder and director of Project ANAR (the Afghan Network for Advocacy and Resources), a legal services organization founded to assist Afghan refugees. “With every new announcement from this administration, they reach out to us asking if they will face deportation. It is shameful that at a time when other countries are expanding protections for displaced peoples fleeing gender-based violence and persecution, this administration is weaponizing the immigration court system to further restrict them.”",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2194932514.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:03:30.226800

In this series, we will lay out how various federal and state actors are using the funding to attack our democracy, increase authoritarianism, expand the prison/military industrial complex, and negatively impact communities, families, and individuals.

On July 3, Republicans in Congress and President Trump elected to trade away billions of dollars for health care and anti-poverty programs to fund an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement, specifically in the form of detention. We are only beginning to see and feel the impacts of this tradeoff of care for cages, but reports are already rolling in.

For a clear illustration of this trade, we can look to a corner of rural Nebraska. The town of Curtis, Nebraska recently lost its rural hospital center following the 2025 reconciliation act’s enactment. The CEO of Community Hospital said in his statement about the closure that the anticipated federal funding cuts to Medicaid were a major deciding factor in closing their clinic. Community Hospital’s headquarters is located in McCook, Nebraska – about 45 minutes from Curtis. Trading away critical care for increased detention, the only investment that appears to be on the table is a new immigration detention site at the McCook Work Ethic Camp. The state of Nebraska intends to move the nearly 200 Nebraskans currently housed at the McCook facility for rehabilitative programming into other prisons, converting the facility into an immigration jail that would house up to 300 immigrants on any given day.

We all know that money talks – if it wasn’t clear to see before, this bill shows that the Trump administration and the members of Congress that voted to pass the 2025 reconciliation bill only have one goal: cruelty at any cost to deter future immigrants and push out those already here, no matter their ties to the country.

As a country, we want everyone to be healthy and have access to the care they need. We all want our kids to go to school and learn. We want everyone in this country to have the tools they need to thrive. The government had the opportunity to invest in health care, create jobs, and invest in our children’s education. But instead of using our taxpayer money to make those visions a reality, the reconciliation act slashed funding for basic safety net programs like Medicaid and anti-poverty programs and redirected more than $150 billion towards fueling Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. Here’s a quick breakdown:

$45 billion to detain immigrant adults and families

$75 billion in enforcement and surveillance funding for border communities, including $47 billion for construction of the border wall

$32 billion for immigration agents and operations related to enforcement and deportation

$13.5 billion for state and local enforcement of federal immigration law

$1 billion to divert military resources towards border militarization

This unprecedented slush fund for detention and enforcement comes at the expense of everyone’s wellbeing and economic stability.

The decisions made in the reconciliation bill spell out a dark future for the country: Hospitals will close. Millions of Medicaid recipients will lose access to their health care. The national deficit will balloon by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.

Meanwhile, the $45 billion awarded to ICE to jail immigrants is 13 times the government’s annual budget for immigration detention, which was already at a record high. The funding allocated to detention in the reconciliation bill is a moral failure and an existential threat.

State of Detention

The alarm has been ringing for decades about the inhumane, unsanitary, and deadly conditions inside immigration detention sites. From reports of rotten food, physical abuse, and over 230 documented deaths since 2003, the U.S. immigration detention system has been plagued with crisis-level concerns for years. Years of investigation from the media, advocates, and members of Congress into sites across the country document a disturbing pattern of abuse: physical and sexual abuse, denial of medical care (including mental health care), a lack of acceptable food and water, and restricted to non-existent access to legal counsel.

The history of ICE detention is rife with abuse, but we fear things are only going to get worse. With disturbing reports from inside detention sites documenting the rise in suicide attempts and deaths from medical neglect, it is no surprise that 2025 is on track to be one of the deadliest years on record.

The Trump administration’s expansion is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before: as of publication, ICE is holding 58,766 individuals in detention – with no sign of slowing down. As the Administration continues to carry out its goal of mass enforcement, advocates and organizers predict that the situation is about to get much worse.

There have been several stark developments as the Trump administration pushes for mass expansion, including:

The Everglades Detention Camp in Ochopee, Florida has been universally condemned as a human rights disaster – yet Trump officials still consider it the blueprint for future sites.

The opening of the largest federal detention site at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas is a massive expansion in a state that hosts over 20 detention sites. The soft-sided facility (a tent-like structure not designed for housing people for long periods of time will hold at least 1,000 individuals initially, with plans to expand capacity to 5,000.

Military facilities are being converted into detention sites across the country, including Camp Atterbury-Muscatatuck in Edinburgh, Indiana; Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas; and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Trenton, New Jersey.

An ACLU investigation revealed plans for six potential new sites in Colorado – marking a 600% increase in detention in the state.

Private prison companies, namely GEO Group and CoreCivic, currently manage sites that hold 90% of detained immigrants, meaning there is even less transparency into the conditions and less oversight into their management than government-run facilities.

Small rural towns are the prime target for new and expanded immigration detention sites. Private prison corporations and the federal government are predatory, promising economic revitalization and an influx of jobs to areas struggling with high unemployment and budget shortfalls. But in reality, these sites cause more harm in the surrounding community than good.

The Trump Administration calls H.R. 1 the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), but the truth is that this bill is far from beautiful. It is ugly, shortsighted, and it will take generations of advocacy to undo the pain it is causing for immigrants and their families. More immigration detention means more parents ripped away from their children, economic and health instability for the families left behind, and more people placed in life-threatening situations hidden behind the walls of detention.

As time goes on, it will become even more important to have a written record that documents the scope, harm, and significance of the reconciliation act’s funding for detention. In the next few entries to this blog series, we will examine how the act’s funds impact ICE-run sites, private-run sites, state-run sites, and detention facilities at military sites. Using first-hand accounts, news reporting, and research into detention conditions, we will continue to witness the devastating impacts of reconciliation act funding.

In a 4-1 vote, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the measure, according to The Associated Press.

The emergency declaration will ensure funds are provided to local residents for rental assistance and legal aid because some immigrants have stopped going to work in an effort to avoid being taken by immigration officials.

“We have residents afraid to leave their homes, we have constituents contacting my office because their family members never came home and they don’t know if they’ve been taken by ICE or where they’ve been taken,” County Supervisor Janice Hahn said, per the AP.

“We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers have been taken from their work places and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on their table,” she added.

Migrant workers have been targeted through raids at farms, places of business and at their homes.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger was the sole person to dissent on the board, warning the declaration could harm landlords and open the county to legal challenges.

Rent arrangements offered by the county during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred a whirlwind of legal cases from landlords.

Daniel Yukelson, CEO of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, told AP that landlords lost billions in uncollected rent during the COVID-19 emergency.

The county’s move marks the latest effort by California officials to push back on President Trump’s immigration crackdown in the state.

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued new legislation banning ICE agents from wearing masks.

He said face coverings allow federal law enforcement agents to be “hidden from accountability” arguing masks prevent “transparency” for citizens and hinder “oversight.”

Residents have protested against ICE raids as the Department of Homeland Security said 5,000 immigrants in the country illegally were arrested from June to August in Los Angeles.

Multiple airports in Texas are refusing to play a video at their security checkpoints in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blames Democrats for the ongoing federal government shutdown, citing advertising policies that bar the use of political content.

Airports commonly display videos from the head of homeland security on screens at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, but these messages are usually apolitical. This changed when Department of Homeland Security officials directed TSA to display a video that begins with Noem outlining TSA’s priorities and ends with her expressing hope that “Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”

“Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government,” Noem says in the video. “Because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”

Spokespeople for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas Love Field Airport, Corpus Christi International Airport and San Antonio International Airport told The Texas Tribune that the video is not on display at their TSA checkpoints.

Dallas Fort Worth International Airport’s decision to not display the video is consistent with its longstanding policy that prohibits political advertising, said Zachary Greiner, a spokesperson for the airport.

Dallas Love Field Airport’s advertising policy also “prohibits political or issue-oriented content,” said spokesperson Patrick Clarke. Additionally, the airport has not received the permit application required for such videos.

Corpus Christi International Airport and San Antonio International Airport are also not running the video at this time, according to statements from the airports that did not include explanations.

Jacquelyn Eckmann, a spokesperson for Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, said the airport’s checkpoints do not have the ability to display the video because they are not equipped with video monitors.

TSA is displaying the video at its security checkpoint at El Paso International Airport, said spokesperson Tammy Fonce.

The Houston Airport System did not respond to an inquiry about whether they were showing Noem’s message.

As of May 2022, TSA employed nearly 50,000 officers across the country, with more than 4,000 in Texas, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most of these workers are required to work without pay during government shutdowns.

This has contributed to staffing shortages and flight delays across the country, including at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Monday.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Texas Tribune that the government shutdown has created challenges for TSA employees, but that security operations are largely unchanged.

“It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,” she said.

United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld the FTC commissioners’ removal protections.
The Slow Death of Humphrey’s Executor The first question presented in Trump v. Slaughter asks whether the Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor.
Shortly after Myers, the Supreme Court jettisoned much of Taft’s reasoning in Humphrey’s Executor.
The majority in Humphrey’s Executor affirmatively “disapproved” of Taft’s strongest statements in Myers and characterized them as nonbinding dicta.
First, Roberts has explained that Humphrey’s Executor permitted Congress to “create expert agencies led by a group of principal officers removable by the President only for good cause.” Roberts’s description of Humphrey’s Executor is much narrower than the description offered in Morrison.","For almost 140 years, removal protections have been the hallmark of independence for multimember commissions like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). By statute, the president may remove FTC commissioners only “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” President Trump did not cite any of these reasons when, in March 2025, he removed FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Instead, he argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and, therefore, the FTC’s removal protections could not constitutionally constrain his power to remove them. Trump has also removed commissioners at other independent agencies, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board, in violation of statutory removal protections.

Trump’s actions directly conflict with Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld the FTC commissioners’ removal protections. By removing Slaughter and Bedoya without cause, Trump overstepped his statutory authority and violated Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, Judge Loren AliKhan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment in favor of Slaughter, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit refused to stay that decision.

The U.S. Supreme Court, however, stayed the district court’s decision, allowing Trump to remove Slaughter during the pendency of the case. Simultaneously, the Court granted certiorari on two issues: first, “Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), should be overruled,” and second, “Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.”

Scholars largely anticipate that the Supreme Court will narrow or overturn Humphrey’s Executor in Trump v. Slaughter, but the degree to which the Supreme Court will carve back Humphrey’s Executor remains unclear. Regardless, Slaughter will carry significant consequences for public administration.

The Slow Death of Humphrey’s Executor

The first question presented in Trump v. Slaughter asks whether the Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor. The Constitution discusses the removal of officers only in conferring the impeachment power upon Congress. Although Article II grants the president the power to nominate principal officers of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate, nothing in the Constitution explicitly grants them the power to remove these officers. Whether the president has the power to remove subordinates and whether Congress may restrict that power remains one of the most hotly contested issues in constitutional law.

Although silent on the question of removal, Article II vests the “executive power” in “a President of the United States.” Proponents of unitary executive theory argue that the “executive power” vested by Article II necessarily includes the right to control subordinates within the executive branch. Many proponents view the power to remove subordinate officers as a residual feature of the “executive power” inherited by the president from the British Crown. Others have alternative theories about why Article II confers the removal power. Of course, opponents of unitary executive theory—and even some of its proponents—argue that the Vesting Clause confers no removal power and that Congress’s power over agency design allows for removal protections.

Those who believe the Constitution necessarily confers the removal power upon the president draw support from the Supreme Court’s decision in Myers v. United States. In that case, Chief Justice William Taft—himself once president—held that “the power of removal of executive officers was incident to the power of appointment.” His decision follows a similar logic as unitary executive theory. Presidents rely on subordinates to execute the law, and, therefore, they have the power to appoint their agents. Consequently, presidents must also have the power to remove these agents when they fail to faithfully execute the law.

In various cases before Myers, however, the Supreme Court held that Congress could restrict removal for inferior officers. In Ex Parte Hennen, the Court upheld the removal of a district court clerk but implied that statutory law could limit removal. In United States v. Perkins, the Court held that Congress may limit the removal of inferior officers when it vests their appointment in the heads of departments. The Court reasoned, “The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enact in relation to officers so appointed.” Taft narrowly construed these precedents in Myers, reasoning that the different appointment mechanisms for inferior officers grant Congress greater control over the removal of inferior officers.

Shortly after Myers, the Supreme Court jettisoned much of Taft’s reasoning in Humphrey’s Executor. Relying on the precedent set in Myers, President Franklin Roosevelt removed FTC Commissioner William Humphrey, who enjoyed for-cause removal protections. The majority in Humphrey’s Executor affirmatively “disapproved” of Taft’s strongest statements in Myers and characterized them as nonbinding dicta. In upholding the removal protections, the Court reasoned that the FTC “cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive”:

To the extent that it exercises any executive function—as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense—it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government.

The precise rule of Humphrey’s Executor has confused both scholars and jurists. In Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court more or less abandoned the quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative categories it used to justify removal protections for multimember commissions. According to the Court, “the real question is whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty”—not whether the official exercises “purely executive” power rather than “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” power.

Together, Myers and Humphrey’s Executor appeared to stand for the proposition that the president possesses the power to remove principal officers by default, but Congress could expressly restrict that power in specific circumstances. The Court’s decision in Wiener v. United States complicated this rule by holding that some agencies possess implied removal protections. The petitioner—an adjudicator of the War Claims Commission—argued that his removal by the president was unlawful, even though the War Claims Act did not expressly restrict his removal. Drawing from Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court concluded that the president had no constitutional authority to remove commissioners of an adjudicatory body and that statutory silence did not implicitly confer the removal power upon the president. Wiener allowed for the possibility that officers without express removal protections, like commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enjoyed impliedremoval protections.

The Roberts Court has chipped away at Congress’s power to restrict removal and simultaneously expanded the president’s control over principal officers. In Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Congress created the PCAOB as an entity within the SEC but limited the SEC commissioners’ ability to remove their appointees to the PCAOB. For the sake of argument, the Supreme Court assumed that the SEC commissioners also enjoyed removal protections. Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion reasoned that these “double for-cause removal protections” impermissibly insulated PCAOB members from presidential oversight. The Court emphasized that Article II requires the president to remain politically accountable for executive action, and such accountability dissipates if inferior officers are insulated not once, but twice, from presidential control.

In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Court went further by invalidating removal protections for the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB’s statute permitted the president to remove its single director only “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that such a restriction on removal was unconstitutional when applied to a single-headed agency wielding substantial executive authority. In Collins v. Yellen, the Court extended Seila Law by holding that the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s single-director structure with for-cause removal protection likewise violated Article II, reaffirming that such insulation is incompatible with presidential accountability. The Office of Legal Counsel subsequently concluded that Collins permitted the president to remove the Social Security commissioner at will.

In all three cases, Chief Justice Roberts described the precedent as recognizing only two exceptions to the president’s general removal authority: the Humphrey’s Executor exception for multimember commissions and the Perkins exception for inferior officers. First, Roberts has explained that Humphrey’s Executor permitted Congress to “create expert agencies led by a group of principal officers removable by the President only for good cause.” Roberts’s description of Humphrey’s Executor is much narrower than the description offered in Morrison. Second, Roberts has emphasized that “Congress could provide tenure protections to certain inferior officers with narrowly defined duties.” Yet Roberts declined to clarify what types of responsibilities qualify as “narrowly defined duties.”

By the beginning of Trump’s second term, many legal scholars regarded Humphrey’s Executor as effectively on life support. That perception was reinforced when the Supreme Court stayed a district court order enjoining the removal of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In an unsigned, two-page opinion in Trump v. Wilcox, the Supreme Court concluded that “the Government [was] likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.” The majority, however, stopped short of deciding whether those agencies fell within the Humphrey’s Executor exception. Nevertheless, it felt the need to recognize a new exception for the Federal Reserve—an agency not before the Court—reasoning that the “Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” Such an originalist-inspired carve-out would have been unnecessary if Humphrey’s Executor remained firmly intact.

The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn—or at least substantially narrow—Humphrey’s Executor. How far the Court intends to extend the president’s removal power remains uncertain, and any prediction is fraught. Roberts authored the majority opinions in Free Enterprise and Collins, adopting a characteristically incrementalist approach to changing precedent. Yet Roberts is no longer the pivotal vote in the conservative majority. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have openly called for overruling Humphrey’s Executor. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism about the decision, though scholars debate whether he would vote to overturn it. Justice Samuel Alito, who authored Collins, has not indicated whether he would support overruling Humphrey’s Executor. Justice Amy Coney Barrett has yet to write in a case involving removal protections. The coming term will reveal whether the Court is prepared to dismantle Humphrey’s Executor outright or continue its gradual erosion.

The narrowest path forward could preserve Humphrey’s Executor while distinguishing the modern FTC on factual grounds. Today’s FTC exercises greater power than it did in 1935, raising questions about whether it exercises “substantial executive authority” rather than “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” functions. The D.C. Circuit has interpreted the Trade Commission Act as providing broader authority than originally anticipated, and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act greatly expanded the FTC’s jurisdiction over consumer protection. This incrementalist approach would preserve the core holding of Humphrey’s Executor but would require lower courts to undertake the fraught task of parsing agency functions to decide whether a given agency exercises “substantial executive authority.”

Alternatively, the Court could simply overturn Humphrey’s Executor, striking down removal protections for most multimember commissions. As suggested by its rhetoric in Trump v. Wilcox, the Court seems poised to recognize an exception for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Effectively, the Court may preserve removal protections for entities or officers that had some sort of analog at the Founding. (Such a test, however, has its own problems with respect to the Federal Reserve.)

As discussed below, the demise of Humphrey’s Executor would be immensely consequential, but its ripple effects may prove even greater in subsequent cases. Trump has already removed members of the Senior Executive Service—who are plausibly inferior officers—raising questions about the viability of Perkins and its exception for inferior officers. Judge James Ho of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has likewise suggested that the courts should reconsider whether tenure protections for federal employees violate Article II. Taken to its extreme, Slaughter could become the catalyst for dismantling long-standing civil service protections.

Remedies in Removal Cases

The second question presented in Trump v. Slaughter concerns the appropriate remedy in cases involving the removal of a federal official. The petitioners in Perkins, Myers, and Humphrey’s Executor sought back pay. (In fact, Humphrey died during litigation.) Recently, however, commissioners and former employees have sought to enjoin their removal from office. Whether courts have the authority to provide injunctive relief to principal officers has yet to be decided.

The remedy has significant consequences for the petitioners and the administration of government. In general, most commissioners are motivated to retain the power of their positions—not their modest government salaries. Until his death, Humphrey insisted he remained an FTC commissioner and retained authority to exercise its duties. Injunctive relief provides removed officials with the remedy they truly seek and incentivizes them to bring actions aimed at enforcing statutory limitations on removal.

Without interim relief, however, removal may cause instability. Suppose the president appoints a successor who occupies the office pending the resolution of litigation. Depending on the willingness of courts to preliminarily enjoin removal, the position may flip between the removed officer and the president’s preferred appointee throughout litigation. Thus far, the Supreme Court has suggested that it would not allow courts to preliminarily enjoin removals. In Trump v. Wilcox, the majority described its stay of the district court’s injunction as “reflect[ing] our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”

In a forthcoming article, Samuel Bray develops a remedial framework for officer removal cases that helps explain why the second question in Trump v. Slaughter is so significant. He argues that the best remedy for a wrongfully removed officer is typically declaratory relief—through a declaratory judgment or quo warranto—because such judgments definitively resolve the officer’s legal entitlement to office without requiring courts to manage the executive branch directly. On interim relief, Bray emphasizes what he calls the “anti-flipping principle”: courts should minimize the instability created when control of an office toggles back and forth during litigation. To achieve that, he proposes a presumption that officers who sue immediately to contest their removal should remain in place as de facto officers pending judgment, while those who delay should not be restored through preliminary injunctions. This approach, grounded in historical equity practice and the de facto officer doctrine, seeks to deter opportunistic removals by the president while avoiding the chaos of repeated turnovers in officeholders.

The debate over remedies is not abstract—the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook illustrates the stakes. President Trump’s attempt to oust Cook without cause raised precisely the instability that Bray identifies. If the courts lacked authority to provide interim relief, Cook could have been removed, replaced, and then reinstated after months of litigation, creating “flips” in officeholders at the very heart of monetary policy. Such turnover risks undermining market confidence and the Fed’s institutional credibility. By contrast, adopting Bray’s anti-flipping principle would mean that, because Cook immediately sued to contest her removal, she should remain as a de facto officer until the litigation concludes. This approach preserves continuity in the governance of the Federal Reserve while still leaving open the possibility of judicial resolution on the merits.

In a brief, unsigned order issued on Oct. 1, the Supreme Court deferred Trump’s request for a stay in Trump v. Cook. Consequently, Cook will remain in office at least until the Supreme Court hears arguments in January 2026. The Supreme Court did not explain why it granted Trump’s request in Slaughter but denied it in Cook. Presumably, its decision relates to the fact that a majority believes that the Federal Reserve’s removal protections are constitutional, while the FTC’s protections are not. The federal government does not technically challenge the Federal Reserve’s removal protections in Trump v. Cook, but the Court will likely distinguish (at least in dicta) its decision in Slaughter from Cook based on its reasoning in Trump v. Wilcox. Nevertheless, the Court will still need to decide whether the Federal Reserve’s officers are entitled to a hearing before their removal.

Whatever the court decides in Slaughter and Cook, the Supreme Court’s answer to the remedy question should have less impact on federal civil servants. When a federal employee is unlawfully removed, the statutory framework provides both a right to challenge the action and a remedy of reinstatement with back pay. Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, employees may appeal removals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has the authority to order reinstatement if the action is found unlawful. Likewise, employees found “to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action” must receive back pay and benefits, effectively restoring them to the status quo ante. Because Congress has specified statutory remedies for civil servants, civil servants do not need to rely on the equitable powers of the court for relief.

Implications

In all likelihood, Slaughter and Cook will reshape the relationship between the president and independent agencies. The precise implications of the decision depend on the course the Supreme Court takes.

Before discussing how Slaughter affects administration within the executive branch, it is worth examining its implications for the relationship between the president and the Supreme Court. Some commentators predict that Trump will defy a ruling by the Supreme Court. Preserving its institutional authority requires the Court to assert clearly and forcefully that the president is bound to respect its precedent.

Yet Trump has openly defied existing precedent by removing the FTC commissioner. Even if the Supreme Court ultimately intends to narrow or overturn Humphrey’s Executor, its failure to check the president’s defiance risks signaling that the Court’s precedents can be ignored until formally enforced. The Court could have sent a stronger message about the rule of law by staying the district court’s decision, reinforcing that precedent binds the executive until the Court itself says otherwise. The decision signals that precedent binds only when the Court chooses to enforce it—undermining the idea of stare decisis, which holds that courts should decide cases according to prior precedents.

Ultimately, Slaughter may have little practical effect on the president’s ability to control multimember commissions. Survey research by Neal Devins and David Lewis suggests that—contrary to popular wisdom—independent commissions are not particularly insulated from White House influence. Todd Phillips demonstrates that control over commission chairs grants the president considerable control over the day-to-day operations of these agencies. Anecdotal evidence illustrates the degree of control presidents already exercise over most independent agencies. The Federal Communications Commission promulgated net neutrality regulations during the Obama administration, only to repeal those regulations during the first Trump administration. Extending the removal power may not meaningfully improve the president’s ability to exercise control over these agencies.

That does not mean, however, that independent agencies will experience no change. The organic statutes governing many multimember commissions, including the FTC, require presidents to appoint members of both parties to the commission. Members of these commissions also serve a staggered period of a fixed number of years. Structural features such as partisan-balancing and staggered terms are rendered less effective by an unfettered removal power.

Moreover, multimember commissions have quorum rules that require the presence of a majority of commissioners to conduct business. As Todd Phillips and I argue in a forthcoming article, expansion of the removal power enables presidents to break quorums. Depriving commissions of a quorum matters most for adjudicatory commissions, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board. Parties appearing before adjudicatory commissions typically must exhaust their claims before these adjudicatory commissions before filing a claim in federal court. Without a quorum, parties’ cases go undecided, and they remain trapped in adjudicatory limbo until the president nominates and the Senate confirms a sufficient number of commissioners.

Overturning Humphrey’s Executor could also weaken administrative capacity within independent agencies. On average, these agencies employ more skilled workforces than cabinet departments, in part because their institutional structures preserve the autonomy that attracts talented professionals to federal service. These same structures may reduce politicization within independent agencies—another leading cause of retention problems. In interviews I conducted around the 2020 election, early-career federal employees frequently expressed a preference for independent agencies over cabinet departments, favoring the perceived stability of these agencies. Slaughter may erode the advantage independent agencies enjoy in the job market, undermining their ability to recruit and retain qualified employees. And if the Supreme Court ultimately extends the decision to eliminate tenure protections for all career staff, the resulting instability could drastically impair the ability of the federal government to recruit and retain qualified individuals.

Regardless of whether unitary executive theory is ultimately correct that removal protections violate Article II, these protections have been central to the administrative state for nearly 140 years. Abolishing them will reshape the administration of many federal agencies. The degree of change, however, will depend on how far the Supreme Court ultimately extends the president’s removal power—whether in Slaughter or subsequent cases.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 13:57:21.525053
