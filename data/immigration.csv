As bipartisan frustration with the strikes mounts, the Senate was voting Wednesday on a war powers resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.

The military has carried out at least four strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs, including three it said originated from Venezuela. It said 21 people were killed in the strikes.

The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce “hard evidence"" that the vessels were carrying drugs.

The administration has not explained why it has blown up vessels in some cases, while carrying out the typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs at other times, one of the officials said.

The Republican administration in a retroactive memo justifying one of the strikes last month declared drug cartels to be “unlawful combatants” and said the United States is now in an “armed conflict” with them.

The declaration has raised stark questions about how Trump intends to use his war powers. It also has been perceived by several senators as pursuing a new legal framework to carry out lethal action and has raised questions about the role of Congress in authorizing any such action.

Trump Administration Points to Videos as Proof

Asked about the lack of underlying evidence provided to Congress, the Pentagon on Wednesday pointed to videos of the strikes, which do not confirm the presence of drugs.

The Pentagon also noted public statements by Hegseth, including a social media post following the latest fatal strike in which he said, “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”

Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or even detailing which criminal organizations it claims as “unlawful combatants.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi was pressed at a Senate hearing Tuesday about what advice she's provided Trump to legally justify the strikes. She said, “I’m not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may or may not have given or issued at the direction of the president.""

A White House official suggested that lawmakers were being disingenuous with their criticism and that the Trump administration has been “much more forthcoming” with the legal rationale than Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration was when it carried out strikes targeting militants in the Middle East.

The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Pentagon officials have held six separate classified briefings to Congress on the operations.

Trump administration officials have argued that the strikes are necessary acts of self-defense as cartels funnel drugs into the United States that they say are leading to thousands of U.S. deaths. While Venezuela produces cocaine, the bulk of it is sent to Europe.

A Few in the Administration Are Said to Be Driving the Push for Strikes

Trump has largely bypassed traditional interagency processes in formulating his strategy to carry out strikes against drug cartels, according to the U.S. officials and a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

A small group of top administration officials — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Trump aide Stephen Miller — has driven the push to carry out the fatal strikes, officials said.

Rubio, dating back to his days in the Senate, has advocated for taking a harder line on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.""

Trump has focused attention on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which he claims is serving as “front” for Maduro, and said members of the gang were in the first boat targeted last month. No details on alleged affiliations have been released in the three other strikes.

Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term in January despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won by more than a two-to-one margin.

A Pause in Diplomacy

Early in his term, however, Trump dispatched special envoy Richard Grenell to Caracas to meet with Maduro. Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed by Maduro's government during Grenell's visit.

But diplomatic efforts with Caracas have been largely paused in recent months, with Grenell mostly sidelined, said the person familiar with the matter and a congressional aide, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Maduro says the boat strikes are an attempt to undercut his authority and try to foment unrest that would lead to his ouster from power.

The State Department pushed back against the notion that the administration had been involved in anything other than an operation targeting drug traffickers.

“Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans and we want to see him brought to justice,"" said Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman. ""The U.S. is engaged in a counter-drug cartel operation and any claim that we are coordinating with anyone on anything other than this targeted effort is completely false.”

Almost the first thought I had, in watching videos of federal agents snatching campus protesters and opinion writers, among many others seized somewhat violently on camera this year, was about what looked like a new anonymity protocol. There were agents wearing masks and others without visible name tags or badges, many operating in plain clothes. Why were so many of these agents trying to hide their identities?

“ICE goes masked for a single reason — to terrorize Americans into quiescence,” a federal judge, William Young, wrote in a blistering 161-page First Amendment ruling handed down last week. “In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police,” he continued. The judge, a Reagan appointee, compared immigration agents to “cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan” and declared that federal efforts to deport outspoken protesters amounted to a “full-throated assault” on freedom of speech. “Carrying on in this fashion, ICE brings indelible obloquy to this administration and everyone who works in it.”

Is this a true secret police? The term is darkly tempting, though much of what we’ve observed from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection this year has fallen distressingly within the bounds of our brutally capacious immigration law. The National Guard deployments, too, have unfolded in public view. The terroristic sweep of President Trump’s mass deportation program will be repeatedly litigated in the years to come, in courts of both law and public opinion — U.S. citizens arrested by agents apparently uninterested in their immigration status, agents drawing guns on civilian bystanders. And to the extent that many of those officers and their superiors have been not just enforcing laws and executive orders but also engaging in a kind of conspicuous and public cosplay, the costumes they have chosen are those of the enforcement arm of an authoritarian regime. When the masks came on, the mask came off.

The cosplay is now bleeding into state violence, and even for those used to pointing fingers and calling out authoritarianism, the past week has been a precipitous escalation: Trump speaking of the “enemy from within” as a national defense strategy waiting for approval proposes focusing the military on domestic threats and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, compares political opposition to terrorism; a military-style raid on a Chicago apartment complex; local police officers hit with tear gas from ICE agents.

The footage continued through the weekend, much of it horrifying. But at least we saw it.

***

Last Friday, the 48-year-old Emmy-winning reporter Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador from an ICE detention facility in Folkston, Ga. He was held in detention there for over 100 days. The state’s filings concerning his detention seem to largely focus on the crime of committing journalism.

Guevara was arrested in June at a No Kings rally outside Atlanta, where, while filming the protest for his livestreaming platform MG News, he (clearly wearing a press vest and keeping his distance from both protesters and law enforcement) briefly stepped into a roadway. Within days, the charges against him were dropped. But instead of being released, he was transferred to ICE custody. And although an immigration judge granted him bond, finding him neither dangerous nor a flight risk, the government appealed it, arguing that his recording of law enforcement activity itself constituted a danger. And so Guevara — whose work primarily documents immigration enforcement actions, which he often livestreams to hundreds of thousands of followers — was kept in ICE detention. Meanwhile, his immigration case was reopened, and eventually deportation proceedings commenced.

When the Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil was detained in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Khalil’s participation in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza amounted to a deportable threat to American foreign policy. The administration appeared to offer a similar argument about Rumeysa Ozturk — seemingly confirming that she had been detained for activism, namely by being a writer of a campus opinion piece criticizing her university for its response to Israel’s war in Gaza, and that she should be deported for that speech crime.

Both of those First Amendment cases still hang in a kind of judicial limbo, though Khalil and Ozturk are — for now, at least — free. Guevara is not, having been sent from the country in which he raised a family and built a news organization for years back to the one he left fearing persecution for his reporting in 2004. “It’s a real frontal attack on journalism and freedom of the press,” said Jose Zamora of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “I think it also shows you how all these democratic institutions that take hundreds of years to build can be dismantled in a year.”

The immigration side of Guevara’s case is complicated. Technically, authorities are given broad discretion in deciding deportation cases. By contrast, the detention that enabled those deportation proceedings to begin again is not complicated. “There’s no real crime here. It’s just pretext,” said Adam Rose, the press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club and the deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “That was totally in retaliation for his reporting,” said the A.C.L.U’s Scarlet Kim, one of Guevara’s lawyers in his recent proceedings. “The government has made that explicitly clear.”

Over the past six months, federal officials have again and again declared that documenting immigration enforcement activities by ICE agents is, by definition, a form of doxxing, which they describe not only as a form of harassment or even effectively an incitement to violence but also as the equivalent of violence. Such activity, they promised, would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last month federal prosecutors made good on the threat, issuing an indictment against three activists for doxxing ICE agents in August.

Students of political theory sometimes define the state as the entity that exercises a monopoly on violence; under Trump, the state seems to want to claim a monopoly on anonymity, too. Rose called the logic Orwellian. “It’s almost like doublespeak to say that filming is violence,” he said. “That is absurd. What filming does isn’t violence. It documents violence. It actually proves what really happened.”

Of course, there has been real violence against journalists since Trump returned to office, as well, not just arguments about whether Jimmy Kimmel should be on the air. During the protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles this June, more than 30 incidents of police violence against members of the media were documented by the Los Angeles Press Club, which last month won a remarkable injunction in a Federal District Court in California, in which the judge, Hernán Vera, had to detail that law enforcement could not attack or assault members of the press just for documenting a raid or protest. Vera described the attacks during the protests as “savagery.”

And in recent weeks, the violence has seemed to enter a new phase or perhaps merely a more visible one. On Sept. 28 an ICE agent fired a pepper ball at the car of a television journalist surveying a detention facility for signs of protest, of which there were none. On Sept. 30 at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, ICE agents shoved journalists to the floor, sending one to the hospital, just a week after a similar episode at the same facility led to the suspension of one agent — and only briefly.

And last Thursday in Portland, Ore., the conservative journalist Nick Sortor was arrested while documenting a protest against ICE — producing an immediate wave of right-wing outrage and, reportedly, a promise by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that her department would surge resources to the city. Elsewhere in the city, ICE agents pepper-sprayed a woman who seemed to be filming them on her phone. In Chicago, ICE agents were accused of making bogus calls to the police, saying that people were tampering with a detention facility’s gate. (Police officers quickly determined the people were there only to observe.) A Chicago City Council member was arrested after asking whether the agents had a warrant for someone they’d detained. “If arresting an elected official for peacefully asking questions isn’t a demonstration of authoritarianism, then what is?” Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois asked. “They seem to feel they can just willy-nilly shoot tear gas canisters at people and shoot them with foam rounds that can permanently maim people,” said Rose. “They’ve done this over and over.”

To a degree, the pattern follows a global trend. The U.N. has been warning about increasing violence and hostility toward the press for many years, with killings of journalists up 38 percent in 2022 and 2023 from the two previous years. More than 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict there — a figure much higher than in previous wars — making it, the Committee to Protect Journalists said, “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists” that the organization had ever documented. What makes this even more remarkable is that Israel has largely blocked foreign reporters from entering Gaza since the conflict began.

It also reflects an increasing porousness about the term “journalist” and what we even mean by it in 2025, when almost anyone holding a phone can claim to be doing journalism, including many of those superficially indistinguishable from protesters (who, it pains me to have to say, should enjoy robust First Amendment protections in the United States, too). That porousness also means that category distinctions can be made pretty arbitrary — not just between observers and activists but also between the groups the online right likes to distinguish, citing Carl Schmitt, as friend and enemy. “There is an authoritarian playbook, and it has different steps,” said Zamora. “And it has started happening here in a very fast way.”

At various points over the past decade, nervous Americans sometimes told themselves certain calming stories about the threat of Trumpism — that liberal hysteria was a bigger threat to democracy, that the lesson of his first term was that incompetence stymied ideology, that popularity would be a check and that the courts would be trusted to ultimately hold.

ICE’s budget for the 2025 fiscal year is now set to roughly triple from the year before, as is its number of deportation officers, and Stephen Miller, Trump’s top domestic policy adviser, does not appear inclined to defer to surveys of public opinion when it comes to deportations and border enforcement. Democrats have come a long way since “Abolish ICE,” too, with many pivoting pretty hard on immigration in recent years.

In certain moments from certain vantages, the proceedings can look like incompetence, with all the Sturm und Drang of Trump’s policies producing far fewer than his desired one million deportations and a high-profile monthlong operation in Chicago yielding just more than 1,000 arrests. On social media, it can even look like farce — someone flinging a Subway sandwich at Customs and Border Protection officers in D.C., someone else cursing the president and then scooting off on his bike as Border Patrol agents chased on foot in downtown Chicago, a crowd surrounding and shaming two agents as they wrestled a man to the ground on the South Side, eventually getting them to flee.

But these are not the clips we are meant to see. For that, we have a beautiful, high-production-value hype video full of portentous music, documenting an apartment raid, that Noem posted to social media over the weekend. “Chicago, we’re here for you,” she wrote.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/opinion/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:57:51.337222

H-1B $100K Fee Sparks Lawsuit and Industry Backlash

Supreme Court Allows Termination of TPS for Venezuelans

USCIS Launches Major Fraud Sweep in Minneapolis-St. Paul

Refugee Admissions Slashed to Record Low for FY2026

H-1B $100K Fee Sparks Lawsuit and Industry Backlash

A coalition of universities, healthcare providers, and nonprofits has sued the Trump administration over the new $100,000 H-1B application fee, calling it unlawful and economically damaging. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also objected, warning the policy would limit access to critical talent and force companies to outsource key functions.

The lawsuit argues the government bypassed required rulemaking and failed to consider the harm to organizations that rely on H-1B professionals, from schools and hospitals to tech and manufacturing firms. The Chamber urged the administration to withdraw the fee and instead pursue reforms that align visa policy with U.S. workforce needs.

Impact: If implemented, the $100K fee could reshape hiring strategies, spike program costs, and accelerate a shift toward alternative visa categories and green card sponsorships.

Supreme Court Allows Termination of TPS for Venezuelans

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan nationals, affecting hundreds of thousands of individuals currently residing and working in the U.S.

The decision stays a lower court order that had blocked termination while litigation continued. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, warning the ruling overlooks the irreparable harm to families and communities that have relied on TPS stability.

Impact: Employers with Venezuelan nationals under TPS should immediately review work authorization timelines and prepare contingency plans, including transitioning to alternative visa categories or permanent residence options to avoid workforce disruption.

USCIS Launches Major Fraud Sweep in Minneapolis-St. Paul

USCIS, ICE, and the FBI conducted “Operation Twin Shield,” a large-scale fraud detection initiative in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the agency’s first surge of this magnitude in a single region. Over 900 site visits and interviews were conducted, targeting 1,000+ cases with potential fraud or ineligibility indicators.

USCIS reported evidence of noncompliance or fraud in 275 cases, with 42 referrals to ICE and several arrests. Director Joseph Edlow warned this is “the first of many” such operations and advised other cities to prepare for similar enforcement activity.

Impact: Employers should expect heightened scrutiny of immigration filings nationwide, particularly around employment verification, site visit preparedness, and documentation accuracy. Now is the time to audit records, confirm public access files, and reinforce compliance training with HR and managers supporting foreign nationals.

Refugee Admissions Slashed to Record Low for FY2026

The Trump administration plans to cut U.S. refugee admissions to 7,500, down from 125,000 under the Biden administration and reportedly prioritize certain groups, including white Afrikaners from South Africa, citing claims of “unjust discrimination.”

This marks one of the lowest refugee ceilings in U.S. history and continues a broader rollback of humanitarian and asylum pathways.

The chief of the National Guard Bureau, which administers two organizations — the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard — was a job for a three-star general until recent years.
The Army National Guard and the Air National Guard have units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
As of Oct. 1, there were still nearly 2,200 Guard troops deployed in Washington, with more than 950 from the D.C. National Guard.
Late Sunday, a federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. Texas National Guard troops arrived in the Chicago area on Tuesday and were expected to deploy by Wednesday.","Instead, Democratic governors are accusing Republicans, especially Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, of a betrayal, even an “invasion” of their states.

“Greg Abbott is a tool of Donald Trump, he’s his lackey,” said Mr. Pritzker in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC this week.

Mr. Abbott returned fire, calling Mr. Pritzker “clueless.”

Such animus would once have been considered unusual or out of bounds for governors, who generally have seen themselves as pragmatic politicians, required to balance budgets and find solutions for their states, regardless of party. The governors have hosted “disagree better” road shows in between twice-annual meetings and White House galas marked by bonhomie.

But the deployment of about 200 troops from Texas to the Chicago area, and the threatened movement of Texas troops to Portland, Ore., have ruptured such comity.

“The president wants to call up National Guard troops in a way that we don’t believe is lawful,” Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon, a Democrat, said in an interview. “That should concern every governor, Republican or Democrat.”

Democratic governors pleaded with Mr. Abbott to rebuff the president’s troop request. The Texan in turn castigated his Democratic colleagues as weak on crime and illegal immigration.

For Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Abbott, the rift over Texas troops is only the latest in an ongoing and bitter public feud that has not been a model of respectful debate.

Beyond calling Mr. Pritzker clueless, Mr. Abbott said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, “If anybody is shot, if anybody is attacked, I tell you what, Governor Pritzker and the local mayor there in Chicago, they are accomplices to those crimes by stirring up this hate against I.C.E. agents.”

(Mr. Trump said Wednesday that Mr. Pritzker and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, “should be in jail.”)

Playing in the background is the 2028 presidential election, in which many of the big state governors — including Mr. Pritzker, Mr. Newsom and Mr. Abbott — see themselves as prime candidates to be their party’s nominee.

Mr. Abbott said as much about the Illinois and California governors during the Tuesday interview. “They’re hoping to be first in line when it comes to the Democrat nomination for the presidency,” he said. “But it doesn’t matter which one of them may be the winner of that nomination, because they are utter failures for our country.”

Mr. Abbott has previously denied that he himself has presidential aspirations, and a political consultant for the governor said that the Texas governor was focused on his re-election bid next year. But politics are always present: Mr. Abbott’s campaign sent an email on Wednesday soliciting support — and an email and phone number — for the deployment.

“While other states turn their backs on President Trump, elite members of the Texas National Guard are stepping in,” the email read.

Some bipartisanship still exists — with former governors. More than two dozen of them filed a motion on Wednesday afternoon requesting permission to enter a legal brief objecting to the Texas Guard mobilization in Illinois. Among the Republicans were William Weld of Massachusetts, Bill Graves of Kansas, Arne Carlson of Minnesota, Marc Racicot of Montana and Christie Whitman of New Jersey.

“The president’s assertion of authority to deploy military troops on domestic soil based on his unreviewable discretion, and without the cooperation and coordination of state authorities, threatens to upset the delicate balance of state and federal authority that underlies our constitutional order,” more than two dozen former governors wrote.

All of this has put severe strains on the National Governors Association, which since 1908 has sought to create a space for socializing and negotiations between Republican and Democratic states.

The association has so far been silent on the brewing clash between governors and the threats by Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Newsom to quit. Messages and emails to several representatives of the association were not returned.

Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas, the chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, called the National Guard deployments across state lines ordered by the president “a blatant abuse of power and an attack on state sovereignty.”

But the current chairman of the National Governors Association, Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, has not commented publicly. He has previously suggested that the role of the bipartisan association was not to make statements but to find areas of agreement between the two parties. (The Republican Governors Association has also not weighed in.)

“The N.G.A. is to bring people together, and I don’t think America wants people to take their ball and go home,” Mr. Stitt said last month, referring to the departure from the association of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, earlier this year. She cited a lack of bipartisanship as her reason for leaving the group.

Mr. Newsom suggested he would do the same if the association did not position itself against the interstate deployments over the objections of governors.

“If the National Governors Association cannot stand against states LITERALLY INVADING ONE ANOTHER — count me out,” he wrote on social media.

The California governor’s office later responded to a social media posting from Mr. Abbott — which suggested Democratic governors were mad at Mr. Trump for trying to do something about crime in their cities — with a litany of statistics about the high crime in Texas cities.

In recent years, the group has tried to show the country how to “disagree better,” putting out videos in which governors of different parties demonstrate to voters how to air political conflicts face-to-face, rather than to retreat to separate partisan corners. Instead, this week the disagreements got worse, after Mr. Abbott agreed to send his troops north.

The idea of “disagree better,” spearheaded by Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, when he was chair of the organization, was to have governors model productive debate for people around the county in order to try to turn down the political temperature and lessen the nation’s polarization.

The effort appeared to be effective, said Robb Willer, a Stanford University professor and adviser to the initiative who studied its impact. “We found that when we showed that to even far-left and far-right Democrats and Republicans, that they were impressed,” he said, ”and on average tended to view the governors more positively.”

Now, Dr. Willer said, by fighting aggressively in public, the governors may be worsening already-heightened political tension.

“Cues from party leaders are a major factor that influences Americans’ levels of toxic polarization,” he said.

A spokesman for Mr. Cox did not respond to a request for an interview with the governor.

Tension between Mr. Abbott and Mr. Pritzker has been growing over the last few years as each has found ways to insert himself into the affairs of the other’s state.

From 2022 to 2024, the Texas governor sent more than 36,000 migrants from the border to Chicago, part of his aggressive effort to target Democratic cities that had held themselves out as sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants.

Then this summer Mr. Pritzker welcomed dozens of Democratic lawmakers from Texas who left the state in order to thwart a Republican effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts, which was pushed by Mr. Trump and enthusiastically supported by Mr. Abbott. The two state leaders traded frequent barbs during the two weeks that the Texas Democrats were holed up in a hotel outside of Chicago.

The decision, issued on Tuesday, is confined to Chicago and will expire in February, but it could influence the courts’ interpretations of ICE’S legal authorities in similar cases elsewhere.

The 52-page ruling from Magistrate Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings challenges the legal basis for one of ICE’S tools for making arrests — blank warrants that are often filled out by officers in the field. Under Tuesday’s order, those forms can be used only as a basis to arrest someone who has already received a notice to appear before an immigration judge.

That change alone sharply limits ICE’S authority to make “collateral arrests” of unknown individuals who officers encounter in the field, unless the agents have probable cause to believe those people are likely to escape before a warrant can be issued.

“If ICE can’t arrest them without a warrant, that really limits the use of racial profiling,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which represented the plaintiffs.

Judge Cummings highlighted the importance of probable cause after a recent Supreme Court interim ruling that allowed immigration authorities to continue to stop people and question them based on factors like their ethnicity.

“Citizens, non-citizens with legal status, and foreign nationals are interwoven throughout ICE’S Chicago Area of Responsibility and American society in general,” Judge Cummings wrote. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, he wrote, U.S. citizens and legal residents could now be questioned or detained for sharing “commonalities” like ethnicity and language with “Latino foreign nationals.”

That, he said, heightens the need for ICE agents to show probable cause.

Mr. Fleming praised the decision. “We’re seeing more people who have deep community ties — families, loved ones, people with jobs, some of them U.S. citizens — being taken into ICE custody,” he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that the department “complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.”

The order focuses on the arrest of 22 individuals. Eleven of them were working at a restaurant in Liberty, Mo., when ICE took them into custody on Feb. 7, less than a month after Mr. Trump returned to office.

Judge Cummings found that ICE did not have reason to believe that the individuals were “reasonably likely” to escape before the agency could obtain a warrant, in violation of a consent agreement that the agency had entered into in 2022, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was still in office.

In the agreement, ICE denied the plaintiffs’ allegations and did not admit to any wrongdoing by its officers.

According to the plaintiffs, another 11 people were arrested in violation of the agreement in the Chicago area and were taken into custody by ICE.

Rather than extend the 2022 agreement for another three years, as the plaintiffs had asked, Judge Cummings extended it by 118 days. None of the 22 arrestees are still in custody, but the order requires ICE to “lift any imposed conditions” of their release. The court also required ICE to again send out a policy statement explaining the legal requirements to make an arrest to all ICE officers nationwide.

Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes dismissed the case against the two protesters, Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, on Wednesday morning after prosecutors said in a hearing that they had not secured an indictment.

Richard S. Kling, a lawyer who represented Mr. Collins, called the failure to secure an indictment “highly unusual.”

Grand jurors consider evidence presented by prosecutors and the witnesses they choose to present — not from the defense or the people accused — during secret proceedings. Unlike in a criminal trial, where juries must reach a unanimous verdict, only a simple majority of the grand jury is required to issue an indictment.

Mr. Kling cited the legal adage maintaining that the threshold for securing an indictment is so low that a grand jury would readily indict a ham sandwich. “Obviously, they didn’t have enough for a ham sandwich here,” he said.

Other grand juries have also bucked federal prosecutors seeking to crack down on those who have stood in the way of the government’s aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.

In August, a federal grand jury in Washington declined to indict a man who was facing felony assault charges for lobbing a sandwich that struck a federal agent. Days earlier, federal prosecutors in Washington downgraded charges against a woman accused of assaulting an F.B.I. agent during a protest after failing to persuade three grand juries to indict her on felony charges.

The latest case involved the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., a small suburb west of Chicago, which has been the site of protests since the Department of Homeland Security began focusing on the Chicago area about a month ago, in an operation it calls Midway Blitz.

Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo were among those protesting outside the facility on the evening of Sept. 27. According to the criminal complaint, Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo, who are engaged, were part of a group that scuffled with law enforcement officials as they sought to push protesters away from the building.

As agents sought to restrain Mr. Collins, “he resisted, struggling with agents,” which caused an injury to the thumb of a federal agent, according to the complaint. Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo were both armed during the scuffle, with weapons that they had permits for, according to prosecutors.

Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago, declined to say whether the office would present the case to a new grand jury.

Mr. Kling said he was heartened that grand jurors had reined in prosecutors in cases involving acts of protest.

“I’m gratified the grand jury stood up for the First Amendment in reaction to what is going on in the streets of this country,” he said.

Ms. Noem and other federal leaders have said the situation around the ICE building, where demonstrators typically stand or sit on the sidewalks and sometimes attempt to block cars from entering or leaving, must change.

“We want more security at the building, a bigger buffer zone to keep our officers safe,” she told Fox News Tuesday evening, adding that she didn’t want to “let the anarchists run this city anymore.”

Ms. Noem came to Portland with a list of demands, which were laid out in a letter the U.S. attorney for Oregon gave to Portland’s police chief on Tuesday. Among them: The federal government wants the city police to create a buffer zone of limited access around the building at least one block in radius, establish “free speech zones” to limit where demonstrators can gather, insure that federal agents can enter and leave the building without interference and prioritize responding to “any call for assistance based on threats to federal property or persons.”

Local elected officials acknowledged that their conversations with the secretary, held at Portland International Airport and at the ICE building, were direct and, at times, uncomfortable.

“I’m glad she had time for me,” Tina Kotek, Oregon’s governor, said in an interview. “I think it’s important that she’s here to see what is going on. And, hopefully, she’ll come away with the understanding that this is not an insurrection or a rebellion or whatever else the president is saying.”

Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland responded to Ms. Noem’s demands on Wednesday with a letter to her general counsel. He did not directly address her request for a larger buffer zone around the building or designated areas for protests, but did note that deciding how to handle political demonstrations was the responsibility of the city, not the federal government.

He also raised a point that was not in the U.S. attorney’s letter but came up in conversations between local and federal leaders: The city could take over the lease or outright buy the ICE building, and the processing ICE does there could be relocated.

“Given the operational challenges and expense this facility likely demands, we believe this may be a mutually beneficial solution in the best interests of all parties and stakeholders,” Mr. Wilson wrote.

The governor and mayor also said they also made their own requests: that federal agents abide by Oregon laws regarding how and when law enforcement can use force, including tear gas.

Ms. Noem told Fox News that she was dealing with “a bunch of pansies” in her talks with elected officials in Oregon and was “extremely disappointed” by her conversation with Mr. Wilson.

“I told him that if he did not follow through on some of these security measures for our officers,” she said, “we are going to cover him up with more federal resources and that we were going to send four times the amount of federal officers here so that the people of Portland can have some safety.”

The scene at the ICE building when Ms. Noem visited on Tuesday was calm. About a dozen demonstrators, including a woman in a bear costume and sombrero and a man in a chicken onesie, were outnumbered by journalists. The police had cordoned off a one-block area around the facility, so Ms. Noem’s only view of the protests came when she surveyed the scene from the roof of the building — alongside some federal employees and several conservative influencers — and when her motorcade entered and exited the building.

The Portland police continued to keep a one block radius around the building closed to the public on Wednesday morning, but a department spokesperson said the area would be reopened to the public later in the day. Overnight, the police removed a sidewalk camp that protesters had been using for several months.

A Federal District Court judge, Karin Immergut, has temporarily blocked President Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard soldiers to protect the ICE building. An appeal in that case is underway at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

Mr. Trump has activated the Guard several times this year in Democratic-led cities, in what he has called a crackdown on crime and as part of his escalating immigration enforcement tactics.

Here is an overview of what the National Guard typically does and how Mr. Trump is currently deploying the force in the United States.

What is the National Guard?

Tracing its history to the Massachusetts militia in 1636, the National Guard is a component of the U.S. military that has state and federal missions and traditionally operates under the jurisdiction of governors under Title 32 of the U.S. Code.

By comparison, the active-duty military operates under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, and the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act makes it a crime to use the regular military as a domestic police force in most circumstances.

Who is in charge of it?

The chief of the National Guard Bureau, which administers two organizations — the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard — was a job for a three-star general until recent years.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress elevated the job to a four-star position in 2008 and made the chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2011.

The current chief of the National Guard Bureau is Gen. Steven S. Nordhaus of the Air Force.

Operationally, the Guard troops currently being sent into U.S. cities are under the command of Gen. Gregory M. Guillot of U.S. Northern Command, a four-star general who takes his orders from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Where are Guard units located?

The Army National Guard and the Air National Guard have units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

How large is the force, and what does it do?

More than 430,000 soldiers and airmen serve in the National Guard and operate akin to a reserve component of the active-duty force, typically reporting for duty one weekend a month and two weeks a year.

Beyond those obligations, they can be mobilized on active duty for specific periods by a state or territorial governor for support operations such as responding to natural disasters or civil unrest.

The White House can mobilize Guard troops under Title 10 of the U.S. Code for national missions — including overseas deployment to serve in wars — over the objection of state and territorial governors. (The District of Columbia National Guard reports to the federal government, as the capital does not have a governor.)

The Guard also participates in training foreign allies and partners in more than 100 countries under the State Partnership Program, which evolved from a Cold War-era initiative to help former Soviet states operate their own military forces as newly democratic nations. Troops participating in the program often spend their two weeks of active federal service deployed to a partner nation, working with the same units to build relationships over repeat visits.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian military leaders often turned to their longtime partners in the California National Guard for assistance.

Has the federal government mobilized Guard troops for domestic missions before?

Yes.

The Guard has been federally mobilized at least 10 times since World War II, according to a recent Guard document.

Five of the mobilizations were in support of racial desegregation efforts and the protection of civil rights: at schools in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957-58; Oxford, Miss., in 1962; twice in Alabama in 1963, and again in 1965 to protect civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery. Until this year, the 1965 mobilization was the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without the cooperation of a governor.

Three federal Guard mobilizations were in response to riots: in Detroit in 1967; in multiple cities in 1968 after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; and in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers who had assaulted Rodney King, a Black motorist.

Another federal mobilization was in response to a strike by Postal Service workers in New York in 1970, and another was to restore order in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

Have domestic deployments gone badly before?

Yes.

In 1970, the mobilization of Guard soldiers by Gov. James A. Rhodes, Republican of Ohio, ended tragically when troops opened fire on students who were peacefully protesting the Vietnam War on the campus of Kent State University. The soldiers killed four students and wounded nine unarmed protesters, who were all in their late teens and early 20s.

Neither the governor nor any of the Guardsmen who shot students were found criminally liable for the shootings.

How many Guard troops are federally mobilized right now?

The exact number is unclear.

According to the National Guard Bureau, its troops can have dozens of federal missions at any given time to include “disaster relief, defense support of civilian authorities, training missions” and “community engagement.”

The bureau on Monday referred questions about the number of troops who are currently deployed on the order of the president to the Army component of U.S. Northern Command, which then referred questions to the defense secretary’s office.

The defense secretary’s press office on Tuesday referred those questions back to the Guard task force in Washington, D.C., and to a U.S. Northern Command website for what it calls the “federal protective mission” in the United States.

Here’s what we do know: In June, 2,000 members of the California National Guard were mobilized to Los Angeles to quell immigration protests. In July, Mr. Trump authorized the deployment of Guard troops to immigration facilities in 20 states.

In August, Mr. Trump federalized the local police in Washington and mobilized troops to fight crime, even though violent crime was falling in the city. Later that month, he directed the Defense Department to create a mobile Guard unit that could be sent anywhere in the country for “ensuring public safety and order.”

In September, the president signed an order authorizing the use of the National Guard in Memphis and said he would consider similar deployments in Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.

As of Oct. 1, there were still nearly 2,200 Guard troops deployed in Washington, with more than 950 from the D.C. National Guard. A majority of the troops patrolling the capital are normally based in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.

Late Sunday, a federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. Texas National Guard troops arrived in the Chicago area on Tuesday and were expected to deploy by Wednesday.

Do Guard troops on federal orders still get paid during the government shutdown?

The National Guard receives state and federal funding, but troops are paid by their state legislatures when mobilized by governors. Those on federal orders will not be paid until congressional funding is restored.

Arguments made by Mr. Trump’s Justice Department, she continued, “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Hours earlier, after a Friday hearing before Judge Immergut, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who is the architect of Mr. Trump’s push to deploy U.S. soldiers on their own soil, said the problem lay elsewhere. “Far-left Democrat judges,” he said, were obstructing the administration’s attempt to “dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

But Judge Immergut is anything but a far-left judge. When Mr. Trump first nominated her to the federal bench in 2018, she arrived with strong conservative credentials, and her career shows a willingness to pursue cases no matter which party’s ox is gored. As a lawyer during the 1990s, she served under Ken Starr during his investigation of President Bill Clinton.

She personally questioned Monica Lewinsky about the details of her affair with Mr. Clinton before a grand jury, successfully eliciting fine-grained specifics of their sexual encounters that critics would later call salacious when they appeared in Mr. Starr’s report.

During the next two decades, she built a career as a federal prosecutor, first in California and then in Oregon. She prosecuted white-collar fraudsters, money launderers and drug traffickers. In 2003, she was chosen by President George W. Bush to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, supervising dozens of prosecutors and overseeing high-profile terrorism cases.

As a prosecutor, Judge Immergut was “incredibly hard-working” and “apolitical in her approach,” said Billy J. Williams, who has known her since the 1990s and also went on to lead Oregon’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, first under President Obama and then continuing through Mr. Trump’s first term. “When she’s on the bench, she’s an incredible listener who isn’t afraid, in the moment, to either make a statement or ask deeper questions. She’s always prepared.”

Scott Asphaug, who also worked under Judge Immergut during her time as Oregon’s chief federal prosecutor, said she told her team to “do the right thing, for the right reason.”

“Our job was not simply to win,” he said. “Our job was to act in a judicious and just manner.”

In an emergency hearing on Sunday night, Judge Immergut clarified her restraining order, barring the administration from sending in National Guard troops from any other state. Having already ruled that President Trump lacked a legal basis for sending the military, she warned the administration could be “in direct contravention” of her order, citing reports that troops from Texas and California could soon be on their way.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she asked. “Why is this appropriate?”

Like Judge Immergut, Mr. Williams was working out of the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland in the summer of 2020. That was when Attorney General Bill Barr sent federal agents to Portland to deal with crowds who had gathered around the courthouse to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police.

Mr. Williams said that while parts of downtown Portland did resemble a “war zone” back in 2020, the circumstances of the current protests, which are smaller in scale and concentrated around an ICE building in South Portland, were “vastly different.”

“I don’t fault ICE for doing their work,” he said. “I believe in law and order. And people get to protest it, so long as that’s done in a lawful manner. It’s a careful balance.”

Judge Immergut’s ruling, he said, “was based on the facts of 2025, not 2020; what’s happening now is nothing like what happened then.”

The judge has not yet made a final ruling on the merits of the case. Her temporary restraining order will expire later this month, and a trial is scheduled in Portland for the morning of October 29.

The Trump administration has appealed Judge Immergut’s initial ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And on social media, Mr. Miller is not letting Judge Immergut’s conservative background interfere with his attacks on the legitimacy of her rulings. Her order, he wrote, amounted to an attempt to “nullify the 2024 election by fiat.” On Monday, he called her a “district court judge with no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President,” and an “Oregon judge.”

On Sunday, Mr. Trump addressed his selection of Judge Immergut more directly, telling reporters that “if they put judges like that on, I wasn’t well-served by the people who picked judges.”

But while he seemed to be cognizant of the fact that one of his nominees had ruled against him, his awareness did not extend to that judge’s gender. Mr. Trump repeatedly referred to Judge Immergut as “he” and “him.”

“That judge ought to be ashamed of himself,” he said.

Essential federal employees, including military personnel and ICE agents, must continue to work without pay during the shutdown.

While workers are entitled to back pay after the shutdown ends, President Trump has suggested some furloughed employees may not ""deserve"" it.

One week into the government shutdown and the country has already seen significant impacts on federal agencies. So far, there have been over 750,000 furloughed workers, air travel delays due to an air traffic controller shortage and reduced services at Social Security offices.

Now, military service members may not get paid.

As the ongoing stalemate in Congress lingers, paychecks for military service members and civilian contractors are on the line. Payments set to be issued on Oct. 15 may not be sent out if lawmakers don't reach an agreement. Legislation would have to be passed by Oct. 13 (Columbus Day) to process payments for troops to be paid on time, according to Reuters.

More than 1 million active-duty military, as well as hundreds of thousands of active National Guard members and civilians who work for the Department of Defense (DOD), would be affected. Military personnel still have to work during a government shutdown.

Here's who will and won't get paid during the shutdown.

What happens if military members don't receive Oct. 15 paychecks?

Service members must continue to work during a government shutdown, but that doesn't mean they will get paid during that time.

In many cases, payment is delayed until after the shutdown ends, but service members are entitled to back pay, a move signed into law by President Trump in 2019 to compensate active-duty military members and furloughed employees for back pay once the government reopens. While troops did get paid on Oct. 1, future missed payments may present financial hardships to military families.

However, Trump has since said this week that some furloughed federal workers “don’t deserve” back pay and has threatened mass layoffs and widespread cuts to government programs, USA TODAY reports.

Does ICE get paid during the government shutdown?

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which operates under the Department of Homeland Security, will also continue working since it is deemed ""essential"" to government operations.

Like DOD military members, ICE agents do not receive paychecks during the shutdown but are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.

Will the National Guard get paid during the government shutdown?

Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists are expected to remain on duty without pay, Indianapolis Star reports, but will receive back pay after the shutdown.

Who continues working, getting paid in a government shutdown?

Essential workers are still on the clock. They must continue working without pay, and they typically aren't eligible to collect unemployment benefits. Here's who continues working, per the Indianapolis Star:

Active-duty military: Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists remain on duty without pay.

Air travel: Transportation Security Administration agents at airports and air-traffic controllers are required to work without pay.

Border Patrol and ICE: Border Patrol officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and customs officials will keep working without pay.

Federal law enforcement: The FBI, CIA, DEA and Secret Service stay on the job without pay.

IRS: Employees at the IRS worked during the first five days of the shutdown, according to a contingency plan the agency posted Sept. 30, by tapping into funds already authorized by Congress.

Mail: The U.S. Postal Service remains open. It doesn't depend on Congress for funding, so postal employees will still get paid throughout the government shutdown.

Prisons: Correctional officers at U.S. prisons keep working without pay.

""Non-essential"" staff at national parks, NASA, the Department of Education and other government positions may either be furloughed or laid off in staffing cuts during the government shutdown.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/USAT/86580929007-20251008-t-011023-z-278100572-rc-277-hamejkt-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-08 18:56:41.516676

In a letter written to Congress on Wednesday, the signatories condemned a series of recent US strikes on boats in the Caribbean, including at least three originating from Venezuela, that have killed more than 20 people since September. The strikes are the first lethal US military operations in the Caribbean in decades, part of what the Trump administration calls a fight against “narcoterrorism”.

“The Trump administration has not provided any valid legal justification for these strikes or any evidence to substantiate its claims that the victims were an imminent threat to the security of the United States,” the letter said.

Signed by nearly 60 organisations – including Oxfam America, Human Rights First, Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns and the American Friends Service Committee – the letter called on members of Congress to block what it described as unauthorised and illegal uses of force.

“We fear, barring decisive action by members of Congress, there will be more strikes, more extrajudicial killings, and potentially a full-blown limitless war with one or more countries in the region, with likely devastating humanitarian and geopolitical consequences,” the letter said.

The appeal was issued before a War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Adam Schiff was expected to reach the Senate floor on Wednesday. Schiff said he and Kaine will force a vote to block the government from carrying out lethal strikes against vessels in the Caribbean.

“If a president can unilaterally put people or groups on a list and kill them, there is no meaningful limit to his use of force,” Schiff said.

The measure seeks to halt unauthorised US military activity in the Caribbean and reassert Congress’s authority over the use of force.

Escalation and legal concerns

The New York Times reported in July that Trump signed a secret directive authorising the possibility of “direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil against cartels”.

Within weeks, US Navy warships and aircraft and more than 4,000 soldiers were deployed to the southern Caribbean. Two weeks later, the first of four strikes occurred.

To justify the escalation, the administration labelled certain regional groups like Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as “foreign terrorist organisations” and “specially designated global terrorists”. However, legal experts noted these designations do not authorise the use of military force overseas.

Administration officials have defended the escalation as a counternarcotics mission, insisting that the targeted vessels were linked to drug trafficking and “terrorist organisations”.

But according to the Washington Office on Latin America and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, about 90 percent of US-bound cocaine transits the eastern Pacific and western Caribbean, not near Venezuela’s coast. The Drug Enforcement Agency likewise reported that fentanyl entering the US is produced in Mexico using precursor chemicals from China, not Venezuela.

At the Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia this week, Trump told reporters that if traffickers “aren’t coming by sea any more”, US forces might “move the fight onto land”.

Regime change fears

As the administration’s rhetoric has increasingly blurred the line between targeting drug traffickers and targeting the Venezuelan state itself, civil society groups are arguing that the strikes are part of a broader strategy aimed at regime change in Venezuela. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has long advocated for regime change there, has referred to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government as a cartel “masquerading as a government” and branded him a fugitive from US justice, offering up to a $50m reward for his capture.

However, internal documents obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation confirmed that US intelligence agencies acknowledged Maduro’s government is “not directing [Venezuela’s] Tren de Aragua’s operations in the United States”.

Alex Main, director of international policy of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, warned that Trump’s campaign “could soon be directed at Venezuela in an attempt to incite violent regime change” and other countries, such as Mexico or Panama, could also face US intervention with “potentially disastrous consequences” for the region.

Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives have also stated that “Trump and Rubio are pushing for regime change in Venezuela,” adding: “The American people don’t want another war – and Congress can’t let any president start one illegally or unilaterally. That’s not how the Constitution works.”

Elizabeth Tregaskis Gordon, senior policy advisor for LAC at Oxfam America, told Al Jazeera that many Venezuelans are already “living through crisis” and warned that an increase in US military would disrupt humanitarian work in the country.

“Many cannot access basic necessities to survive, while they face rising prices for consumer goods and increasing food insecurity,” she said. “Worsening of the humanitarian crisis will only lead to more chaos and disruption; current US military action is unconstitutional, violates the UN charter, and should cease immediately. ”

Faith communities take a stand

“War is always a defeat,” Susan Gunn, director of the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, told Al Jazeera. “When such killing is aimed at civilians with no due process, it violates the sacredness of human life and undermines basic human rights and the rule of law.”

The letter her group and others wrote to Congress also warns that further escalation could worsen Latin America’s largest modern displacement crisis, deepening the suffering of millions of people who have already fled Venezuela.

The signatories urged Congress to reverse the military build-up, investigate civilian deaths and pursue diplomacy.

The Friends Committee on National Legislation’s general secretary, Bridget Moix, added: “War is not the answer at home or abroad.”

“In these unprecedented times,” the letter concluded, “it is critical that the US Congress reclaim its constitutional powers.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68e6a230-1759945264.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-08 18:56:38.084655

Chicago, the largest city in Illinois and third-largest in the country, has become the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration’s drive to deport millions of immigrants, which has prompted allegations of rights abuses and myriad lawsuits.

The operation is being led by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose masked agents have surged into several Democratic-led cities to conduct raids, stoking outrage among many residents and protests outside federal facilities.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump posted Wednesday on his Truth Social platform.

Local officials argue that city and state law enforcement are sufficient to handle the protests, but Trump claims the military is needed to keep federal agents safe, heightening concerns among his critics of growing authoritarianism.

After National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, 200 troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday.

An immigration enforcement building outside Chicago has also been the site of clashes between federal agents and protesters.

“The federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,” Pritzker told reporters in Chicago. “I can’t believe I have to say ‘troop movements’ in an American city, but that is what we’re talking about here.”

A judge will have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: There’s a court hearing Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the National Guard deployment illegal.

‘Stand up and speak out’

Trump’s attacks on Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, follow similar extraordinary public calls by the president for his political opponents to face legal charges.

They come on the same day that former FBI director James Comey was arraigned on charges of lying to Congress – an indictment which came just days after Trump urged his attorney general to take action against him and others.

Pritzker, seen as a potential Democratic candidate in the 2028 presidential election, has become one of Trump’s most fiery critics.

He pledged Wednesday to “not back down,” listing a litany of grievances against Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“Making people feel they need to carry citizenship papers. Invading our state with military troops. Sending in war helicopters in the middle of the night,” he wrote on X.

“What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?” he asked. “We must all stand up and speak out.”

By “war helicopters”, Pritzker was referring to a major raid last week in which Black Hawk helicopters descended on a Chicago housing complex.

Dozens of people were arrested in the surprise operation, according to the Trump administration, but US media reported that American citizens were detained for hours.

Mayor Johnson has since announced “ICE-free zones” where city-owned property will be declared off-limits to federal authorities.

Johnson accused Republicans of wanting “a rematch of the Civil War”.

Trump’s immigration crackdown is aimed at fulfilling a key election pledge to rid the country of what he called waves of foreign “criminals”.

Trump has nonetheless faced some legal setbacks, including a federal judge in Oregon blocking his bid to deploy troops in Portland, saying his descriptions of an emergency there were false and that the US is a “nation of Constitutional law, not martial law”.

Trump says he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to force deployments of troops around the country if courts or local officials are “holding us up”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280665815461-1759868765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-08 17:57:58.107312

Lawmakers said Graphite can gain unauthorized access to mobile phone encrypted applications, location data, messages, and photographs.

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote.

Lawmakers noted that while Paragon claims it has safeguards in place to protect against civil liberty and privacy violations, it comes with the ability for “zero-click” access to messaging apps and has been used to spy on journalists and human rights activists.

Allowing ICE officers to use this spyware could threaten Americans’ freedom of speech and movement, lawmakers warned.

“Allowing ICE to utilize spyware raises serious questions about whether ICE will respect Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure for people residing in the U.S.,” stated the letter.

The representatives gave Noem until Oct. 20 to provide details on all ICE records on its use of spyware, including Paragon’s Graphite tool, internal legal justifications for deploying such technology in immigration enforcement, and a list of surveillance targets and ICE’s domestic spying strategy.

They also asked whether the Department of Homeland Security had evaluated how the use of Graphite may violate an executive order that prohibits the operational use of commercial spyware that may pose counterintelligence or security risks to the federal government.

About 200 members from multiple units in the Texas National Guard and 300 members from units in the Illinois National Guard have been activated and sent to the Chicago area, the statement said. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has denounced the deployment as an unconstitutional invasion.

The troops are stationed at the Army Reserve center in Elwood, outside Joliet, about an hour southwest of Chicago.

“These forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,” U.S. Northern Command said in its statement.

On Monday, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago sued to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.

In a statement Sunday, ahead of the National Guard’s arrival, Pritzker said, “We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion.”

“It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops,” he said.

​“The brave men and women who serve in our national guards must not be used as political props,” he said. “This is a moment where every American must speak up and help stop this madness.”

President Donald Trump said Wednesday on Truth Social that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “should be in jail” in an escalation of his conflict with the two Democratic officials.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” he said in the post. “Governor Pritzker also!”

Trump has threatened for weeks to send troops to Chicago as part of a crime-fighting and immigration effort, and Democrats have pushed back and said any deployment would be politically motivated against his perceived enemies and an overreach of authority.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

Pritzker responded to Trump on X, saying, “I will not back down.”

“Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power,” he said. “What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”

Reached for comment, Johnson said, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” he added.

The Trump administration is also seeking to send the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, but a judge granted a temporary restraining order over the weekend to block the move as the case is considered in court.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted an administrative stay of Judge Karin Immergut’s ruling Saturday and will allow for the federalization of Oregon National Guard members. The ruling did not address the deployment of those members in Portland, which is expected to be addressed at a hearing Thursday.

The emergency administrative ruling stands, while the appeals process in the case continues.

A Pentagon spokesperson said the troops would have worked to support ICE and other federal personnel, as well as protect federal property.

On Tuesday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek directed U.S. Northern Command to demobilize Oregon’s 200 National Guard troops and return another 200 California National Guard members to their state.

Referring to the judge’s decision temporarily blocking Trump from sending the National Guard into Portland, Kotek said in a statement, “Immergut’s orders are a clear and forceful rebuttal to President Trump’s misuse of states’ National Guard.”

“Thus, I am directing Northern Command to send Oregon’s citizen-soldiers home from Camp Rilea immediately,” she said. “Let’s remember that these Oregonians are our neighbors and friends, who have been unlawfully uprooted from their family and careers — they deserve better than this.”

It was unclear whether Kotek’s letter to U.S. Northern Command would have any effect. The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment about legal standing for directing Northern Command to send troops home. Northern Command also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to block Immergut’s order while the case makes its way through the courts, arguing her ruling “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.” Attorneys for the state contend her order should stay in place. The 9th Circuit court is scheduled to hear both sides’ arguments at a hearing Thursday.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251008-national-guard-gk-914415.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:58:16.022377

With the help of the Portland Fire Bureau, K9 units and officers boarded a fire boat and were taken to the island. Police say the suspect was arrested just after 1:30 a.m. Name and charges will be released later.

Since Trump returned to office in January, federal immigration officers have conducted sweeping raids in communities across the country. According to the latest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, the agency has removed more than 71,405 people this year.

The operations have sparked widespread protests and fears from migrant communities and their supporters. The crackdown has also been met with various legal challenges.

Mark Seitz, the bishop of El Paso, Texas, told Reuters that the pope is “very personally concerned about these matters” and “expressed his desire that the U.S. Bishops’ Conference would speak strongly on this issue.”

The Hill has reached out to the Vatican to confirm the pope’s remarks. The White House referred The Hill to press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s response disputing Leo’s stance from last week.

Last month, Leo said that those who are against abortion but in support of the “inhuman treatment of immigrants” in the U.S. are not “pro-life.”

“Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion’ but says, ‘I’m in favor of the death penalty,’ is not really pro-life,” the pope told reporters, via EWTN News. “Someone who says that, ‘I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”

On Tuesday, the Vatican announced that the pope will make the first international trip of his papacy to Turkey and Lebanon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 2.

“Lawful permanent residence was always considered secure — almost unassailable,” Nia said. “To see people who have lived and worked here for years suddenly detained or deported with little to no process is alarming. ICE appears to be acting unlawfully in many of these cases, without proper judicial oversight.""

US media reported this week that two Iranian green card holders were arrested in recent months by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in cases apparently involving minor crimes.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has stepped up efforts to detain and deport some green card holders citing past crimes or political activity at odds with its values. Most of the cases are being contested in courts.

Under US immigration law, green-card holders can only be deported in limited circumstances, such as when they commit certain crimes, falsify immigration documents, or remain outside the country for extended periods.

Nia said what is happening now goes far exceeds those bounds.

“Deporting Iranians who fled repression — or sending them to third countries like Sudan or Somalia — violates both international law and America’s own treaty obligations,” she said.

“This normalization of lawlessness should concern every American.”

In Los Angeles, NBC News reported that Sharareh Moghaddam, a small-business owner who had already passed her citizenship exam, was detained after attending what she thought was a routine immigration appointment. Her husband, Hooshang Aghdassi, said she had entered the country legally and had no record of wrongdoing.

“She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,” Aghdassi told NBC. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.”

ICE rejected that account, telling NBC Los Angeles in a written statement that reports claiming Moghaddam had no criminal history were “completely FALSE.” The agency described her as “an Iranian native and citizen with a documented criminal history dating back to 2015,” citing two theft convictions between 2015 and 2019, and concluded that she was “subject to removal under US immigration law.”

Newseek reported last month Reza Zavvar, a 52-year-old green card holder in Maryland who has lived in the United States for four decades, was detained for seventy-seven days by ICE in a case related to a marijuana charge in the nineties.

Zavvar, who first came to the country as a child, described his treatment as “unnecessary, inhumane, corrupt.”

“Saying that you can stay here as long as you don’t get in trouble, that you stay clean and just stay here, work, pay taxes — and that’s what I was doing,” Zavvar told the news outlet.

Iranians sent back from US without consent, lawyer says

More recently, 120 Iranians — including political dissidents and Christian converts — were deported to Tehran.

This comes after The New York Times reported that the operation followed “months of negotiations” between Washington and Iranian officials, and that the deportees were flown aboard US-chartered aircraft that left from a military airport in Louisiana, stopped in Puerto Rico to collect more passengers, and continued to Doha before their transfer to Iran.

Immigration attorney Ali Herischi, of Herischi & Associates in Maryland, told Iran International that two of his clients were among those deported against their will. “Their belongings — including their files, evidence and cell phones — have been handed to Iranian authorities. That’s very dangerous,” Herischi said.

Deported in shackles: Iranians sent back from US without consent, lawyer says

He added that some detainees were given a stark choice: “ICE would say, ‘either you consent to deportation to Iran, or we send you to Somalia or Sudan.’ It was, ‘pick your poison.’ In the case of my clients, they didn’t even get that. They just said, ‘you’re done, let’s go.’”

Another Iranian national, Erfan Qaneifard, a political activist and writer, has been held for six months at the Prairieland Detention Center in Texas.

His lawyer, Masoud Peyma, told Iran International that ICE contacted Iran’s Interests Section in Washington seeking travel papers to deport him. “The risk is real. If he is sent back, his life will be in danger,” Peyma said. “There is no reason for him to remain in detention after six months.”

Iranian political activist held in Texas faces risk of deportation, lawyer says

For Nia, these cases expose a broader collapse of process and accountability within the immigration system.

“It’s the normalization of a lack of process — the idea that even a green card, or eventually citizenship, could become conditional on political speech,” she said. “That’s authoritarianism creeping into the system.”

Civil-rights groups echoed those concerns, warning that forced returns could endanger vulnerable Iranians.

“Asylum seekers now face the possibility of being returned to a country where they have a well-founded fear of persecution,” the Iranian American Legal Defense Fund, Pars Equality Center, and the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans said in a joint statement.

“This runs against core American values as a nation based on hope, freedom, and liberty that has long welcomed people facing oppression who, in turn, have contributed mightily to America,"" the statement read.

DHS agents in masks have been told to “go out on the streets” and detain random people to see whether they are here illegally.
Humane immigration policy, focused on public safety threats, would also increase public support for ICE operations, reducing hostility in the community.","This weekend, Immigration and Customs Enforcement accused me — a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute — of causing assaults on its agents. I’m just the latest in a long line of people — mayors, governors, members of Congress and more — whom ICE has blamed for a rise in violent confrontations with their deportation agents.

In fact, ICE is endangering its own agents. According to the Trump administration, ICE agents suffered about 90% fewer assaults under President Joe Biden than under President Donald Trump. Biden’s ICE better protected agents by adopting interior enforcement policies that reduced chaotic interactions with the public.

This weekend, ICE accused me — a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute — of causing assaults on its agents.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is doing the opposite, demanding agents conduct operations in ways they’ve rarely done before. According to my analysis of ICE records, ICE is arresting 1,100% more people on the streets — that is, outside of jails, prisons or police custody — than it did even in 2017 during the first Trump administration. Most of these people have no criminal records.

This nearly matches DHS’ claimed 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE agents this year over last year. DHS agents in masks have been told to “go out on the streets” and detain random people to see whether they are here illegally.

The result is chaos. DHS’ targets don’t know why they’re being approached or what their rights are. Agents don’t know what to expect, either, putting them on edge. Onlookers often believe they are watching masked men abducting their friends and attempt to intervene.

Here’s an example: A U.S. citizen from California named Andrea Velez was on her way to work when an ICE agent ran her over. The agent reported he was chasing someone else because that person didn’t want to talk to him. ICE accused Velez of deliberately stepping in the agent’s way and charged her with assault, but the case was dismissed.

Another U.S. citizen watching Velez get picked up and carried away for seemingly no reason attempted to block ICE from driving away with her. An agent pepper-sprayed him inches away from his eyes, and the man swiped back, knocking off the agent’s baseball hat. He, too, was arrested and charged with assault.

So we ended up with two purported assaults on ICE, both stemming from the decision to “go out on the streets” and grab random people. These interactions never would have happened under Biden because his administration prohibited racial profiling in immigration enforcement and focused enforcement on public safety threats who were usually already secured behind bars.

When Biden’s ICE did target someone on the streets, it was a carefully planned operation with numerous agents working as a team to catch a specific public safety threat — not random, unplanned encounters with unknown people. This intentionally focused on officer safety. ICE has overturned this policy so that it can maximize arrests and meet a 3,000-per-day arrest target set by the White House.

Which brings us to the incident that led ICE to blame me for assaults. In that case, two agents working alone pulled over a Hispanic driver after he dropped off his two young U.S. citizen children at school. ICE officers receive little training in traffic stops, and these two failed to ensure he had turned off his car and removed his keys — a common police practice — before they reached inside.

The result is chaos. DHS’ targets don’t know why they’re being approached or what their rights are.

The driver appears to have panicked when he realized the officers were ICE and started to back up. Video shows that rather than step away from the moving car, one ICE agent pulled a gun, while the other held on to the moving car with his hands. When the driver didn’t stop, the agent who initially held on to the car shot and killed him. Though the seconds just before the shooting were off camera, DHS says the agent was “dragged.”

In its X post, ICE claimed I caused assaults on its officers by spreading “misinformation” about the case. That misinformation? An NBC News report that showed ICE lied about some facts. ICE called the man a “criminal,” but he had no criminal record, just years-old traffic citations. ICE said the officer was “severely injured,” but the officer reported that he had only a few scrapes. “Nothing major,” he said.

But these discrepancies aren’t the most important point: This incident and injury to an ICE agent most likely wouldn’t have happened at all before Trump for several reasons.

First, ICE wouldn’t have targeted a noncriminal living here for decades. Second, it wouldn’t have sent two agents alone. Third, they wouldn’t have gone without a clear plan to arrest him safely.

Fourth, while we can’t know what motivated his attempted flight, many people are now well aware of the inhumanities that befall immigrants in Trump administration ICE custody — everything from months in horrific ICE detention centers away from their families to deportations to random authoritarian countries or even straight to foreign prisons.

By treating immigrants more humanely, Biden took away a reason to flee agents or potentially engage in physical confrontations. Humane immigration policy, focused on public safety threats, would also increase public support for ICE operations, reducing hostility in the community.

Contrary to ICE’s implication, I don’t want ICE officers to be harmed. Indeed, I am more interested in ICE officer safety than ICE itself is.

ICE cares more about running up the deportation numbers than protecting its officers. If ICE returned to Biden’s interior enforcement policies, officers, Americans and immigrants would all be safer.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251005-chicago-ice-vl-502p-c80f2d.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:57:28.986266

One order is specifically aimed at preparing for the possibility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ramps up activity in the Emerald City.

Among multiple other steps to be taken by city departments, Harrell said he has directed the city council to come up with an ordinance that bans law enforcement from wearing face masks, except in limited situations. Agents would also be required to display visible emblems and badges that identify their agency.

“We have all seen photos and videos of masked ICE agents literally kidnapping people from neighborhoods, from our streets and sidewalks with impunity,” Harrell said. “Masked agents operating without clear identification diminish transparency, they erode accountability, and they sow fear in our communities. They are waging a campaign based on fear, and also creating a dangerous possibility for other bad actors.”

When asked how he would enforce this, Harrell suggested that it is the Seattle Police Department’s responsibility to carry out city ordinances, but clarified that specific enforcement structures are to be worked out in the weeks to come. The Seattle Police Department will be trained on how they are to respond should they receive a 911 report that masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people within the city.

Should the ordinance pass, Seattle will become the first major city to enact such a ban. The state of California passed a law in September that bars local and federal law enforcement from concealing their faces with masks.

Harrell plans to propose another piece of legislation that would ban federal immigration employees from staging in city parking lots, or conducting their operations on city property.

Preparing for a potential National Guard deployment

Harrell signed a second executive order Wednesday morning that outlines how the city and its departments will respond if Trump deploys that National Guard to Seattle.

Trump has attempted to deploy the guard to Chicago and Portland, two other sanctuary cities that have pushed back on ICE. Harrell said he has no knowledge of concrete plans by the Trump administration to send the National Guard to Seattle, but it’s being treated as a real possibility.

The order Harrell signed directs the city to proactively evaluate and prepare all legal options to challenge a National Guard deployment in court, and resist any encroachments on the roles and jurisdictions of the Seattle Police Department.

It seems as if the city is also proactively planning to referee between protestors and federal agents, should the National Guard be deployed. Harrell said the city “reaffirms its unwavering support for first amendment activities (and) protests,” but that officials will work directly with organizers in efforts to minimize the potential for conflicts.

""We want people to use their voice, that is part of our power, but we also don’t want to, as some would say, take the bait,” Harrell said Wednesday. “We don't want to see anyone in harm's way when we can't predict the abusive actions taken by our federal government.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/c9107680-6a0b-4576-a23d-2afce5fd20ff/20251008T194749/c9107680-6a0b-4576-a23d-2afce5fd20ff_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 16:58:39.830724

Now, as President Donald Trump agitates against Chicago in his Republican administration’s targeting of Democratic-run cities and states, federal grand jurors in Illinois have declined to approve charges against two people who were accused of assaulting agents in the Chicago area.

That led federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois to move to dismiss the charges Wednesday. Immigration officials had touted the arrests in the case last month, writing on social media that the defendants “will be prosecuted and held accountable.”

The first Executive Order protects local communities and control over law enforcement resources in the event that federalized National Guard troops are deployed to Seattle. The second Executive Order strengthens services to immigrant and refugee communities and proposes legislation to prohibit the practice of masked, non-uniformed federal agents conducting immigration enforcement raids within the City, as well as an ordinance to prevent federal law enforcement from staging on or conducting immigration enforcement operations on City property.

“We are in a truly unprecedented time in modern history where the president is talking about using American cities as ‘training grounds’ for the military – a disturbing statement that shows his disrespect for the law and disregard for the collaboration it takes between all levels of government to ensure our country thrives,” said Mayor Harrell. “As I said last week in partnership with Governor Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown, we do not need federal troops in Seattle, and this dangerous strategy will only sow fear, distrust, and confusion in our communities. We cannot be under-prepared at this critical moment when President Trump is escalating his attacks on cities and carrying out his cruel deportation agenda on our immigrant and refugee neighbors with warrantless arrests by masked, un-identifiable officers. These Executive Orders are proactive steps we can take to protect our communities and values.”

Together, the Executive Orders will:

Coordinate legal and intergovernmental actions:

Proactively evaluate and prepare all available legal options, ensuring readiness in the event of unlawful troop deployment.

Establish coordination citywide if federalized troops are deployed, creating a task force so there is a clear process and communication in place.

Ensure clear lines of communication and coordination with the Governor, Attorney General’s Office, City Attorney’s Office, and community.

Increase transparency around immigration enforcement:

Develop an ordinance to ban the use of face masks by law enforcement, with limited exceptions, in the City of Seattle and require law enforcement officials to have visible emblems and badges that identify their agency.

Develop an ordinance that prohibits federal law enforcement from staging on or conducting immigration enforcement operations on City property.

Provide the Seattle Police Department clear guidance on how to respond to 911 calls where masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people in the City.

Maintain local control and accountability of the Seattle Police Department (SPD):

Strengthen policies preventing unconstitutional and unlawful encroachment on the roles, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of SPD by the federal government.

Reaffirm that SPD has no role in federal civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Protect First Amendment activities:

Reaffirm the City’s unwavering support for First Amendment activities, and in the event of unilateral troop deployment, directs the City to work with organizers to keep protests peaceful and minimize the potential for conflict.

So far this year, President Trump has deployed and threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Memphis, and Portland. Last month, a federal judge ruled that President Trump’s use of military troops in Los Angeles was illegal. Last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the state’s National Guard in Portland, finding no legal basis for deployment. The Trump administration attempted to circumvent the order by sending California National Guard to the city, which the judge also blocked over the weekend.

President Trump has justified his deployment of troops in American cities to address crime and restore safety. In Seattle, SPD data shows that violent crime, property crime, and shots fired incidents are down compared to last year, and homicides are down 41% compared to 2024. Additionally, SPD is making record-breaking progress to restore police staffing, with nearly 130 officers hired so far this year.

“True public safety is not something that can be achieved by parachuting federal troops into Seattle. Policing is a profession that demands training, accountability, and a deep understanding of our communities,” said Police Chief Shon Barnes. “Decisions about Seattle’s safety should be based on facts and community feedback — not political talking points from people who do not live here and have no stake in our neighborhoods. The Seattle Police Department remains committed to evidence-based policing and building trust and real partnerships with our diverse communities.”

The City has advanced multiple legal and legislative steps to protect residents from the Trump administration’s unlawful actions and funding cuts, including legislation to strengthens local protections for people seeking gender-affirming and reproductive health care; a lawsuit over DEI and gender ideology Executive Orders and unlawful conditioning of funds; a lawsuit challenging threats to cities with sanctuary policies; and a lawsuit over frozen counterterrorism funds through the Securing the Cities program.

The Mayor’s 2026 proposed budget also includes a $27.6 million investment plan to safeguard essential services threatened by federal funding cuts, including shelter, rental assistance, and food access programs, and a 70% increase in funding for immigrant and refugee services including legal supports, Know Your Rights trainings, and workforce development.

As part of the Executive Order, the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) is launching a One Seattle Community Resource Fair series for community members and service providers. The events will connect residents with City services and resources from local community-based organizations. The first resource fair was Monday, October 6 and similar resource fairs are planned for the coming months.

“The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will devote resources and expertise to our close coordination with the Mayor’s office and other City departments, as outlined in both executive orders. A connected, fearless approach is what is needed right now to provide trust and safety during any potential deployment of the national guard, an encroachment purely meant to disrupt local control and threaten immigrant and refugee residents,” said OIRA Director Hamdi Mohamed. “Seattle’s immigrant residents are best served when they are empowered and informed about their rights, not targeted and misrepresented. The One Seattle approach outlined in these executive orders, along with coordination between state partners and community organizations, echoes loud and clear that Seattle will remain a Welcoming City.”

Additionally, OIRA will re-launch the Immigrant and Refugee Commission, following a brief hiatus earlier this year and is actively recruiting new members. The Commission advises the Mayor and City Council on issues directly impacting immigrants and refugees living and working in Seattle and supports advocacy and outreach efforts citywide.

What People Are Saying

King County Executive Shannon Braddock

“As public officials, transparency and trust are fundamental to our work, and we must stand by our values and stand up for the law. King County has continually pushed back against the Trump administration’s continued disregard for these principles and its unlawful actions, which only undermine public confidence in government. We stand united with our local and state leaders against this federal overreach in our community.”

Martiza Rivera, Seattle City Councilmember, District 4

“We must stand united in denouncing President Trump’s irrational and authoritarian actions. It is deeply disturbing and wrong that we are in this position – needing to prepare for an unwarranted deployment of Federal troops to our city. Unfortunately, it is essential that we do and do so as One Seattle. I support Mayor Harrell’s EO’s and am at the ready to work with him to protect ALL of our City’s residents.”

Dan Strauss, Seattle City Councilmember, District 6

“The president’s actions in Portland are not just unacceptable, they are unlawful. That’s not just me saying that. It was the ruling of a judge that he, himself appointed. Today’s executive order demonstrates another way we continue to harden our local government to withstand any threat from the Trump administration.”

Bob Kettle, Seattle City Councilmember, District 7

“There is simply no reason for the National Guard to be deployed in our city. We are on the job. As Chair of our Public Safety Committee, we have developed and implemented our Strategic Framework Plan, with nearly 30 pieces of legislation out of council, to help create a safer Seattle. Further, our military defends OUR nation. If it is seen as defending a partisan effort, then that vital concept is undercut with negative consequences long-term. We must continue to push back on such actions and rhetoric – we cannot normalize them.”

Sara Nelson, Seattle City Council President, Position 9 (At-Large)

“Seattle is prepared and ready to respond. If National Guard troops are ordered to Seattle, we will do all we can to prevent unmasked federal agents from intimidating our residents and we’re prepared to use all legal options to protect their rights and safety. We’re in close communication with the Governor, Attorney General’s Office, and City Attorney’s Office and we will support our Seattle Police Department in their mission – to protect and serve every person in our Seattle community – not to participate in the scare tactics of our federal government in uninvited immigration enforcement.”

Vanessa Reyes, Policy Manager, Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network (WAISN)

“As the largest statewide network for immigrant justice in Washington, we welcome the Mayor’s executive actions affirming Seattle’s commitment to safety, dignity and community autonomy. Restricting the use of masks by federal enforcement officers helps protect public trust and safety. When unidentified, armed individuals appear in our neighborhoods, community members understandably call 911, fearing kidnappings or violence. These situations harm not only immigrant communities but also strain local emergency systems and endanger all. Our communities deserve to know who is acting with state or federal authority. Likewise, starting military-style deployments undermines that public safety is rooted in trust, care, and local solutions, not intimidation or fear. These measures reflect Seattle’s dedication to protecting all residents, regardless of immigration status, and to rejecting tactics that threaten civil and constitutional rights as well as community wellbeing.”

Kathleen Carson, Board Member, Seattle Indivisible

“Seattle Indivisible joins this effort because our city must remain a place where no one lives in fear for who they are or where they come from. When federal agencies act outside the bounds of law or humanity, we have a duty to draw a line and defend our neighbors. This executive order is a statement of principle—that Seattle will not collaborate with cruelty. It will not give legitimacy to raids that tear families apart. It will not stand silent while human rights are violated in our streets. We know that words alone will not stop an armored vehicle or a deportation order. But solidarity—spoken clearly and lived out daily—still matters. It tells every person being targeted that they are not alone, and it tells every official planning escalation that we are watching, organizing, and will not yield. Our resolve is simple: whatever comes, Seattle Indivisible will stand with our immigrant and refugee neighbors and all being targeted by our federal government. Seattle will not be intimidated into abandoning its values.”",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/10/EO-Signing-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:57:51.536783

FAR-LEFT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PROFESSOR CHARGED WITH VIOLENT FELONIES DURING ANTI-ICE RIOTS IN BROADVIEW

The university stopped short of specifically commenting on Abdelhadi's arrest, and despite multiple requests, would not say whether she is still actively teaching courses. As of Wednesday morning, her biography page on the school's website remained active.

Court records show that Abdelhadi requested a jury trial during an appearance in Cook County on Monday. Her attorney declined to comment.

Hours before her arrest, she posted photos on X of a line of Illinois State Police officers guarding the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, and chastised the state and Gov. J.B. Pritzker for using state resources for that purpose.

Rioters and protesters have clashed with authorities outside the facility for weeks.

I keep thinking about all our neighbors and siblings—hundreds in Chicago alone—who’ve been detained into the unknown of horrendous facilities. We owe them resistance.""

Abdelhadi appeared on far-left Truthout's ""Movement Memos"" podcast the day before her arrest, where she spewed menacing messages about ICE and towards fellow left-wingers.

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they’re setting up shop. I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community,"" she said.

Abdelhadi is also a known far-left entity and anti-Israel activist whose social media accounts often reference a ""genocide"" in Gaza.

She made national headlines when she cursed out her own employer at the Socialism 2025 conference earlier this year.

It is the kind of place where King Mswati III—who took the throne as an 18-year-old four decades ago—can warn in a speech, as he did in 2023, that nobody should “complain if mercenaries kill” political activists. When one of the country’s leading human rights lawyers was murdered only hours later, the king’s representatives suggested there was no connection. No one was punished.

In other words, Eswatini is just the kind of country—small, untroubled by democracy, and presumably eager to avoid a superpower’s wrath—with which the Trump administration has been eager to do business.

In May, officials from the US and Eswatini signed a deal that allows the Trump administration to deport people from all over the world to the African nation. A copy of the arrangement I reviewed shows that the United States has agreed to pay Eswatini $5.1 million to take in up to 160 so-called “third-country nationals”—immigrants who came to the US with no ties to the country to which they are being deported.

In July, the first five of such men arrived in Eswatini, where they were sent to a maximum-security prison and detained in the country without any clear legal basis. Last weekend, the Trump administration sent 10 more people to the Eswatini prison. None of the 15 men sent to the nation are from Eswatini. But they are now under the authority of its king.

The situation is a “legal black hole,” according to Tin Thanh Nguyen, a North Carolina–based attorney who is representing five men from Vietnam and Laos now imprisoned in the African country. As he explained in a statement Monday: “I cannot call [my clients]. I cannot email them. I cannot communicate through local counsel because the Eswatini government blocks all attorney access.”

The arrangement with Eswatini, which has a population of 1.1 million, is similar to the deal that allowed the United States to send more than 200 Venezuelans to an infamous prison in El Salvador earlier this year. The Venezuelans sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT)—most of whom had no criminal history—were released in July as part of a prisoner swap following sustained international outrage. (As we reported, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeted many Venezuelans because of tattoos that the agency falsely claimed were evidence of gang membership.)

Although the CECOT disappearances led to international outrage, the Trump administration’s efforts to offload people to a prison in Eswatini, along with similar arrangements with South Sudan and other African nations, have attracted much less attention.

A practice that would have been unthinkable under past administrations is becoming normalized: sending ICE detainees, without due process, to far-flung prisons in countries with notorious human rights records.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin warned in a statement last month: “If you come to our country illegally, you could end up in CECOT or a country you didn’t even know existed.” Eswatini’s US Embassy also did not respond to a request for comment.

The legal pathway for third-country deportations became far easier over the summer.

In May, the Trump administration tried to summarily remove a small group of third-country nationals to South Sudan, despite a preliminary injunction from a federal judge in Massachusetts that clearly blocked the move. At an emergency hearing, Judge Brian Murphy found that DHS’s conduct was “unquestionably violative” of his preliminary injunction. He ordered the men not to be handed over to South Sudan.

In late June, the Supreme Court removed the protections Murphy put in place—effectively rewarding the Trump administration for flagrantly disobeying court orders. Justice Sonia Sotomayor excoriated the move in a dissent joined by Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan.

“Apparently,” Sotomayor wrote, “the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a District Court exceeded its remedial powers.” (At another point, Sotomayor compared the administration’s legal nitpicking in the case to an “arsonist who calls 911 to report firefighters for violating a local noise ordinance.”)

DHS quickly took advantage of the power granted it by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

In July, the department followed through on the South Sudan removals and announced the first five deportations to Eswatini. In a series of social media posts, DHS claimed the men were so “uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.” The posts said the men sent to Eswatini—who were from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen—had been convicted in the United States of serious criminal offenses, including murder and rape.

The severity of the crimes obscures the legal stakes of the case. All of the men DHS sent to Eswatini had served their sentences and been ordered deported. The question was (and is) not whether they can be deported, but whether the Trump administration has the authority to send people anywhere it wants, without due process, and imprison them in countries where the detainees have never broken any law.

Trina Realmuto, one of the lead lawyers in the case before Murphy, stressed that all of the class members she is representing have rights regardless of their criminal histories.

“But make no mistake,” said Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, “this is going to happen to people without criminal convictions.”

DHS did not name the people it sent to Eswatini but did share their photos. Through those photos, family members and friends in the United States learned that the men had been sent to a small kingdom on the other side of the world. It would be about two weeks before they were able to speak with them.

Nguyen, the North Carolina immigration lawyer, and two other American lawyers who took the cases of the men in Eswatini began working with Sibusiso Nhlabatsi, who is well known in Eswatini for his work as a human rights lawyer.

Nhlabatsi was also a colleague and close friend of Thulani Maseko, the activist and lawyer who was killed in 2023 while watching television at home with his wife and two young children. No one has been held accountable for his friend’s murder, and Nhlabatsi said he fears for his own “safety every day” due to his work. “It’s a risk that you have to take,” he told me. “Unfortunately, sometimes you have to pay the highest price.”

So far, Nhlabatsi’s efforts to represent the people sent to Eswatini from the United States have been thwarted by the kingdom. For the first time in his career, Nhlabatsi said prison officials have repeatedly denied him the chance to meet with his clients at the prison.

In response, Nhlabatsi filed suit to try to force the courts in Eswatini to allow him access to the men deported from the United States. But what has happened since has been Kafkaesque.

After taking the government to court, Nhlabatsi said a legal adviser for the country’s prison system told him that he would be able to meet his clients. But when he returned to the Matsapha Correctional Complex, which houses the maximum-security prison where the men are being held, Nhlabatsi said he was “pushed from pillar to post” and made to wait hours. Finally, Nhlabatsi said the head of the prison told him that he would not be able to meet with his clients after all. The reason was absurd: The prison director claimed the men were refusing to see him.

A close friend of Roberto Mosquera, the Cuban national sent to Eswatini in July, said Mosquera told her during a brief call that he never refused to meet with Nhlabatsi. She said officials in Eswatini “just blatantly lie and say that Mr. Mosquera refuses counsel.”

Mia Unger, an immigration attorney at the Legal Aid Society in New York, represented a man sent to Eswatini named Orville Etoria. “He requested to speak with us numerous times, and he wasn’t allowed,” Unger said. “They didn’t allow him to call us.”

Etoria’s story is particularly galling because there appears to be no basis for DHS’s claim that Jamaica, his home country, refused to take him back. Unger said Etoria, who was convicted of murder nearly three decades ago and released from prison in 2021, was asked by ICE to obtain a Jamaican passport at a check-in earlier this year. He got the passport, went to another ICE check-in in June, and was taken into custody. “There was never any question of whether he was able to go to Jamaica,” Unger said. As a result, it should have been illegal to send him to Eswatini. (US law makes it clear that people can be deported to third countries only when it is “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” to send them to countries to which they have close ties.)

After Etoria arrived in Eswatini, Jamaica’s government immediately made clear that it had not refused to take him back. And in September, after being imprisoned for two months at Matsapha, Etoria returned to the Caribbean island. (A Mexican national sent to South Sudan was also repatriated after the Mexican government facilitated his return.)

Alma David, an immigration attorney with Novo Legal, is representing Mosquera and Kassim Saleh Wasil, a Yemeni national in Eswatini. She told me the head of the Matsapha prison said via WhatsApp that the only way to have an unmonitored conversation with her clients would be for her or another attorney to come in person. She noted that Nhlabatsi had tried and been repeatedly turned away. In response, David said the prison chief told her that Nhlabatsi needed to go to the US Embassy to get permission to meet with his clients.

It is unclear what the actual policies are. “It’s a monarchy,” David explained. “Nobody wants to be the person who does the wrong thing or does the thing they’re not supposed to do. But nobody really knows what they’re supposed to be doing.”

“All of these people had served their sentences,” she stressed of the men sent to Eswatini. “They were living in the community and were not considered a danger to anybody until one day, they were picked up and sent to Eswatini.”

When we first spoke late last month, Nhlabatsi said he would soon be in court to secure an order allowing him to meet with the men sent from the United States. Last Friday, he said the court ordered him to have access. But it came with a major caveat: The government immediately appealed the judgment.

It means that Nhlabatsi is likely months away from being able to meet with his clients—if he is able to do so at all. The goal appears to be to try to stonewall until the men are removed from Eswatini, at which point their claims would become moot.

Nhlabatsi said the case has become big news in his country. Many residents have not been happy to learn that their government is holding people convicted of serious crimes in the United States. In contrast to the propaganda video El Salvador released after Venezuelans arrived at CECOT, Eswatini’s government seems to have tried to draw as little attention as possible to what it’s doing on behalf of the United States. (Nhlabatsi said he does not believe that the men are being physically abused while in custody but added that being in prison is bad enough.)

ICE is now doubling down on these deportations. Nguyen, the North Carolina lawyer, said ICE told a group of men in detention in the United States on Saturday that they were about to be deported to Eswatini. Nguyen said the new group of deportees includes people from Cambodia, Chad, Cuba, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Flight tracking records indicate that the plane carrying them arrived in the nation around midnight Monday. (Unlike the first five people sent to Eswatini, this group was able to make short calls after arriving in the country, according to Nguyen.)

Court records show that Mosquera, the Cuban national sent to Eswatini in July, was arrested in 1988 and later convicted of attempted first-degree murder. (ICE has incorrectly claimed that he was convicted of homicide.) He later was ordered deported, but the federal government was apparently unable to remove him to Cuba, which has often refused to accept deportees. Following additional arrests in 2008 and 2015, Mosquera was convicted of offenses including grand theft auto, assaulting a law enforcement official, and misdemeanor assault.

Mosquera’s close friend, who requested anonymity due to fear of potential retaliation by ICE, said Mosquera had “paid his dues to society” and had turned his life around by the time he was detained by ICE at a routine check-in in June. She said Mosquera, who came to the US as a boy more than 40 years ago, should never have been sent to a prison in a country where he has never committed a crime.

“I used to believe in the Constitution,” Mosquera’s friend said. “I used to believe that I lived in the greatest country in the world.” She explained that she was born in the US after her parents left Cuba in the early 1960s. “But this is not the America that I grew up in,” she continued. “This is a whole different America.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25262501672131-master.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-10-08 15:57:54.847166
,Agencies,2025-10-08 17:27:33+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,"ICE agents target New York City immigration courts more often than others, new analysis suggests",Julia  Ingram,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-agents-new-york-city-immigration-courts-analysis/,"The estimates, by mathematician Joseph Gunther, are the first attempt to quantify arrests in immigration courts at a national level.
Gunther identified nearly 2,400 ICE arrests likely made in immigration courts across the country, a total he said may still be an undercount.
To quantify courthouse arrests, Gunther cross-referenced data on ICE arrests from the Deportation Data Project with data on immigration court hearings from the Executive Office for Immigration Review.
Cutler, the New York immigration attorney, said that ICE agents have told her they are specifically targeting New York City because of its sanctuary policies.
Following New York, Gunther's analysis found there were 190 ICE arrests in El Paso that likely took place in immigration court.","Tensions at Manhattan's immigration courts are reaching a boiling point.

Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reinstated the officer who was initially relieved of duties after shoving an Ecuadorian woman to the ground as he arrested her husband. The next day, ICE agents shoved journalists, sending one to the hospital.

""Every single week I would ask myself, is this when everything is going to fall apart and explode, and I'm still waiting for it, but we're getting closer,"" said Allison Cutler, an immigration attorney from New York Legal Assistance Group who is in court at 26 Federal Plaza almost every day.

New York City has seen 460 ICE arrests this year through July that likely took place in immigration court, more than in any other city, a new analysis of federal data found. The estimates, by mathematician Joseph Gunther, are the first attempt to quantify arrests in immigration courts at a national level.

Gunther identified nearly 2,400 ICE arrests likely made in immigration courts across the country, a total he said may still be an undercount. The analysis fills a gap left by the lack of DHS reporting on how many arrests ICE has made in or around courts.

Those arrested very rarely had criminal records, the analysis found. Over 90% had only civil immigration charges, such as crossing the border illegally.

ICE did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the analysis, but Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release that ""arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense.""

""It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be,"" she said. ""These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.""

To quantify courthouse arrests, Gunther cross-referenced data on ICE arrests from the Deportation Data Project with data on immigration court hearings from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. ICE data does not have precise location information on arrests. But by comparing dates, places and demographic information between the two datasets, Gunther compiled a list of arrests that likely took place on the same day as a court hearing. The methodology was reviewed by two immigration experts.

""These are the first general estimates of something that shouldn't be secret in the first place,"" Gunther said. ""It shouldn't be necessary at all to do this drawn-out data analysis to know such basic facts.""

ICE began making arrests at immigration courts in late May, when DHS rescinded Biden-era guidance limiting them.

DHS attorneys then began moving to dismiss cases and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Once immigrants face expedited removal, they are detained and are not entitled to any more hearings before a judge.

Previously, expedited removal had been mostly limited to migrants encountered near the border. In January, the Trump administration expanded that to apply to undocumented immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who entered less than two years ago.

On Aug. 30, a federal judge paused this expansion, blocking ICE's strategy of fast-tracking deportations of those with dismissed cases.

ICE is also arresting immigrants in court with ongoing cases, immigration attorneys and court watchers said.

""A lot of immigration judges say, I'm going to give you another court date, but I don't know what will happen when you leave this court room,"" said Dee Ann Croucher, a volunteer who observes hearings in El Paso multiple times a week. ""I saw a lady just break down sobbing when they said that to her.""

The woman was detained in the hallway after the hearing, Croucher said.

Immigrants arrested in court are often transferred far from home and family, limiting access to legal representation and sometimes placing them in a more conservative court system, immigration attorneys said.

A CBS News analysis of the arrests Gunther identified found that nearly all were transferred to another facility, often hundreds of miles away. Those arrested in New York were moved an average of more than 1,000 miles away, often to Texas or Louisiana.

Some have been released from detention after federal judges ruled their detainment was unlawful, but not everyone has the legal resources to file a petition, said Hasan Shafiqullah, immigration supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society.

""Many people are languishing in detention,"" he said. ""Because detention is so terrible, people are often giving up and just saying, ""You know what? Just give me a deportation order.""

In Miami, some are choosing to self-deport after ICE arrested them in court, said Miami immigration attorney Antonio Ramos, whose office is in the same building as the court.

Miami's immigration court sees the second-most hearings for non-detained immigrants, following New York. There have been about a third of estimated in-court arrests in Miami than in New York this year, according to the analysis.

New York City's immigration courts see more non-detained hearings than any other city. Cutler, the New York immigration attorney, said that ICE agents have told her they are specifically targeting New York City because of its sanctuary policies.

""I've had officials tell me this to my face that they are punishing New York,"" she said. ""They would say, when New York stops being a sanctuary city, that is when we will leave.""

DHS has been clear that New York and other cities with sanctuary policies will be the target of increased enforcement, but did not respond to inquiries from CBS News about how they choose which courts to deploy ICE officers to.

Following New York, Gunther's analysis found there were 190 ICE arrests in El Paso that likely took place in immigration court. Immigration courts in the Los Angeles area — within the city itself and in Van Nuys and Santa Ana — also had a high number of estimated arrests when combined, at 282.

Immigration advocates who observed the arrests in El Paso's court described a less hostile atmosphere and no instances of excessive force. In one case, volunteers were able to negotiate with ICE agents to allow a noncitizen with a medical disorder to be electronically monitored instead of being detained, said Emily Miller, program manager at the Border Immigration Law and Justice Center in El Paso.

""We have developed a cordial relationship with ICE,"" said Miller, who helps coordinate a group of volunteer court watchers. ""Whether we agree with what [ICE is] doing or not, there is no yelling and filming taking place anymore. At the beginning, there was yelling and filming, we saw ICE be more forceful, that has stopped.""

Twenty-one of the arrests in El Paso were of children who were arrested with their family members, the analysis estimated. It identifies a total of 73 children arrested, almost all in Texas or the Los Angeles area, and none in New York.

The Biden-era memo had prohibited courthouse arrests because it would ""disincentivize noncitizens from appearing for their hearings."" When a noncitizen does not appear for their hearing, an immigration judge may order them removed ""in absentia.""

Immigrants face ""an impossible catch 22,"" said Amy Belsher, supervising attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union: show up to court and risk arrest, or stay home and receive a deportation order.

The rate of ""in absentia"" removal orders have ticked upward from 46% of non-detained case completions in May, when the arrests first started, to 52% in August.

""It's going to do lasting and irreparable harm to noncitizens' trust in government systems,"" Belsher said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/07/2bdab084-d418-427d-8207-4994409f283b/thumbnail/1200x630/2281a3a2f4f84d0e523e8ef836b63925/gettyimages-2239572864.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 14:56:31.767510

However, the country’s migration pathways do not take into account the effects of climate change and disasters.
This includes the Pacific Access Category Resident Visa (PAC), which provides permanent residency to a limited number of nationals of Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga and Fiji.
“Taking action on climate change and displacement is no longer a political choice but a legal obligation.
“In 2015 we applied for the PAC visa and in 2016 my husband left with our daughter.","Over recent years, as climate change and disasters deepen social inequalities and economic hardship across the Pacific, many have felt their best option is to migrate. For many Tuvaluans and I-Kiribati, Aotearoa New Zealand is the most viable destination given the countries’ close historic and cultural ties.

However, the country’s migration pathways do not take into account the effects of climate change and disasters. This includes the Pacific Access Category Resident Visa (PAC), which provides permanent residency to a limited number of nationals of Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga and Fiji.

The PAC scheme is only available to people between 18 and 45 years of age, who can secure a job offer and prove they have an “acceptable standard of health”. This excludes anyone with impairments that are associated with a disability, as well as anyone living with certain medical conditions perceived to represent a cost for Aotearoa New Zealand.

“For many people in Tuvalu and Kiribati, staying or leaving is not a matter of choice but survival,” Agnès Callamard said. “Pacific Island communities have shown extraordinary resilience in pursuing adaptation and mitigation strategies to enable people to remain on their lands, but the Aotearoa New Zealand government needs to do more to support them, without discrimination.”

It is simply unacceptable for a high emitting country like Aotearoa New Zealand to claim it cannot take people apparently due to the cost they could generate, especially knowing that people with disabilities face increased risks during climate-induced extreme weather events.

Agnès Callamard

Amnesty International met with several individuals with disabilities and their families, who were separated as a result of the visa requirements.

Alieta, a teacher and mother from Tuvalu with a visual impairment, had to remove her name from her family’s PAC application to enable her six-year-old daughter and husband to go to Aotearoa New Zealand in 2016. She has been separated from them ever since.

Talking about the impact of climate change, Alieta explained: “When the high tide came, the whole road and the house flooded… that’s why I want to move away from the sea.” She said that she agreed to her daughter going to New Zealand because she wants a better life for her, even though she finds it very hard to be apart.

“In the beginning I was not angry at New Zealand. I kept on asking for a visa… But I am sad for my daughter. I didn’t want to be separated from my daughter. It is hard on children.”

Agnès Callamard said: “It is simply unacceptable for a high emitting country like Aotearoa New Zealand to claim it cannot take people apparently due to the cost they could generate, especially knowing that people with disabilities face increased risks during climate-induced extreme weather events.”

Tuvalu and Kiribati – on average two metres above sea level – are particularly exposed to the effects of sea level rise. Coastal erosion, floods and droughts, as well as water and soil contamination and salinisation, dramatically limit the availability of drinking water and land to grow food and build homes. This is having a particularly severe impact on people’s health, particularly older people and those living with disabilities.

Aleki, who lives with her husband, her four children and her sister’s family in Funafuti, Tuvalu’s capital, told Amnesty International that obtaining clean drinking water has become a challenge: “We take buckets and go to the government building for filtered water every day for drinking.”

There are heat waves, droughts and king tides and they have destroyed all these plants.

A 56-year-old I-Kiribati woman

Soil contamination from salty water, which renders it unusable for growing most crops, is such an issue in Kiribati that the island is now nearly entirely dependent on imported food, which is often limited in variety and prohibitively expensive.

A 56-year-old I-Kiribati woman told Amnesty International: “In Kiribati you hardly find good food. You can find only rice and canned stuff. You don’t have vegetables or stuff like that. We don’t grow our food at home. There are heat waves, droughts and king tides and they have destroyed all these plants.”

The situation is also precarious for people who manage to reach Aotearoa New Zealand and fall into irregular status after their visas expire. With no access to dedicated protection mechanisms, those in this situation live with the constant fear of deportation, and are unable to access public services, including healthcare and education.

Under international human rights law, everyone has the right to be protected against forcible removal to a place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations, including due to climate change and disasters.

“Amnesty International is calling on Aotearoa New Zealand to urgently reform its immigration policies to align with a rights-based approach to climate displacement. In doing so, the government must develop and implement policies consistent with Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Indigenous Peoples’ rights,” Agnès Callamard said.

The Pacific is sounding the alarm. If the world fails to act here, it will fail everywhere.

Agnès Callamard

This would include offering dedicated humanitarian visas that prioritize those who are unable to meet the existing immigration requirements, to ensure the rights, including family unit, of those migrating. Dedicated protection mechanisms against deportation are also needed, including suspension of deportations for nationals of Tuvalu and Kiribati.

“Aotearoa New Zealand – and the international community at large – must act now to protect, respect and promote the rights and dignity of Pacific People in the face of the climate crisis, both at home and in their country of destination. Anything less is a betrayal of our shared responsibility to uphold human rights and ensure climate justice,” Agnès Callamard said.

“Taking action on climate change and displacement is no longer a political choice but a legal obligation. The Pacific is sounding the alarm. If the world fails to act here, it will fail everywhere.”

Alieta, 55, is a teacher and mother from Tuvalu with a visual impairment. In 2016, she was left with no choice but to remove her name from her family’s PAC visa application to enable her husband and six-year-old daughter to go to Aotearoa New Zealand. She has never been able to visit her daughter in Aotearoa New Zealand after all her visitor visa applications got rejected.

“In 2015 we applied for the PAC visa and in 2016 my husband left with our daughter. We went to Fiji, but I got stuck there waiting. I stayed there to try and re-apply for my own visa. The first time, with the PAC application, I was not accepted because of my disability. I have low visibility; I can only see short distances.

The first form [registration to the ballot] does not mention disabilities. It is only at the second stage that the forms say that people with disability cannot apply. I was sad during the application process. I would not have applied for the family to go in the first place if I had known that they would not accept people with disability. I did not want our family to be separated.

I have a disability, but I wanted my daughter to be proud of me. I was thinking if I went to New Zealand, I would try my best to find a good job there, so that she would be proud of me, of what I would be doing for her.

When the high tide came, the whole road and the house flooded

I wanted [my husband] to have a good job for schooling our daughter and I think of climate change here. I am scared of climate change.

Climate change and people with disabilities… It’s very difficult for us. I was staying in a place very near to the sea, between the ocean and the lagoon. When the high tide came, the whole road and the house flooded. The rain came into the house. In these situations, it is difficult for us as people with disabilities to move around, but [staying in] the house is not safe either. During bad weather, we just stay inside… that’s why I want to move away from the sea.

I was trying to be strong for my daughter

When my daughter said goodbye, at boarding time, she was crying and said: ‘Oh mum, I don’t want to go, I want you to come!’ I was trying to be strong for my daughter, I wanted my daughter to go so to give her an education. I wanted a good life for her future. [As a teacher], I had followed early childhood education courses, so I knew how hard it would be for my child. I was not showing her how weak I was feeling.

After they left in 2015, I met them only once, in Fiji, in 2017 for a one-month visit. I call my daughter and talk to her, but since then, we never met again. I speak to my daughter, but my husband has blocked me… The first time, with the PAC application, I could not go. I went to the people’s lawyer here in Tuvalu, and he said to reapply again for a visa. I applied for a visitor visa from Fiji in 2017 and was still rejected. I applied 2-3 times, and it was always declined. I paid AU$200-300 for each application.

In the beginning I was not angry at New Zealand. I kept on asking for a visa… But I am sad for my daughter. I didn’t want to be separated from my daughter. It is hard on children.”",https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/304370-1024x433.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:57:47.114667

Immigrants form a growing share of the U.S. population and workforce, and as of 2024, there were over 50 million immigrants residing in the country. President Trump’s agenda has focused on restricting immigration and enhancing immigration enforcement, which research shows has negative impacts on the mental and physical health of immigrant families, including the millions of U.S. citizen children living in them, as well as broader economic effects on communities. The Trump administration and Congress also have made policy changes that further restrict access to health coverage and care for immigrant families.

This issue brief provides an overview of Trump administration and Congressional actions that are likely to impact immigrants’ access to health coverage and care, including new restrictions on eligibility for health coverage and services as well as changes in immigration enforcement and other policies. Together, these changes will likely increase uninsured rates and reduce access to care among immigrants and their children. Over the long-term, these changes may also lead to worse health outcomes and have negative impacts on the U.S. economy and workforce, given the major role immigrants play, particularly in certain industries, including health care, agriculture, and construction.

Reductions in Access to Health Coverage

The 2025 tax and budget law includes significant cuts to the Medicaid program as well as eligibility restrictions that make many lawfully present immigrants (LPIs) ineligible for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces, and Medicare coverage. Under the new law (H.R.1), eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP, subsidized Marketplace coverage, and Medicare will be limited to lawful permanent residents (LPRs or “green card” holders), Cuban or Haitian entrants, and citizens of Compact of Free Association (COFA) residing in the U.S (Table 1). States can also maintain Medicaid and CHIP coverage for lawfully residing pregnant people or children covered through a state option as well as through the “From-Conception to End of Pregnancy” option, which provides coverage to low-income children regardless of their parent’s immigration status. This change will make many groups of lawfully present immigrants ineligible for coverage, including refugees, asylees, people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), as well as individuals on work visas, among others. The law also eliminates eligibility for subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage for all lawfully present immigrants with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) who do not qualify for Medicaid coverage due to immigration status. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that these coverage restrictions will result in 1.4 million LPIs becoming uninsured with $131 billion in reduced federal spending and $4.8 billion in increased federal revenues by 2034. There is no effect on coverage of undocumented immigrants, who are already ineligible for all federally funded health coverage. Some states use their own money to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants.

The new eligibility restrictions for lawfully present immigrants have staggered implementation dates. The eligibility restrictions for Medicare became effective July 4, 2025 (the date that the 2025 tax and budget law was enacted), and current beneficiaries subject to the new restrictions will be disenrolled from coverage no later than 18 months from enactment of the legislation (January 4, 2027). Eligibility for subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage for lawfully present immigrants with incomes below 100% FPL ends January 1, 2026, while the other restrictions for subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage take effect as of January 1, 2027. The eligibility restrictions for Medicaid and CHIP go into effect October 1, 2026 (Table 2).

Beyond changes in the law, enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025, which will make coverage unaffordable for many immigrants and likely lead to coverage losses. Without renewal of the enhanced tax credits, average premiums could rise by over 75%, and in some states, they may even double. As a result, total Marketplace enrollment is projected to fall from 22.8 million in 2025 to 18.9 million in 2026 and 15.4 million by 2030. Without enhanced subsidies, many immigrants who remain eligible could lose access to affordable coverage, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid to adults.

Some states also have reduced or eliminated state-funded coverage designed to fill gaps in federally funded coverage for immigrants. Three states (California, Illinois, and Minnesota) plus D.C. have recently proposed or enacted budgets to end or limit new enrollment of adults in state-funded health coverage programs for immigrants regardless of immigration status as part of broader efforts to reduce state budget deficits.

Regulations published by the Trump Administration in June 2025 eliminated ACA Marketplace eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients on August 25, 2025. Under earlier policy, individuals with DACA status were not considered lawfully present for purposes of health coverage eligibility and remained ineligible for Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA Marketplace coverage despite having a deferred action status, which otherwise qualified for Marketplace coverage. These eligibility restrictions left DACA recipients ineligible for federally funded health coverage programs. The Biden administration published regulations that made DACA recipients newly eligible to purchase ACA Marketplace coverage with premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions beginning November 1, 2024. Following legal challenges, implementation of the Biden administration regulations was limited to 31 states and D.C. New regulations published by the Trump administration once again made DACA recipients in all states and D.C. ineligible for ACA Marketplace coverage. Most states will terminate coverage for enrolled DACA recipients on September 30, 2025.

The Trump administration published new guidance regarding verification of citizenship and immigration status of Medicaid enrollees, which could contribute to disenrollment due to challenges providing documentation. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), states will be required to separately verify the citizenship or immigration status of individuals whose status cannot be confirmed through federal databases such as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system based on monthly enrollment reports. Under already existing policies, in addition to meeting other eligibility requirements, lawfully present immigrants must have a “qualified non-citizen” status to be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, and many, including most lawful permanent residents or “green card” holders, must wait five years after obtaining qualified status before they may enroll. States already are required to verify citizenship and immigration status with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) SAVE system to determine eligibility for Medicaid coverage at the initial application and provide Medicaid benefits to applicants during a “reasonable opportunity period” of 90 days while their immigration status is being verified, if they otherwise meet all eligibility criteria. Although some implementation details of the new verification process announced by CMS remain unclear, it is possible that states will need to re-verify the eligibility of enrollees identified in reports and applicants may need to provide paperwork as proof of their eligible immigration status for manual verification, which could increase administrative burdens on both states and applicants or enrollees and potentially lead to coverage losses due to administrative challenges.

Restricted Access to Health and Other Services

The Trump administration issued a policy change that expands the list of health and other service programs that certain immigrants are prohibited from accessing. On July 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice of a policy change to update the definition of “federal public benefits” as outlined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) to add an additional 13 programs to the 31 programs considered “federal public benefits” that are restricted to individuals with a “qualified” immigration status. The notice further indicates that the updated list of federal benefits is not exhaustive, and additional programs may be added in the future. Among the 13 new programs added to the list are Head Start, the Health Center Program, and the Title X family planning program, among others (Box 1). This change bars many groups of lawfully present immigrants as well as undocumented immigrants from accessing several health care, educational, and other social services and will likely have negative impacts on the health and well-being of immigrant families. It also may create new challenges and complexities for service providers. This policy change was expected to take effect immediately upon publication of the notice in the federal register on July 14, 2025, although it provided for a 30-day comment period. However, the HHS had to delay implementation until September 11, 2025, following court orders. Further, on September 10, 2025, a District Court issued an injunction on the administration’s new policy, blocking the implementation of the policy as it relates to the Health Center Program and Head Start in 20 states and D.C.

Enhanced Immigration Enforcement

President Trump also has increased immigration enforcement activity to support mass deportation and detention, which research shows negatively impacts the health and well-being of immigrant families. The administration has shifted enforcement actions from focusing on criminals and recent border crossers to prioritizing all of the estimated 14 million undocumented immigrants for deportation, even though many have some form of temporary deportation protections. As a result, there have been increased worries about detention and deportation among immigrants, including among naturalized citizens, and immigrant families with undocumented immigrants report that immigration-related fears have worsened their mental health and well-being. KFF survey data from March 2025 find that about a third (32%) of immigrants overall say they have experienced negative health repercussions due to worries about their own or a family member’s immigration status (Figure 1). Immigrants also reported they avoided seeking health care due to concerns about costs and fears, were fearful of accessing public programs, and were confused whether these programs can negatively impact immigration status.

In January 2025, the Trump administration rescinded longstanding protections that prohibited immigration enforcement action in certain areas including health care facilities, schools, and places of worship. Based on a memorandum originally issued by the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2011, immigration enforcement actions were prohibited from occurring in “sensitive locations” such as health care facilities, schools, and places of worship, with limited exceptions. In 2021, the Biden administration issued an updated memorandum further strengthening and expanding these protections by including disaster relief areas and other sites of essential services on the list of “sensitive locations”. Following the recission of these longstanding protections by the Trump administration, there have been reports of ICE agents showing up at hospitals. Some health care facilities have invested resources into training staff on how to comply with the new policy. Health care providers also have expressed concerns about the new policy deterring individuals in immigrant families from seeking health care. In KFF focus groups conducted with likely undocumented Hispanic immigrants, several participants talked about avoiding seeking health care due to concerns about potential enforcement risks.

Immigration-related worries may be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s actions to share Medicaid enrollee information with enforcement officials. In June 2025, there were reports of the Trump administration sharing the personal and health data of noncitizen Medicaid enrollees with the DHS for purposes of immigration enforcement despite concerns related to the violations of federal and state data privacy protections. A federal court in California issued a preliminary injunction in August 2025 that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from sharing enrollee data for the purposes of immigration enforcement in 20 states that filed a lawsuit against the administration. Breaches or sharing of Medicaid enrollees’ information for purposes other than the provision of health coverage and care pose risks for individuals and may jeopardize confidence in the security of data held by agencies. They may also exacerbate immigration-related fears, potentially leading to immigrants and their children foregoing enrollment in health coverage or seeking health care.

The CDE encourages all California school districts to make these resources visible and accessible to families.","On September 20, 2025, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill (“AB”) 49, known as the “California Safe Haven Schools Act,” and Senate Bill (“SB”) 98 regarding immigration activity and enforcement in K-12 and postsecondary educational institutions. Both bills contained urgency language and therefore took effect immediately.

Please note that these newly enacted laws build on AB 699 and AB 21, both of which established policies and protocols to be followed in the event immigration activity and enforcement were to take place at California’s educational institutions with the goal of protecting all students irrespective of their immigration status, including those who are undocumented. AB 699 and AB 21, in addition to SB 54, known as the “California Values Act,” were addressed in our prior Alert.

Assembly Bill 49

Effective immediately, AB 49 amended Education Code section 234.7 of the Education Code regarding immigration enforcement officers’ access to school property. Existing law prevents local educational agencies (“LEAs”) from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of pupils or their family members. Existing law also requires a superintendent to inform the governing school board if immigration enforcement officials make a request for information or access to a school site for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws.

AB 49 expands section 234.7, subsection (a) to require an immigration enforcement officer or agent to present proper supporting documentation in order to enter school sites. Specifically, section 234.7 now prohibits an officer or employee of an agency conducting immigration enforcement from entering a nonpublic area of a school site without the following:

Valid identification, and

A valid judicial warrant, judicial subpoena, or a court order.

Section 234.7, as amended by AB 49, also prohibits LEAs from disclosing any personal information about a pupil or pupil’s family to an officer or employee of an agency conducting immigration enforcement, without the written consent of the pupil’s guardian(s). “Personal information” includes, but is not limited to, information about a pupil’s place of residence, education records, and travel schedule.

Lastly, AB 49 requires LEAs to maintain and update its policy limiting assistance with immigration enforcement by March 1, 2026, to align with the new requirements of AB 49 regarding immigration enforcement at public schools. LEAs are also required under AB 49 to make their policy available to the California Department of Education upon its request. AB 49 further requires the California Attorney General to update its model policies by December 1, 2025. LEAs can comply with the policy requirements by adopting the Attorney General’s model policies.

Senate Bill 98

SB 98 requires certain California postsecondary educational institutions to inform its community about any immigration-related activities expected to occur, occurring, or scheduled to occur, on campus. Specifically, effective immediately, SB 98 amends Education Code sections 32282, 47605, 47605.6, 47606.3, and 66093.3 to require postsecondary educational institutions to immediately notify all pupils, parents, faculty, staff, and other community members of certain postsecondary educational institutions of the presence of immigration officers on campus.

Additionally, SB 98 requires the following institutions of higher education to implement various precautionary measures, explained in greater detail below, when federal immigration enforcement activities take place on campus:

The California State University system

The Governing Boards of the Community College Districts

Independent Institutions of Higher Education which are Cal Grant qualified.

SB 98 also requests the Regents of the University of California to comply as well.

As part of above-referenced precautionary measures, postsecondary educational institutions are required to advise all students, faculty, and staff that they should notify the office of the chancellor or the president as soon as possible if they receive information that an immigration officer is “expected to enter, will enter, or has entered the campus to execute a federal immigration order.”

This newly enacted law also requires these postsecondary educational institutions to notify all students, faculty, staff, and community members when the presence of immigration enforcement is confirmed on campus. The notice shall include the date and time the immigration enforcement was confirmed, the location of the confirmed immigration enforcement, and a hyperlink to additional resources.

“Immigration enforcement” is defined as all efforts to investigate, enforce, or assist in the investigation or enforcement of any federal civil immigration law or federal criminal immigration law that penalizes a person’s presence or employment in the United States. “Immigration officer” means any state, local, or federal law enforcement officer who is seeking to enforce immigration law.

CDE Guidance

To support the implementation of these new laws, the California Department of Education (“CDE”) published a new toolkit titled Our Schools: Resources for Including Immigrant Families. The toolkit provides informational, family-facing posters that communicate assurance of schools’ obligation under the law to provide every child with access to an education in a safe learning environment, regardless of immigration status. The toolkit also provides guidance for best practices when immigration agents are present on school sites.

The toolkit is available on the CDE website and is currently available in both English and Spanish. The CDE encourages all California school districts to make these resources visible and accessible to families.[1]

They pulled out guns and handcuffed this young child.”

In response to the scenes, Newsom signed a bill last month barring local and federal law enforcement from wearing masks while on duty.

The new law quickly drew fire from federal officials. Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli instructed federal officers to disregard what he called a dangerous and unconstitutional law. In a recent interview on KCRA, Essayli accused California officials of passing the law because they “don’t want our immigration laws being enforced.”

“So they’re dehumanizing, and they’re delegitimizing the federal government. They call ICE agents kidnappers. They’re saying they’re making people disappear,” he said. “People are being arrested in compliance with federal law and the Constitution. … And all they’re doing with this bill and this rhetoric is putting the lives of our agents in danger.”

California’s latest immigration battle

The masking bill is the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle between California and the Trump administration over how federal law enforcement agencies operate in the state — a fight likely headed to court.

There’s already a pending federal lawsuit over President Donald Trump’s decision to seize control of the California National Guard earlier this summer and deploy guard troops and U.S. Marines to assist in immigration raids.

Last weekend, California also joined a lawsuit in Oregon challenging the president’s move to send National Guard troops into Portland. And legal battles over the state’s sanctuary laws, which prohibit state and local police from assisting in immigration enforcement, date back to Trump’s first term.

Essayli and other federal prosecutors have also aggressively pursued criminal charges against people who come into contact with federal officers, though many cases have been dismissed or reduced after grand juries declined to hand down indictments. In some cases, evidence contradicted Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security agents’ claims.

Critics say the aggressive tactics and lack of identification by immigration officers raise questions about both the rights of Americans and the accountability of federal law enforcement officers.

San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat, wrote the bill barring law enforcement from wearing masks. He said ICE’s “authoritarian tactics” are creating a combustible situation that makes law enforcement less safe by eroding trust with the public and opening the door to people impersonating law enforcement. It also makes it nearly impossible for Americans to know whether the people detaining them are actually law enforcement, he said.

The city of San José also passed a policy last week aimed at forcing federal immigration agents to unmask and identify themselves when they are working in the city.

“This entire ICE operation, essentially secret police, is terrifying and scary. Having ICE agents, and lord knows who else, vigilantes, bounty hunters, having them patrolling, roving around neighborhoods and grabbing people out of bus stops, out of their front yards, out their workplaces — it’s absolutely terrifying,” Wiener said. “You can’t even see the face of the person you’re dealing with. You don’t know who you’re interacting with.”

‘I’m a citizen. I am not doing anything wrong’

U.S. citizens, including George Retes, are among those being caught up.

Retes, a 25-year-old Army veteran and security guard, was arrested in July during a raid on the Ventura County cannabis farm where he works as a security guard. He was held for three days before being released without charges. After he wrote an op-ed about his experience, DHS accused him of assault on the social media platform X. No charges have been filed, according to his lawyers.

Retes said he tried to comply with orders as he approached the farm in his vehicle, but federal agents gave him contradictory commands before using tear gas, smashing his car window, pepper-spraying his face, pulling him out of the car and pinning him to the ground with their knees. He was transferred to a Los Angeles County facility and released without explanation.

Retes has filed a claim alleging unconstitutional detention — the precursor to a lawsuit — but his lawyers have been unable to identify the officers involved.

“I’m just trying to get to work. I’m a citizen. I am not doing anything wrong,” he said. “I thought everything was going to be OK.”

Retes missed his daughter’s third birthday during his detention, and was suspended from work for three weeks until he could prove he wasn’t charged with a crime.

Institute for Justice attorney Anya Bidwell, who represents Retes, alleged that his arrest and detention — and the threat of assault charges now being leveled at him — illustrate how ICE officers are comfortable acting with impunity.

Bidwell said federal regulations already require immigration officers to identify themselves when making arrests — a point noted in a letter earlier this year from Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, who demanded ICE agents unmask and identify themselves.

“This administration is kind of just exploiting the cracks that we have in the system,” Bidwell said. “Federal officials have such a high degree of immunity that they essentially don’t even care if they break the law.”

“They’re not following their own regulations,” she added. “But again, it doesn’t matter that they’re not following their own regulations, at least in their mind, because like, go ahead, sue me. What are you going to do?”

Local police caught in the middle

By contrast, local and state police in California are legally required to identify themselves in most cases, said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, or PORAC. The group represents 87,000 rank-and-file police officers in the state.

“You have to have either a badge or a name or identification indicating that you’re a peace officer in the state of California,” Marvel said, adding that after someone is arrested,” their name, their ID number and the agency they work for will be all available to that individual.”

PORAC opposed the masking bill, arguing that it unfairly entangles local police in a broader political fight that’s really about federal authorities. Marvel said no California agency uses masks to conceal identity, but the law could expose officers to lawsuits even if they cover their faces for legitimate reasons, like cold weather or to protect their health and safety.

Federal officials have made clear they will not comply. Before Newsom signed the bill, Department of Homeland Security officials called on the governor to veto it. In a statement, DHS insisted federal agents do identify themselves but wear masks to prevent doxing and retaliation from “highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin went on to blame Wiener for violence against ICE agents, saying that his legislation “and rhetoric comparing them to ‘secret police’ — likening them to the Gestapo — is despicable.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/BorderPatrolAgentsGetty.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:01:16.356602

Throughout the conference, a number of lawmakers continued to push misleading claims that Democrats are “fighting to give illegals health care”. Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for federally funded health care, except for emergency Medicaid – which is required under federal law.

Donald Trump has placed dozens of people with ties to the fossil fuel sector in his administration, including more than 40 who have directly worked for oil, gas or coal companies, according to a new analysis.

The report from Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy and ethics non-profit that has been critical of the Trump administration, alongside the Revolving Door Project, a corporate watchdog, analyzed the backgrounds of nominees and appointees within the White House and eight agencies dictating energy, environmental and climate policy. That includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.

The analysis comes as Trump wages broad attacks on climate and energy policies and on renewable energy. The president’s so-called one big beautiful act, for instance, opened swaths of federal land to drilling and mining and enshrined the rapid phaseout of incentives for renewable energy.

Johnson says federal workers should receive back pay, despite White House mixed messaging

House speaker Mike Johnson said today that he does believe furloughed federal workers should and will get paid, despite mixed messaging from the White House which has suggested that employees might not be guaranteed to back pay.

“There is some other legal analysis that’s floating around, I have yet had time to dig into and read that. But it has always been the case that is tradition, and I think it is statutory law that federal employees be paid,” Johnson said.

He went on to further chastise congressional Democrats, saying that their decision to hold out on passing the Republican-written continuing resolution, leaves them responsible for certain groups of federal workers not getting paid. “They voted that they did not want the troops to be paid. They did not want TSA agents to be paid. They did not want air traffic controllers, border patrol agents and all the rest. They live with that vote. They made that decision,” Johnson said. “The House is done. The ball is now in the Senate’s court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes. We did it. We sent the product over. It is clean.”

'This madness needs to end' say House Republicans, as shutdown enters eighth day

At a press conference, several House Republicans spoke to reporters as the government shutdown enters its eighth day. “This madness can end. This madness needs to end with sanity finally emerging,” said majority leader Steve Scalise, while continuing to blame Senate Democrats for not passing a House-passed funding bill. “Chuck Schumer, if you can’t do the right thing because you’re so afraid of your political job, think about the jobs of millions of families out there who don’t want to have that suffering inflicted on them.”

Throughout the conference, a number of lawmakers continued to push misleading claims that Democrats are “fighting to give illegals health care”. Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for federally funded health care, except for emergency Medicaid – which is required under federal law.

The arraignment of James Comey is now over, according to reporters in the courtroom. The former FBI director’s lawyers are also moving to dismiss the case, arguing that the federal prosecutor who brought the charges against Comey, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.

A reminder that Trump installed Halligan after he pressured her predecessor, Erik Siebert, to resign. The former US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia had said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Comey and other political adversaries of the president.

Outside the courthouse today, a small group of demonstrators gathered ahead of Comey’s appearance in court to protest against the criminal charges brought against the former FBI director.

Judge Nachmanoff has set a trial date for 5 January 2026, according to reporters in the courtroom.

James Comey pleads 'not guilty' at arraignment

Former FBI director James Comey has pleaded ‘not guilty’ during his arraignment at a federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. His attorneys have also requested a trial by jury.

Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff read Comey the charges he’s facing: one count of making a false statement and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding. Both are in relation to his testimony before the Senate judiciary committee in 2020.

Senate to hold sixth vote on stopap funding bills amid government shutdown

The US Senate will hold its sixth vote on the dueling short-terms spending bills to reopen the government at 12pm EST today.

Both bills are set to fail, yet again, as lawmakers continue to dig their heels in and trade barbs, blaming the other party for the shutdown, which has now lasted a full week.

A reminder that on Monday, only three senators broke ranks with the Democratic party, and voted “yes” on the House-passed continuing resolution to maintain government funding until 21 November. This still leaves Republicans nowhere near the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the bill.

GOP leaders in congress have continued to say that the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, is being pressured by the progressive arm of his party into rejecting the funding extension, which mirrors the bill that he signed back in March.

Democrats, meanwhile, say that their colleagues across the aisle have avoided any negotiations about their proposal, which includes several healthcare provisions – including an extension of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and could increase insurance premiums for millions of Americans.

As we prepare to you bring you the latest from James Comey’s arraignment in less than an hour, it’s worth noting the last time that a former FBI director was criminally charged was in 1978. When L. Patrick Gray, who actually served as the acting head of the bureau during the Watergate scandal, was indicted for conspiring to violate Americans’ constitutional protections by allowing unauthorized federal raids – as agents searched for members of Weather Underground, the left-wing militant group. The charges against Gray were dropped.

Trump says Chicago mayor ‘should be in jail’ for not protecting Ice officers

The president is already posting on Truth Social. As Texas national guard troops descend on Chicago today, Trump wrote that the mayor – Brandon Johnson – “should be in jail” for “failing” to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents.

Johnson signed an executive order this week, that stops federal immigration agents from using city property.

In his post, the president added that Illinois governor JB Pritzker should also be in jail.

A federal judge has set a hearing for Thursday, regarding the lawsuit that city and state officials in Illinois filed against the administration, to block the deployment of the military.

A reminder that the president designated the left-wing activist group a “domestic terrorist organization” last month, following the murder of his ally and conservative activist, Charlie Kirk.

Notably, officials haven’t established a link between Tyler Robinson, the man charged with killing Kirk, and Antifa.

Rubio to attend Paris meeting on Gaza transition - report

US secretary of state Marco Rubio is expected to attend a ministerial meeting to be held on Thursday in Paris with European, Arab and other states to discuss the post-Gaza transition, three diplomatic sources told Reuters.

The meeting, which will happen in parallel to negotiations between Israel, Hamas and mediators in Egypt’s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, aims to discuss how to implement a plan proposed by Donald Trump and assess collective commitments from countries.

The US embassy in Paris was not immediately available for comment.

National guard troops are outside Chicago and could be in Memphis soon

National guard troops are positioned outside Chicago and they could be in Memphis by Friday, the Associated Press reports, as the Trump administration pushes ahead with an aggressive policy toward big-city crime whether local leaders support it or not.

National guard members from Texas had settled in at an Army Reserve center in Illinois by early Wednesday, despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders. Their exact mission was not clear, though the Trump administration has an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation’s third-largest city, and protesters have frequently rallied at an immigration building outside Chicago in Broadview.

The president has called Chicago a “hell hole” of crime, although police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides.

In Memphis, Tennessee, police Chief Cerelyn Davis said a small group of commanders were already in the city, planning for the arrival of guard troops.

Republican governor Bill Lee has said troops will be deputized by the US Marshals Service to “play a critical support role” for local law enforcement, though that role hasn’t been precisely defined yet.

Democrats introduce bill to help federal workers cover childcare costs during shutdown

Michael Sainato

Congressional Democrats are introducing a bill that would provide childcare relief to federal workers affected by the shutdown of the federal government, as it drags on through a second week.

Parents would be reimbursed for fees paid to childcare facilities during the shutdown under plans initiated by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

Any federal employee who has been furloughed, or remains working through the shutdown without pay, would be entitled to support under the Federal Worker Childcare Protection Act of 2025.

The bill authorizes the General Services Administration to receive official documentation for childcare expenses from federal workers to apply for reimbursement.

“When you talk to federal workers right now, a lot of them are exhausted. They’re proud of what they do, but they’re tired of being treated like their lives are expendable,” Omar said in a statement on the bill.

“This administration has made it clear it’s not interested in standing up for workers – but I am,” she added. “As a working parent, I know the importance of having reliable childcare. This bill is a small but necessary way to show that their work and their families matter.”

About 100 childcare centers previously operated in GSA-managed federal spaces, providing childcare for thousands of children daily, but the so-called “department of government efficiency” eliminated the GSA office that managed these facilities earlier this year.

Co-sponsors of the bill include the congressional Democratic representatives Pramila Jayapal, Summer Lee, Gregory Meeks, Jerry Nadler, and Rashida Tlaib.

Six former US surgeons general – the top medical posting in Washington – warned in an opinion column published on Tuesday that policy changes enacted by the health and human services (HHS) secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, are “endangering the health of the nation”.

The surgeons general – Jerome Adams, Richard Carmona, Joycelyn Elders, Vivek Murthy, Antonia Novello and David Satcher – who served under both Republican and Democrat administrations, identified changes in vaccine policy, medical research funding, a shift in priorities from rationality to ideology, plunging morale, and changes to staffing as areas of concern.

Referring to their oaths of office, both Hippocratic as physicians and as public servants, the former officials wrote in the Washington Post that they felt “compelled to speak with one voice to say that the actions of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are endangering the health of the nation”.

“Never before have we issued a joint public warning like this. But the profound, immediate and unprecedented threat that Kennedy’s policies and positions pose to the nation’s health cannot be ignored,” they said, adding that they could not ignore the “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” of his policies.

Under a “Make America Healthy Again” (Maha) agenda, Kennedy has accelerated vaccine policy changes despite opposition from scientists, including narrowing eligibility for Covid-19 vaccine shots and dismissing members of a vaccine advisory panel.

He has cut federal funding for mRNA vaccine research for respiratory illnesses and instituted a review of vaccine recommendations. Kennedy also sought the dismissal of Dr Susan Monarez, former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Monarez testified before Congress last month that her firing by Donald Trump came after refusing a request from Kennedy to dismiss CDC vaccine experts “without cause”.

JB Pritzker as hundreds of National Guard troops seemed poised to enter the city where tensions are boiling over the Trump administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.

""Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!"" Trump wrote on his social media platform on Wednesday Oct. 8, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.

Pritzker responded defiantly, writing on X, ""I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?"" Johnson said he's ""not going anywhere"" and added ""This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested.""

The back-and-forth comes as Texas National Guard troops were seen assembling at the Army Reserve Training Center in Elwood, a village about 45 miles southwest of Chicago. Troops arrived after the White House ordered their deployment on Oct. 4 over the vociferous objections of local and state leaders, who filed a lawsuit challenging the move.

U.S. District Judge April M. Perry at an emergency hearing allowed the deployment to move forward but warned that any troop action before an Oct. 9 hearing could be used as evidence against the Trump administration.

Pritzker and Johnson for weeks have condemned increasingly aggressive ICE raids in the city and Trump's characterization of Chicago as ""the worst and most dangerous city in the world."" Earlier this week, Johnson signed an executive order establishing an ""ICE Free Zone"" prohibiting federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations.

The nation's third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration's intensifying deportation campaign and crackdown on crime in Democratic-led cities. Trump this week floated the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act if judges or leaders in blue cities continue to hold up National Guard deployments.

Protests break out as ICE raids ramp up in Chicago

Trump’s battle with Chicago has been stewing for more than a month, with the president threatening that the city would be next in line after deploying 800 National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., in August.

Trump says his Chicago-area immigration crackdown, called Operation Midway Blitz, is needed to apprehend ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. The stepped-up enforcement has fueled a simmering powder keg, heightening tensions in the city and spurring ongoing protests, especially at the ICE processing center in the suburb of Broadview, where several protesters were arrested last weekend.

This week, groups of nonprofits, unions, journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration saying federal agents responded to demonstrations ""with a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians."" Among the plaintiffs is a pastor who said federal agents shot him with pepper balls and sprayed him in the face with tear gas.

Protests swelled in recent weeks as ICE has launched highly visible and aggressive raids across Chicago. On Sept. 30, immigration agents descending from Black Hawk helicopters stormed and wrecked a South Side apartment building in search of Venezuelan gang members. Two of the 37 people subsequently arrested were ""confirmed"" members of the Tren de Aragua gang, the Department of Homeland Security said.

On Oct. 4, a woman was shot by a U.S. Border Patrol in a clash between protesters and immigration officers on Chicago’s Southwest side, while according to the Chicago Sun-Times, masked federal agents unleashed a chemical irritant outside a Logan Square neighborhood grocery store where protesters had blocked their progress.

'This is about consolidating power,' governor says

Pritzker has said the state ""won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator"" and called the activation of National Guard troops a ""manufactured performance.""

""I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,"" he said on Oct. 4, posting on X that the War Department had given him an ultimatum: ""Call up your troops, or we will. It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

According to immigration authorities, more than 800 ""illegal aliens including worst of the worst criminals"" have been detained since the blitz began.

But Illinois leaders fear Trump is using conflict between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters to justify troop deployment and to ultimately take control of the heavily Democratic stronghold.

""This is not about fighting crime, this is about sowing fear and intimidation among Americans,"" Pritzker said last month. ""This is about consolidating power in Donald Trump's hands.""

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has included Chicago among blue cities and states whose federal funds are being withheld during the ongoing government shutdown. Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that $2.1 billion in promised federal funds for Chicago's transit system have been paused.

At a hearing in June, Cummings stated that the consent decree remained in effect while the motions were pending.","CHICAGO — Federal immigration agents illegally arrested nearly two dozen people earlier this year without warrants in violation of a 2022 consent decree, a federal judge in Chicago ruled late Tuesday.

Immigration and civil liberties advocates based in Chicago sued federal authorities in March over the arrests of 26 people in the Midwest — including one U.S. citizen — during the opening days of President Donald Trump’s second term in January.

They claimed that such arrests violated a three-year consent decree banning warrantless arrests unless agents have probable cause to believe someone is in the United States unlawfully and is a flight risk. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings concluded that attorneys for the National Immigration Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois provided enough evidence to show that ICE arrested 22 people without a warrant in violation of the consent decree and federal law.

Cummings also extended the settlement agreement to Feb. 2 and ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to begin making monthly disclosures of how many warrantless arrests agents make each month until the agreement’s new expiration date.

The original 2018 lawsuit that led to the consent decree — referred to as the Castañon Nava consent decree — stemmed from a large-scale ICE enforcement operation in the Chicago area that led to 156 arrests during a weeklong period. Of those arrests, more than 100 were made without a warrant.

According to the lawsuit, ICE instructed its agents to circumvent federal law on warrantless arrests by having them create “post-hoc” warrants in the field for people who were already under arrest.

ICE officials previously denied that its agents violated the agreement, which it asserted expired earlier this year. It asserted that agents had probable cause to believe that the people it arrested without warrants would likely escape before they could get a warrant for their arrest. In other cases, warrants were prepared while people were detained for questioning, ICE officials said.

Cummings wrote Tuesday that issuing warrants to arrest people in the field was a “new policy that has never been implemented by ICE” prior to the consent decree. In 12 cases from Missouri that were cited in the lawsuit, the judge wrote, ICE later prepared post-arrest forms that Cummings said did not include any facts that would provide probable cause that any of the detainees were likely to escape before arrest warrants could be obtained. Subsequent forms provided a month later reflected details ICE agents did not know at the time they made the arrests, Cummings added.

“Today’s decision makes clear that DHS and ICE – like everyone else – must follow the Constitution and the law,” said Michelle García, co-counsel in the case and ACLU of Illinois’ Deputy Legal Director. “The federal government’s reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people – and then finding a justification for the action must end.”

According to Cummings’ order, the 22 people subject to illegal warrantless arrests have since been released on bond and are no longer in the custody of ICE. But Cummings ordered ICE to reimburse all bond payments and lift any imposed conditions of release.

ICE began violating the agreement with the January operation and completely ceased compliance in June, when its principal legal adviser sent an email to all ICE employees stating that the agreement was terminated despite pending litigation. On Tuesday, Cummings ordered ICE to reissue a broadcast that the agreement is again in effect “to all ICE officers nationwide.”

The judge also ordered ICE to, within 10 days, produce a tally of all foreign nationals subjected to warrantless arrest in the Northern District of Illinois from June 11-Oct. 7. It must continue to produce that data on the first day of each month between Oct. 22 and when the agreement expires.

“The court’s decision recognizes the scope and gravity of the constitutional violations the federal immigration enforcement operations have wrought on Chicagoans, both citizens and immigrants alike, as was so graphically perpetrated during the South Shore apartment building raid,” Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation for the National Immigration Justice Center, said in a statement.

“The court emphasizes that ensuring ICE has probable cause to make an arrest is more important than ever in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s Vasquez Perdomo racial-profiling decision. This decision gives us tools to hold DHS and ICE accountable.”

Attorneys: Family’s Millennium Park Detention Was Also A Violation

Prior to Cummings’ ruling, attorneys also filed multiple notices to the court of additional consent decree violations in which they alleged that ICE had “dramatically escalated” its enforcement in Chicago.

One high-profile case cited was the recent arrests of a family in Millennium Park.

Federal agents detained Noemi Chavez; her husband, Jaime Ramirez; their 8-year-old daughter, Dasha Ramirez; and their 3-year-old son at Millennium Park during a family outing on Sept. 28. Chavez told the Tribune that federal agents surrounded her and her husband as her children played in the Crown Fountain and asked if they had their “documents.” Chavez said that when she asked to see a warrant, her request was ignored.

In a Sept. 30 court filing, attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center wrote that the arrest was among many made this year “without warrants or any flight risk determinations.”

The Chavez-Ramirez family was detained as large groups of border patrol agents marched through Downtown. During the Sept. 28 patrol, Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino told WBEZ some of the people his agents are arresting are chosen based partly on “how they look.”

More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the Chicago area since the Department of Homeland Security launched Operation Midways Blitz at the start of September. The National Immigration Justice Center has identified more than 30 recent examples of warrantless arrests “lacking sufficient probable cause,” according to court documents.

The Castañon Nava consent decree was supposed to sunset in May. However, in March, the National Immigration Justice Center and the ACLU of Illinois filed a motion to enforce the consent decree and extend it for three more years. At a hearing in June, Cummings stated that the consent decree remained in effect while the motions were pending.

Last week, attorney Keren Zwick with the National Immigration Justice Center filed a habeas corpus petition with the U.S. District Court on behalf of the Chavez-Ramirez family. Originally from Guatemala, the family came to the United States in 2023 “in search of protection,” Zwick said. She said the family has an asylum hearing date set for October 2027.

During a Monday status hearing, Zwick told U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis she believed the family was “stopped because of their skin color.”

“I know I have no jurisdiction as to how ICE operates its enforcement procedures, but I will just say as an aside, I find it extremely troubling that there is no other indication that this family was not here legally and clearly they were stopped based on their appearance which, absent any other factors, is unconstitutional,” the judge said Monday.

After their detainment, the Chavez-Ramirez family was taken to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview before Chavez and the children were moved to O’Hare’s immigration-customs enforcement area at Terminal 5, according to the Tribune.

Chavez and the children were released Wednesday. But Jaime Ramirez was transferred from Broadview to the Port Isabel Immigration Processing Center in Texas and then to a facility in Clay County, Indiana, according to Zwick.

Jaime Ramirez originally came to the United States in the early 2000s, but he was deported. He returned in 2014 and was convicted of illegal entry and was served an order of removal, Zwick said. Jaime Ramirez returned with his family in 2023.

On Monday, attorney Craig Oswald, who is representing Bovino on behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said he believed federal agents discovered Jaime Ramirez’s past entries after the family was detained.

Marcos Charles, acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said last month that about 50-60 percent of arrests in ICE’s ongoing Chicago operation were targeted arrests. Yet in a recent filing in the Castañon Nava case, the National Immigration Justice Center wrote the remaining 50-60 percent of arrests are collateral arrests “which means they were warrantless and likely failed to comply” with the consent decree.

Filings from the National Immigration Justice Center describe cases where people were arrested on their way to and from work and church, an early morning raid in Elgin where two U.S. citizens were detained and an incident where a 5-year-old girl and her parents were arrested as they loaded groceries into their car.

“Together, the violations we describe in our court filing paint a picture of increasingly violent and dangerous arrests by [Department of Homeland Security] and other federal officers who show no regard for people’s safety or constitutional rights,” Fleming said in a recent news release. “We urgently need the court to hold the Trump administration accountable for the fear, family separation and physical harm these arrests are causing.”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/UBP5.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:59:08.535504

For months now, I have worked alongside rapid response teams that mobilize the moment there is word of an ICE raid or sweep.","While many families prepared their children for school Monday morning, Sept. 29, I woke up to calls from parents in Chicago too afraid to leave their homes. Rumors of immigration enforcement were spreading, and the simple act of walking a child to school felt like too much of a risk. I am a mother and an Illinois state representative, and these calls hit me in two places at once: as a parent who wants my child to grow up free from fear and as an elected official entrusted to protect the rights and dignity of my community.

Friday, the scene in my Chicago neighborhood included helicopters flying above and armed convoys patrolling our streets.

Some of our worst fears were realized the next day when, as NBC Chicago reported, ICE agents rappelled from helicopters onto a housing complex during a 1 a.m. raid and zip-tied people, including U.S. citizens and children, in the South Shore neighborhood. That’s near where my family has lived for decades. By all accounts the federal administration has used this exaggerated staging as a media opportunity without producing a shred of evidence that its use of excessive force was justified.

By Friday, the scene in my Chicago neighborhood included helicopters flying above and armed convoys patrolling our streets. In broad daylight, federal agents released multiple tear gas canisters into a crowd across the street from an elementary school. In a second instance, as a local TV station reported, agents released tear gas outside an emergency room in my community, and Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes, our City Council representative, posted a video of being handcuffed by ICE briefly after she questioned agents at that medical facility.

That is what makes President Donald Trump’s latest threat, that Chicago is one of the cities he wants to use as a “training ground” for the military, even more chilling. Trump is not only scapegoating our city and other cities for political gain; he is openly plotting to experiment on working families, immigrants and communities of color by turning our neighborhoods into staging grounds for authoritarian force. We must not turn away at this moment.

I know what militarization looks like, and it is not safety, it is fear. It looks like children crying when their parents don’t come home. It looks like families going underground, skipping school or work, because they are terrified of who might be waiting outside their doors. Militarization leads to trauma that lingers long after the raids end.

I know how this feels because I grew up with a mother who was undocumented. I grew up not knowing whether my mother would be there when I came home from school. I also know what real safety looks like. It looks like parents walking their kids to school. It’s stable housing, a living wage, health care and classrooms where children can learn without fear.

Chicago resists because it must. When Trump threatens to tear us apart, we come together through rapid response networks, neighborhood associations, congregations and coalitions of workers and students. The Chicago I represent is not a testing ground for militarization; it is a proving ground for democracy.

I grew up with a mother who was undocumented. I grew up not knowing whether my mother would be there when I came home from school.

And we are not powerless. For months now, I have worked alongside rapid response teams that mobilize the moment there is word of an ICE raid or sweep. We have turned resistance into law. In Springfield, I led the Safe Schools for All Act, which ensures schools remain safe from immigration enforcement. I worked to secure major state investments for Illinois’ Welcoming Centers and the Access to Justice program, in which immigrant families receive housing, health care and legal support that is denied to them in other settings. Additionally, I worked alongside the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights to ensure resources reached grassroots organizations on the ground.

As I reflect on the moment, I am reminded of the important work to follow. This veto session, Illinois lawmakers have a clear opportunity to take the next step: passing legislation to ban ICE from courthouses, health care settings and day care centers, places where people should feel safe. For too long, immigration agents have lurked in the hallways of our courts, deterring victims of crime and survivors of abuse from seeking justice. A courthouse should be a place where truth and fairness are protected, not where fear is manufactured. If we are serious about building communities where families can thrive, we must ensure that every resident, regardless of status, can access the justice system without intimidation.

I return to where I started. I’m a mother. When I walk my son to school in West Humboldt Park, I want him to see a city that welcomes families, not one that frightens them into silence. I want him to grow up knowing that leaders stood up against fear politics and that resistance is not only possible, but powerful.

Trump may see Chicago as a training ground. I see it as a home, one worth defending with everything I have as a mother, an attorney and a state representative. We will not be his training ground. No city should ever be used as a training ground; authoritarian reach is not acceptable anywhere in the country. I am part of a network of mothers, attorneys and elected officials at every level of government who will resist.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-broadview-il-chicago-suburb-ice-agent-ac-1159p-d08f2f.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 11:58:46.851159

Associated Press

President Donald Trump’s administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

The move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.

After the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”

The Latest:

Seeking more immigration barriers, Noem waives environmental protections in New Mexico

The Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.

In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.

The directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.

Laiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.

House Democrats press Trump on drug cartels he designated as terrorist groups

Several House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.

Five U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations.

The lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.

Justice Department names new head of immigration courts

A former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.

Margolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.

Margolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.

Past surgeons general argue HHS secretary is ‘endangering' nation's health

Six former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.

An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.

“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.

Oregon Gov. Kotek meets with DHS Sec. Noem in Portland

Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.

Noem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.

White House says it will use tariff revenue to bolster food aid program facing funding shortages

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Also known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.

Leavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”

Trump meets with American hostage freed from Gaza and with relatives of American killed there

Trump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Trump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says he’ll schedule the swearing in of new Arizona Democrat ‘as soon as she wants’

Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.

Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.

Once she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge blocks changed guidance for teen pregnancy prevention grants

A judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”

The ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”

Federal grand jury in Atlanta charges 2 men with making threats against ICE officer and his wife

Frank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.

Noto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.

Waszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.

National Guard members from Texas are in Illinois in Trump’s latest move to send troops to cities

National Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.

US authorities report 2025 border arrests at 55-year low

Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.

There were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.

The latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.

During September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.

Democrats ask Bondi about Tom Homan: Where’s the money?

As Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.

The investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.

“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.

Bondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.

“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.

GOP senator questions whether National Guard deployment to cities is ‘best practice’

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.

“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.

It was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.

Supreme Court seems skeptical about state bans on ‘conversion therapy’

The Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.

Most justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.

Justice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”

DHS Sec. Kristi Noem to visit Portland

The city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.

The city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”

Her trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.

A federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.

Trump praises Carney as a ‘world-class leader’ and ‘good man’

The president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”

But, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”

When asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”

Trump says he’ll meet with Xi in a few weeks

“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.

A meeting between the two leaders has not been formally announced.

Trump says his first-term trade deal with Mexico and Canada could be negotiated – or even replaced

The president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.

But asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.

He offered no further details.

The president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”

“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”

Trump suggests he’ll ‘follow the law’ on federal worker backpay

Asked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”

But asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.

Carney says the U.S. and Canada are competing, not in conflict

The Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”

Carney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”

“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”

GOP senator suggests FBI interview Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after his comments about Epstein

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”

During a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.

“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.

The attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.

Trump says there is ‘natural conflict’ with Canada

The president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”

“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.

Trump says back pay for furloughed federal workers ‘depends on who we’re talking about’

The president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.

He also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”

Trump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.

Chicago mayor says he doesn’t know where National Guard troops are in his city

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.

“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”

Johnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”

“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”

‘Law is clear’ on federal worker back pay, House Democratic leader says

“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.

“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”

Illinois braces for National Guard deployments amid legal challenge

Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”

A federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.

Bryan Stevenson, 65, is a civil rights lawyer and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit law group that represents imprisoned and condemned inmates. He has a message for those cultural institutions: expand your efforts, don’t retreat.

“We dishonor those who came before us if in this moment of crisis we remain silent,” Mr. Stevenson said. “I don’t think it’s just unempathetic. I don’t think it’s just cowardly. I think it’s dishonorable.”

Mr. Stevenson, whose memoir “Just Mercy” became a movie of the same name, has helped transformed Montgomery into a global destination for reckoning with the nation’s racial past. His E.J.I. Legacy Sites — museums and monuments focused on racial injustice — have drawn over two million visitors.

His newest site, the Freedom Monument Sculpture Park, opened in March 2024 on 17 acres, featuring work from more than two dozen artists and a towering National Monument to Freedom — a 43-foot-tall wall inscribed with the 122,000 surnames adopted by formerly enslaved people listed in the 1870 census. The park opened the same week Alabama banned teaching “divisive concepts” about race in public schools and universities.

The Equal Justice Initiative’s latest project, the Elevation Hotel, was designed as a sanctuary for visitors engaging with this difficult history. I interviewed Mr. Stevenson recently in Montgomery as he walked through the sites and prepared for the hotel’s opening on Oct. 8.

This conversation has been edited and condensed.

How would you describe the environment for cultural institutions engaged in telling the unvarnished story of our country’s racial history now?

I see the administration’s attempt to review and remove exhibits as proof that our work is critically important. I feel incredibly lucky that we’re eight years into establishing our major public history sites and cultural work. If we were just starting this effort, it would be too late to successfully fight back against this political push to erase certain difficult or inconvenient historical truths.

If you could bring Donald Trump to Montgomery right now, which of your sites would you take him to, and what specific truth would you want him to confront?

I would take him through the museum, just so he could understand the connection between what happened during the trans-Atlantic slave trade and today. It’s so interesting when he says, “Stop talking about how bad slavery was.” He thinks of himself as being anti-crime and tough on criminals.

Well, kidnapping 13 million people is a crime. It was a crime in the 15th century. There’s never been a time in human history where kidnapping was seen as acceptable. We’re talking about crime victims who weren’t just victimized for a day or a week; they were victimized for their whole lives.

He would never say to the people who lost loved ones on 9/11, “Oh, you guys should stop talking about what happened on 9/11.” He did the opposite. I want him to understand that what Black people went through is the exact same thing, except we never got comforted. We never got embraced.

And I would bring him to the lynching memorial because the people who were lynching Black people thought they were keeping the white community safe. This will send a very strong message about where that path leads.

Given the threats to federal funding and political scrutiny, what is the responsibility right now of cultural institutions focused on the Black experience and marginalized histories?

We’re going to have to do things that are uncomfortable. Given the knowledge and the resources and the privileges that so many of us have, we can’t afford to hope somebody else does the truth-telling for us.

We didn’t take any federal funding at our sites. You can get philanthropic support. You don’t have to take federal money. And if the federal government is involved and tries to take away the essence of these cultural institutions, I would advise them to tell the government, “Keep your money.”

I keep giving these talks, and I say, “They may try to take away our 501(c)(3) tax status, which would be devastating. But I would rather be a truth-teller and taxed, than to be silent and untaxed.” The room is usually just dead quiet, but I really feel that way.

Inside the Legacy Museum, visitors are surrounded by harrowing evidence, including the newspaper headlines celebrating lynchings and the audio testimonies of the wrongly condemned. How do you respond to the argument that we should not focus on this brutal, graphic history?

You have to be privileged and protected to go through life only thinking positive thoughts.

It’s like saying, “I’m going to the doctor, but I’ve already instructed my doctor, Don’t give me any bad news.” If your doctor isn’t allowed to be truthful with you, you’re going to get sick, and you’re going to die prematurely. So if you don’t want to be sick, if you don’t want to die, you have to be willing to hear the truth of your condition.

If we have the courage to hear the truth of this, there are things we can do to recover from this history of violence. It begins by committing to being against violence, being committed to the rule of law, to actually educating people about what happens when you give in to fear and anger.

Even in relationships, if you want to be in a good, healthy relationship, if you make a mistake and your partner is forbidden from giving voice to that, you’re just going to breed resentment and hostility. I just think that applies to history.

The new hotel is unusual. It is designed as a place of refuge for people who have toured Montgomery and your sites — a journey that can be incredibly emotionally draining and painful. Why do you see places like the hotel as important?

More than ever, those who are courageous enough to not be silent, to pursue the truth of our history, are going to need shelter. They’re going to need protection. They’re going to need help to navigate this moment, where it’s become dangerous to have museums and cultural institutions that are honest about history.

That image of Private Gordon and his brutalized back — that’s something we want everybody to see. Until you understand the brutality and cruelty of slavery, you’re not going to appreciate the harm it created.

You describe yourself and your historic sites as being part of a wider narrative struggle over telling the nation’s story. What do you mean by that?

I do think we’re in the midst of a narrative struggle. We won the deconstruction of legal apartheid. Now, we’re in a moment where I think the battle is a narrative battle. We can no longer rely on the rule of law alone. We have to engage in the storytelling, the teaching that helps this country recognize why we are still in a struggle for equality and justice.

You’ve described having to navigate these presumptions yourself, even as an accomplished lawyer. Can you share an example?

I was in a courtroom once, and a judge came in, saw me sitting there, and said, “Hey, I don’t want any defendant sitting in my courtroom without counsel. You get back out there in the hallway.” I had to apologize and explain I was the lawyer. They just laughed.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08nat-stevenson-qa-01-qzwm/08nat-stevenson-qa-01-qzwm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:58:39.653957

The outlet also has joined a separate lawsuit against ICE for what is being alleged as the unlawful treatment of journalists.
Local fire department officials have also complained about the fence.
“ICE’s illegally constructed fence on a public street, Beach Street, in the Village of Broadview, is an unacceptable risk.
The fence is currently blocking access for the Broadview Fire Department to businesses on that road,” Broadview’s acting Fire Chief Matt Martin said in a statement to Fox 32.","A suburb outside Chicago has sued the Trump administration for erecting an 8-foot fence around an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility, alleging that the barrier blocks emergency services and patrons from accessing the site and surrounding businesses.

The Village of Broadview asked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to remove the fence in the lawsuit, filed Friday, and cited a lack of medical staff present at the facility as another reason for concern, according to the nonprofit news organization Block Club Chicago. The outlet also has joined a separate lawsuit against ICE for what is being alleged as the unlawful treatment of journalists.

Local fire department officials have also complained about the fence.

“ICE’s illegally constructed fence on a public street, Beach Street, in the Village of Broadview, is an unacceptable risk. The fence is currently blocking access for the Broadview Fire Department to businesses on that road,” Broadview’s acting Fire Chief Matt Martin said in a statement to Fox 32.

“In case of a fire or other emergency, our fire trucks or ambulances cannot use the street to get to the scene,” he added.

Prior to the fence’s installment, protesters attempted to block the barrier from being put in place. Demonstrators have alleged those being processed at the facility are being forced to use toilets outside and sleep in rooms without beds before being sent to other federal sites, WBEZ Chicago reported.

Broadview Mayor Katrina R. Thompson attempted to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Friday to discuss the “danger created by the fence and to again ask for its removal,” Block Club Chicago reported, citing the lawsuit.

Noem, however, reportedly was unable to meet. Later in the day, the secretary posted a video on the social platform X criticizing the suburb after seemingly being denied entry into their municipal building for a bathroom break.

“It is clear that [Homeland Security], ICE, and their officials has developed, confirmed, and executed a policy, pattern, or practice of illegally trespassing on the Village’s property in defiance of the Village’s generally applicable ordinances,” the lawsuit reads.

The plaintiffs have requested a temporary restraining order in order to have the fence removed. They also asked a judge to declare the action unlawful under the Administrative Procedures Act and urged constituting the fence as a continuing trespass and public nuisance under state and local law, per Block Club Chicago.

An ICE spokesperson told the outlet the suit is “yet another political stunt by the local politicians fueling aggression against federal law enforcement in Broadview.”

“We will not apologize for decisive, lawful action to protect our personnel, facilities, and those in our custody, and to uphold the rule of law, and keep the community safe, something local authorities should be doing as well,” ICE spokesperson Emily Covington added in a statement.

The H-1B visa covers a broad range of highly skilled individuals in the US.
A substantial portion of those scientists rely on the H-1B visa to do their work.","The past two weeks may prove to be among the most consequential in the history of America’s H-1B visa program. For more than 700,000 skilled professionals living and working in the United States, a surprise executive order issued late last month threatened to upend their lives overnight.

Just two weeks after President Donald Trump’s proclamation imposing an unprecedented $100,000 fee on every new H-1B applicant, the legal challenge many immigration experts expected—but few anticipated in this form—has arrived. A broad and seemingly unprecedented coalition of labor unions, academic associations, religious institutions, and private employers has joined forces to take the administration to court.

The lead plaintiff, Global Nurse Force, is a healthcare staffing agency that recruits international nurses for U.S. hospitals. Other plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers (UAW), the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), and several faith-based organizations. Together, they have filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, arguing that the President’s action constitutes an unconstitutional overreach.

Represented by a consortium of advocacy groups and IMMpact Litigation—a joint venture of the immigration law firms Siskind Susser, Kuck Baxter, Joseph & Hall, and Bless Litigation—the plaintiffs argue that the president lacks the statutory authority to unilaterally alter the regulatory and financial framework governing the H-1B visa program.

The lawsuit states: “The proclamation transforms the H-1B program into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, to be granted at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security—a system that invites selective enforcement and corruption.”

READ: $100,000 ‘pay-to-play’ fee on H-1B visas faces first legal challenge (

In a conversation with The American Bazaar, leading immigration attorneys Greg Siskind and Charles H. Kuck—two of the principal architects of the legal challenge and co-counsels in Global Nurse Force v. Trump—explain why the lawsuit could become a defining moment in the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch in immigration law.

The American Bazaar: Can you walk us through the principal legal argument behind this lawsuit challenging President Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee order?

Charles Kuck: The authority invoked by the President does not allow him to condition entry on a tax or fee. Furthermore, since this is clearly not a fee or a gift, it constitutes a tax—and only Congress has the power to levy taxes.

The lawsuit highlights the case of Phoenix Doe, an Indian researcher whose work is now stalled. How representative is her case of the broader harm caused by the new rule?

Greg Siskind: Regarding Phoenix Doe, her case illustrates well the story we wanted to highlight. The H-1B visa covers a broad range of highly skilled individuals in the US. It has a common requirement of the position being bachelor’s level. But that hits every important sector in American society.

For decades, America has led the world in scientific research, thanks in large part to foreign nationals who come here to work in our universities and research institutions. As an aside, just today Michel Devoret—an immigrant from France who is a professor at UC Santa Barbara and formerly at Yale University—won the Nobel Prize in Physics!

A substantial portion of those scientists rely on the H-1B visa to do their work. We also wanted to emphasize the diversity of H-1B employers, since the proclamation—and much of the media coverage—tends to focus only on the tech sector. Yes, tech is important, and we believe H-1B workers there are incredibly valuable, but the visa is also used by religious organizations, schools educating our children, rural hospitals, and many other sectors facing severe shortages—employers who are in no position to afford a $100,000 tax on each worker.

READ: Trump’s H-1B crackdown puts tech and U.S.-India ties at risk (

Are there any previous cases where unilateral fee or tax impositions by the executive branch have been struck down by the courts? Also, what is the immediate legal relief you are seeking?

Charles Kuck: Yes, many courts have struck down illegal taxes and tariffs, and the constitution gives exclusive power to the Congress on these issues. As for the immediate relief — we are looking for the court to strike down the proclamation as unlawful.

Has there been any response from the administration or federal agencies since filing the case?

Greg Siskind: We have not heard anything from the administration to date. We also have not seen any communications from government agencies about the tax since we filed the case.

The plaintiffs include labor unions, universities, and religious groups—an unusual coalition. How did these diverse groups come together for this case?

Greg Siskind: As for the diversity of the plaintiffs, as I noted, the untold story of the H-1B is that it touches so many people in the country in direct and indirect ways, and we wanted to make sure this was known.

The proclamation is premised on the idea that the H-1B is just a visa to bring in cheap tech workers who displace Americans. First, that’s not true. But secondly, it obscures the point that the H-1B is used so broadly to fill critical worker shortages and that this rule means religious congregations won’t have clergy, health care clinics won’t have nurses and doctors, cancer research will slow significantly, and more.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-X-Court.png,N,,2025-10-08 08:56:29.090794

These voices are not partisan. They are principled. Having served on the bench with fidelity to law over politics, these jurists now step forward—not to advocate for any party or agenda but to illuminate the constitutional architecture that protects liberty and equality for all.

Their reflections are rooted in experience, not ideology. Their warnings are grounded in precedent.

At a time when threats to judicial independence are growing more frequent and more brazen, The Fulcrum offers this series as a civic resource and a moral compass. We believe that understanding how our courts function and why their integrity is essential to preserving the democratic experiment our founders envisioned is crucial.

Today, Judge John S. Martin Jr, who served as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York from 1990 to 2003, answered several important questions for the Fulcrum.

Judge Martin’s distinguished legal career has spanned more than six decades. Before his judicial appointment, Judge Martin served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983, leading one of the nation’s most prominent prosecutorial offices. Earlier in his career, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief Appellate Attorney in the SDNY. He also served as an Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General from 1967 to 1969. Judge Martin additionally held positions in private practice at several prominent firms, including Debevoise & Plimpton and Schulte Roth & Zabel, and was a founding partner of Martin & Obermaier.

Following his retirement from the bench, Judge Martin remained active in legal practice, serving as an arbitrator and consultant in matters involving commercial contracts, executive compensation, insurance coverage, and construction claims—routinely handling disputes valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Judge Martin is a graduate of Manhattan College (B.A., 1957) and Columbia Law School (LL.B., 1961).

His words are a reminder that the judiciary is not a tool of power; it is a bulwark against its abuse.

Why did the framers enshrine an independent judiciary—and how does that safeguard our democracy today?

The genius of the Constitution lies in the fact that it created three separate coequal branches of the government, each with an independent responsibility. Congress was to pass laws; the president was the chief executive who would execute and enforce those laws, and the judiciary was to provide a forum for citizens and others to litigate disputes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Most important, it was for the courts to have the final say as to whether either Congress or the president had overstepped their bounds and engaged in conduct that was either contradictory to or unsupported by something in the Constitution and laws of the United States. Thus, an important function of the federal courts is to ensure that neither Congress nor the president exercise power not granted by the Constitution.

Why are retired judges speaking out now—what compels you to break tradition and raise your voice?

The current political atmosphere has given rise to both physical threats to judges and efforts to undermine the independence of the judiciary.

Those who adopted the Constitution recognized the importance of having judges who were truly independent and who would act free from any pressure to do anything other than that which the law required. For that reason, the Constitution provided that federal judges should serve for life and could only be removed by impeachment and also provided that their compensation could not be diminished.

Why is using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions a threat to constitutional balance?

The Constitution prohibits removing a federal judge from office except by impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Thus, there is no grounds for an impeachment proceeding based solely on a judge's good-faith decision in a particular case.

Even though a judge cannot be impeached for a particular decision, the commencement of such a proceeding impinges upon the independence of the judiciary for two reasons. 1) it causes the judge to have to spend time and money defending a baseless proceeding, and 2) it inflames public reaction to such a decision and thereby creates a threat that someone will seek to injure the ""offending"" judge either physically or financially.

What do you wish more Americans understood about the role of judges in preserving liberty and equality?

Because of their independence, federal judges have the freedom to decide cases solely on the merits. That gives them the ability to protect the rights of each of us from any type of prohibited discrimination or from an unwarranted criminal or civil litigation.

What moment from your time on the bench best captures the weight—or wonder—of serving justice?

For me, the most difficult and most rewarding part of my work involved sentencing individuals for violation of criminal law. It was difficult because sentencing anyone to a substantial term in prison is an awesome responsibility. Federal law requires use of a sentencing guideline system, which in many cases can result in an unjust sentence if the guideline is literally applied. However, there are cases in which a judge can impose a sentence less than that set by the guidelines if the judge can articulate the existence of some factor that was not adequately considered by the commission that set up the guidelines. I think I did my best work as a judge in several cases where I dramatically reduced the sentences the guidelines established, using this exception. I think, for example, of the case in which I reduced the sentence of the mother of three young children from 3 1/2 years to seven months, and another in which I reduced the sentence of a low-level drug dealer from 19 to 12 years. Feeling that you are doing justice to those who may not have otherwise received it is one of the greatest satisfactions you can have as a judge.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov. Ron DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement, acted on a request by ICE and took the 20-year-old to jail following a routine traffic stop for speeding - he was a passenger in the car and was coming to Florida from Georgia for work. López-Gómez was born in Georgia.

He was released after the case received widespread media coverage.

ICE’s aggressive tactics have even sparked fear among some non-Hispanic, white immigrants who are in the country legally.

For example, Katia, a white South African immigrant who is a naturalized citizen and lives in Fairfax County, Va., says ICE’s approach prompted her in recent months to always carry her U.S. passport inside her bag. (Katia is not her real name; like Claudia, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from ICE). She worries about how an ICE agent would react if they heard her speak and noticed her South African accent.

Katia, who is in her 50s, works in communications for a social justice organization. She came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became a naturalized citizen in 1994.

She says that the type of tactics ICE is currently using was common in South Africa, which had an apartheid government at the time she emigrated to the U.S. “It was common practice for (South African) authorities to pull people off the street and ship immigrants off to their home countries. I didn’t think I’d ever see that happen in the U.S.”

When she became a U.S. citizen, “Americans were so lovely to me. People I would tell would give me a hug,” she says. “Randos would congratulate me. It seemed they were touched that I would want to become an American citizen. I don’t feel that way anymore.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation program is not the first time the U.S. government has carried out a campaign to expel immigrants on a mass scale.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched “Operation Wetback” to send Mexican immigrants, including some who were American citizens, to their native country. Border Patrol officers carried out the program, which lasted several months. At the time, Border Patrol officers claimed that 1.2 million people of Mexican descent were either arrested or left the U.S. on their own, but some researchers believe that number was exaggerated, and that the true number was in the hundreds of thousands.

The federal government at some point will pay a steep price in court for the overzealous tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol, a civil rights attorney says.

""The U.S. government will face significant financial liability in court for ICE’s aggressive tactics, says Cary J. Hansel, a civil rights attorney in Baltimore. Hansel adds that civil lawsuits on behalf of those unlawfully detained by ICE, alleging ICE is violating the 14th Amendment – which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provides “equal protection under the law” in addition to prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of due process – will lead to large jury verdicts or settlements.

“There will be a tremendous price to pay for this kind of lazy and unconstitutional conduct. In a democracy that values freedom, people should not have to show their papers to prove they belong. This conduct turns the Constitution on its head.”

The bishops presented the pope with letters from immigrants expressing fear of deportation and family separation.

Why It Matters:

This marks one of Pope Leo’s strongest interventions on U.S. immigration since assuming office in May. Although known for his more reserved approach compared to the late Pope Francis, Leo has recently become more vocal, questioning whether Trump’s anti-immigration measures align with the Catholic Church’s pro-life teachings. His comments signal growing Vatican pressure on the U.S. Church to take a firmer public stance.

Key players include Pope Leo, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Trump administration. The bishops especially from border regions such as El Paso are now under renewed encouragement to speak out on human rights and migrant protection, potentially heightening tensions between the Church and Washington.

What’s Next:

The Vatican has yet to issue an official statement on the meeting. The U.S. bishops are expected to discuss coordinated responses in upcoming conferences, while the White House continues to defend its immigration enforcement as a fulfillment of Trump’s campaign promises.

“Trump and [Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco] Rubio are pushing for regime change in Venezuela,” the account for the Democratic committee members posted on social media on Tuesday.

“The American people don’t want another war — and Congress can’t let any president start one illegally or unilaterally. That’s not how the Constitution works,” the group added.

Rubio has been leading the effort for regime change, the New York Times reported late last month.

The push for regime change would involve a “broad campaign that would escalate military pressure to try to force” out Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the Times reported. Administration officials have said that U.S. forces have struck four vessels in the Caribbean that they claim originated from Venezuela over the past weeks, killing 21 people so far. These strikes have been roundly condemned by human rights experts as illegal.

Trump administration officials have, indeed, been steadily escalating their rhetoric against the country. Last week, Trump reportedly sent a memo to Congress saying that he has “determined” that the U.S. “is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations.” It added that he has directed the Pentagon to “conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.”

Additionally, Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee highlighted that U.S. officials say the Trump administration has cut off diplomatic relations with the country amid an effort for a negotiated diplomatic agreement.

U.S. officials allege that Maduro is a leader of “narco-terrorists,” citing an indictment against him issued during Trump’s first term. However, the U.S. has not provided any evidence of this claim, and the National Intelligence Council has released an assessment saying that the Maduro government does not lead the Tren de Aragua gang as administration officials have claimed.

Democratic leaders have largely stayed quiet about Trump effectively declaring war without the permission of Congress. In fact, some senior Democrats are reportedly warning fellow members against opposing Trump’s war, saying that it would be tantamount to throwing their support behind Maduro.

Some Senate Democrats are reportedly seeking to force a vote on a war powers resolution, introduced last month by Senators Adam Schiff (D-California) and Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), in an attempt to bar Trump from using further force against Venezuela this week.

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed (Rhode Island), sharply condemned Trump’s “armed conflict” declaration last week.

“Every American should be alarmed that the President believes he can wage secret wars against anyone he chooses. Congress alone has the constitutional power to decide when America goes to war. The President cannot launch military campaigns and invent legal cover after the fact,” he said in a statement on Friday. “The Administration must immediately testify before Congress and the American people about this reckless campaign.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_10-07-trump-rubio.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:01:06.669422

Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker of serving the American public a ""smorgasbord of lies"" as it released a list that it says ""debunks"" his claims about federal law enforcement operations in Chicago.

The federal pushback comes as the Democratic governor and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson filed a lawsuit Monday to block the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas in Chicago and surrounding cities.

""Our message to JB Pritzker: Get out of your mansion and see Chicago,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""If JB Pritzker actually walked the streets of his own city, he would see domestic terrorists and violent rioters attacking police officers and the scourge of violent crime as a direct result of his own policies.""

The DHS added that it ""is setting the record straight about Pritzker’s lies and defending the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from his smears and slander.""

PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS

During a press conference Monday, Pritzker said there has been an ""unconstitutional invasion of Illinois by the federal government,"" and, ""For weeks now, Donald Trump, Kristi Noem, and [Commander at Large of the U.S. Border Patrol] Gregory Bovino have brought their militarized CBP and ICE agents to the streets of Chicago to cause violence and chaos in this city.""

However, the DHS said the ""reality"" is that, ""this is neither unconstitutional nor an invasion.""

""President Trump has the authority under the Constitution to deploy troops, wherever they’re stationed, to defend federal facilities from attacks,"" it added in response to Pritzker’s first claim on the list. ""Whether it’s the ICE facility in Broadview or the courthouse in Portland, we will defend federal property wherever they are under siege.""

In an appearance on CNN on Monday, Pritzker said, ""People are getting detained, they’re getting arrested: U.S. citizens. They did this when they raided a building in the middle of the night in South Shore [Chicago]. One hundred thirty people, they were emptied out of this building. They were going after a few gang members, and instead, they broke windows, they broke down doors, they ransacked the place... They are the ones that are making it a war zone.""

PRITZKER SAYS TRUMP ORDERING 400 MEMBERS OF THE TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD TO ILLINOIS, OREGON AND OTHER LOCATIONS

""Law enforcement conducted a targeted operation at an apartment building in the South Shore community of Chicago,"" DHS said in response. ""This operation, conducted by the CBP, the FBI, and the ATF, resulted in the arrest of 37 illegal aliens, from such countries as Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, and Nigeria. Among them were Tren de Aragua gang members and violent criminals.""

""DHS has routinely debunked the absurd claim that DHS is targeting U.S. citizens during ICE operations. ICE does not arrest or deport U.S. citizens. Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement,"" it also said.

Pritzker’s office did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

The Illinois governor said on Monday, ""On September 12, ICE shot and killed a man in Franklin Park, a nearby suburb of Chicago. His name was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez. Reports say that he had just dropped his kids off at a daycare and was headed to work.""

""Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez was an illegal alien who, when law enforcement ordered him to stop his car, instead drove his car at the officers. One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance. Fearing for his own life and broader public safety, the officer fired his weapon,"" according to DHS. ""Despite his injuries, the officer and his partner immediately started administering emergency medical care to the illegal alien, who was pronounced dead. Villegas-Gonzalez, who was the target of the operation, was a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving.""

Then Pritzker added, ""In the small suburban village of Broadview, with a population of 8,000, federal agents have turned two blocks of protest areas into a warzone by firing tear gas and chemical agents at peaceful protesters.""

""Rioters against DHS and other law enforcement in Illinois have been anything but peaceful. Over the weekend, Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles,"" Homeland Security said. ""One woman, Marimar Martinez, driving one of the vehicles, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxxing federal agents. She took defensive fire from CBP agents, has been discharged from the hospital, and is currently in the custody of the FBI. The driver of another vehicle, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in the ramming, has been apprehended by law enforcement.""

Pritzker also said Monday that, ""Peaceful protesters have been hit with tear gas and shot with rubber bullets. Journalists simply reporting the facts on the ground have been targeted and arrested. Us citizens, including children, have been traumatized and detained. This escalation of violence is targeted and intentional and premeditated. The Trump Administration is following a playbook, cause chaos, create fear and confusion.""

""The First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting. DHS is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers,"" DHS said in response. ""ICE officers are facing a nearly 1000% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members. We remind members of the media to exercise caution as they cover these violent riots and remind journalists that covering unlawful activities in the field does come with risks — though our officers take every reasonable precaution to mitigate those dangers to those exercising protected First Amendment rights.""

CHICAGO'S POLICE CHIEF PUTS CRIMINALS ON NOTICE AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS TARGETED IN WEEKEND CONFRONTATIONS

During his CNN interview with host Jake Tapper, Pritzker also said, ""They’re raiding neighborhoods, where, instead of going after the bad guys, they’re just picking up people who are brown and [B]lack and then checking their credentials.""

""Since Operation Midway Blitz began in Illinois last month, ICE and CBP officers have arrested more than 1,000 illegal aliens — including the worst of the worst pedophiles, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers,"" DHS said. ""We have also arrested multiple members of the gang Tren de Aragua, and illegal aliens with criminal histories that include drug trafficking, child rape, and murder, among other violent convictions. Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.""

And lastly, Pritzker said, ""There were people who were held, elderly people, and children zip-tied, elderly people held for three hours at a time,"" during the South Shore operation.

""The claim that a toddler was zip-tied originated from a screenshot that went viral, with the original poster claiming it showed an ICE officer zip-tying a child.

Adopted in October 2000, Resolution 1325 established that women should be full, safe, equal, and meaningful participants in all discussions about their country’s future, including peace talks. Resolution 1325 has never been more important than it is today, as we face a global backlash against women’s rights and escalating wars and crises around the globe.

And yet, we are seeing a dangerous erosion of the basic principle 1325 stands for.

Women still have to fight for a seat at the tables where key discussions take place; the UN itself sometimes excludes women.

In 2020, then-UN undersecretary general Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka described 1325 as “one of the crowning achievements of the global women’s movement and one of the most inspired decisions of the United Nations Security Council.” But the Security Council members that unanimously adopted the resolution 25 years ago have often failed to uphold 1325. And the number of women’s rights defenders briefing the council has fallen dramatically, a trend worsened by the US immigration crackdown, which has blocked many potential speakers from traveling safely to New York, where the council meets.

Resolution 1325 has been stress-tested over the last 25 years. Subsequent resolutions detailed what full participation by women means, and how countries and multilateral bodies should ensure women’s participation and respond to gendered impacts of conflict. Well over 100 countries developed national action plans for how they would implement Resolution 1325.

All this effort helped prove what women in war zones already knew: women’s participation makes a difference. One comprehensive study found that when women are involved in peace negotiations, those processes are more likely to lead to agreement, and agreements are more likely to be implemented. In its 20 year review of Resolution 1325, UN Women wrote that research “comprehensively demonstrates that the participation of women at all levels is key to the operational effectiveness, success and sustainability of peace processes and peacebuilding efforts.”

Pritzker challenged Abbott's backing of the move.

Immigration facility remains open amid legal challenges The contradiction raises questions about who actually has authority over detainees there and whether due process is being followed.","(NewsNation) — Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice say many detainees held at the Florida immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” have never been in removal proceedings, directly contradicting what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been saying since it opened in July.

Attorneys for the DOJ argued Thursday in a court filing that the detainees at the facility in the Everglades are housed with immigration detainees “in all stages” of the process, and they don’t have enough in common to be certified as a class in a lawsuit over whether they’re getting proper access to attorneys.

A removal proceeding is a legal process initiated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to determine if someone should be deported from the United States.

That directly contradicts DeSantis, who has repeatedly claimed that everyone at the facility is already under a final order to be deported.

Detainees denied proper legal access: DOJ attorneys

The DOJ attorneys argue that detainees at the facility are being denied access to their attorneys. They also wrote that the detainees have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.

“The proposed class includes all detainees at Alligator Alcatraz, a facility that houses detainees in all stages of immigration processing — presumably including those who have never been in removal proceedings, those who will be placed into removal proceedings, those who are already subject to final orders of removal, those subject to expedited removal, and those detained for the purpose of facilitation removal from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal,” they wrote.

Since the facility opened, DeSantis has been publicly stating that each detainee has undergone a process to determine that they can’t legally be in the United States.

“I can tell you, DHS is sending people who they absolutely believe are here illegally and subject to deportation,” DeSantis said during a July 25 news conference. “Everybody here is already on a final removal order. They have been ordered to be removed from the country.”

At a July 29 speech before a conference of the Florida Sheriffs Association, DeSantis said, “The people that are going to the Alligator Alcatraz are illegally in the country. They’ve all already been given a final order of removal.”

So far, DeSantis’ office has not responded to the DOJ’s statements.

Immigration facility remains open amid legal challenges

The contradiction raises questions about who actually has authority over detainees there and whether due process is being followed.

The court filing by DOJ attorneys was made in a lawsuit in which civil rights groups allege that the facility’s detainees have been denied proper access to attorneys, in violation of their constitutional rights. The civil rights groups on Thursday asked a federal judge in Fort Myers for a preliminary injunction that would establish stronger protections for detainees to meet with attorneys privately and share documents confidentially.

The court case is one of three lawsuits filed by environmental and civil rights groups over the detention center, which was hastily built this summer by the state of Florida and operated by private contractors and state agencies.

A federal judge in Miami ordered the facility to wind down operations in August, citing environmental issues with the Everglades site. But weeks later, a different judge’s panel put that on hold, allowing the detention center to stay open while the legal fight continues.

At one point, the facility held more than 900 detainees, but most of them were transferred after the initial injunction. It wasn’t clear on Monday how many detainees were at the center, which was built to hold 3,000 people.

Meanwhile, the number of ICE detainees with a prior criminal conviction (15,725) is now smaller than the number without any criminal record.
This is the “first time” that’s “EVER” happened, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.
To substantiate his claim, Reichlin-Melnick charted the fluctuations in ICE’s detention population since May 2019, which is as far back as the data goes.
One reason is that the administration has set a new quota of 3,000 ICE arrests per day, up from 1,000 previously.","President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other top Trump administration officials have long claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would spend Trump’s second term prioritizing “the worst of the worst” for deportation: not necessarily immigrants who came to (or stayed in) America without authorization, but rather those who have committed serious crimes since arriving here.

Now, nine months after Trump returned to the Oval Office, new government data suggests that ICE is no longer following that playbook.

According to the agency’s own Sept. 25 custody report, the largest group of immigrants arrested in the interior and currently detained by ICE (16,523) are people with no criminal record at all. (To be clear, being present in the U.S. unlawfully is a civil immigration law violation punishable by deportation — not a federal crime punishable by jail.)

Meanwhile, the number of ICE detainees with a prior criminal conviction (15,725) is now smaller than the number without any criminal record. The same goes for the share who face pending criminal charges (13,767).

This is the “first time” that’s “EVER” happened, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. To substantiate his claim, Reichlin-Melnick charted the fluctuations in ICE’s detention population since May 2019, which is as far back as the data goes. Here’s what that chart looks like:

The orange line represents detainees with no criminal record. After remaining relatively low and flat for years, it effectively goes vertical at the start of 2025, a period coinciding with Trump’s return to office — and shoots up so quickly and suddenly that it now surpasses the two other categories of detainees.

ICE is “raiding neighborhoods, where, instead of going after the bad guys, they're just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials: Are you a U.S. citizen?” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, claimed on Monday. “They need to get out of Chicago if they're not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they were going to do.”

Who Trump said he would deport

Pritzer’s comments came days after Border Patrol agents in Chicago surrounded a five-story apartment building in Chicago’s largely Black South Shore neighborhood, then reportedly “rappelled” from helicopters and went door to door, rousing residents — including children — and using zip ties to restrain them.

“They was terrified,” one resident told the local ABC affiliate. “The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other.”

The Department of Homeland Security said that it arrested 37 individuals during the operation, all of whom were “involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes and immigration violators.”

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pledged to launch “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” adding elsewhere that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” — a statement widely criticized as racist — and coming to the U.S. from “mental institutions.”

His inspiration, he said, was the “Eisenhower model” — a reference to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s 1954 campaign, known by the ethnic slur “Operation Wetback,” to round up and expel Mexican immigrants in what amounted to a nationwide “show me your papers” rule.

But when experts questioned how Trump would actually deport all of the estimated 14 million unauthorized immigrants residing in the U.S., the candidate and his allies claimed that they would prioritize “criminals” — much like previous administrations.

“We will start by prioritizing the most dangerous criminals,” read the platform adopted at the 2024 Republican National Convention.

“Let's start with the first million who are the most violent criminals, who are the most aggressive,” Vance added at a Pennsylvanian campaign stop. “Get them out of here. First prioritize them, and then you see where you are, and you keep on taking bites of the problem, until you get illegal immigration to a serviceable point.""

Who ICE is targeting — and why

The latest ICE data shows that the agency is still arresting and detaining people with criminal records or pending charges; their ranks have also swelled as immigration enforcement has intensified under Trump, and the Department of Homeland Security frequently puts out press releases publicizing the capture of “heinous criminals.”

In July, Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, called the assessment that ICE isn’t targeting immigrants with a criminal record “false,” telling the Associated Press that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had directed ICE “to target the worst of the worst — including gang members, murderers and rapists.”

Yet since then, noncriminal arrests and detentions have risen at a much greater rate than criminal arrests and detentions. All told, less than 10% of people booked into ICE custody since last October have been convicted of “serious violent or sexual crimes,” according to CNN. A majority do not have any prior criminal convictions at all.

Why? One reason is that the administration has set a new quota of 3,000 ICE arrests per day, up from 1,000 previously. Another is that apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border — which were already falling under former President Joe Biden — have plummeted to their lowest level in decades since Trump took office, leaving agents with fewer easy, newly arrived targets for removal.

Enforcement priorities seem to have shifted as a result. Frustrated by ICE’s initial failure to meet its new deportation quotas, top White House aide Stephen Miller — the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda — held a testy meeting in May at agency headquarters, where he demanded that officers do “what they needed to do” to make more arrests — including rounding up noncriminals in public places, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Miller told agents they “didn’t need to develop target lists of immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, a longstanding practice,” the Journal reported. “Instead, he directed them to target Home Depot, where day laborers typically gather for hire, or 7-Eleven convenience stores. Miller bet that he and a handful of agents could go out on the streets of Washington, D.C., and arrest 30 people right away.”

The real people who have been affected

For the past few months, ICE has been conducting mass raids in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere to meet its quotas. The agency has also been arresting people when they check in at immigration court and enforcing decades-old deportation orders.

On Wednesday, the Texas Tribune reported on the case of Sergio Garcia, a well-known Waco, Texas, chef and restaurateur who entered the U.S. in 1989; overstayed his visa, became a favorite of the White House press corps under President George W. Bush, and eventually “spent more than 25 years trying to obtain legal status, hiring immigration attorneys in Austin, Houston, San Antonio and Florida.”

In March, ICE arrested and deported Garcia, separating him from his wife and his four U.S.-born adult children — and citing a two-decade-old deportation order that other agents had never attempted to enforce.

“Deportations like Sergio’s — to fixtures of the community — are making people think, ‘This could be me next, or my favorite place next, or somebody who I talk to every day,’” Mito Diaz-Espinoza, president of the Cen-Tex Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told the Tribune. “The protection of ‘Just do the right thing, put your head down, work hard, don’t get caught drunk driving’ — that’s no longer a safety net. That’s no longer going to protect you.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YsBCyPuSj_rZImozK4io2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/84874a60-a377-11f0-a7ff-a63faf559a91,N,,2025-10-08 08:56:24.867028

The proposed changes seek to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities.
The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass on a 3-0 vote, with two members abstaining.
“These amendments are intended to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on voluntary Providence Police Department cooperation in federal immigration enforcement,” said Providence City Council Chief of Staff June Rose in testimony before the committee.
Well over 100 people packed the Providence City Council Chamber, and dozens spoke in favor of the ordinance.","On Monday, the Providence City Council Committee on Ordinances approved an ordinance amending the Community Safety Act (officially known as the Community-Police Relations Act, but referred to as the CSA in this piece) to strengthen protections for city residents. The proposed changes seek to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities. The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass on a 3-0 vote, with two members abstaining.

The proposed changes come as Providence residents demand greater accountability following several concerning incidents this summer involving the Police Department. In one such incident, PPD officers were found to have assisted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel performing a raid in the city as part of President Donald Trump’s dangerous and racist crackdown on undocumented Americans.

“These amendments are intended to better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on voluntary Providence Police Department cooperation in federal immigration enforcement,” said Providence City Council Chief of Staff June Rose in testimony before the committee. “In Providence. Such cooperation is already unlawful.”

Upon passage, continued Rose, “the CSA barred the police department from collaborating with federal immigration authorities, absent a judicial warrant. The CSA states that Providence Police are not permitted to comply with requests by other agencies to support or assist in operations conducted solely to enforce federal and civil immigration law, including, but not limited to, requests to establish traffic perimeters related solely to immigration enforcement. The police department’s internal policy mirrors this language.

“This policy was recently tested in a widely circulated video of the July 13th Alberton Avenue incident,” noted Rose. “Viewers watched as Providence police officers provided assistance to ICE in what PERA, the independent board charged with oversight of the department, found was operationally significant. Critically, this was during an exclusively immigration enforcement action where ICE officers were operating without a judicial warrant. Counselors have argued that the incident exposed gaps in the CSA’s protections by showing how Providence Police could still, in practice, provide indirect assistance to federal immigration enforcement.”

The proposed changes fall into five major categories:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not usually tasked with immigration, which the Trump administration has recently deputized to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant accompanies those directives. The proposed CSA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CSA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces gives families, especially youth, more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies, such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all the restrictions outlined in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement, absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow specific non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CSA violations by the Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

Read the full draft of the proposed changes here.

Well over 100 people packed the Providence City Council Chamber, and dozens spoke in favor of the ordinance. Only one person, Allen Waters, who has declared his candidacy for Mayor of Providence, spoke against the ordinance, and in a classy move, dropped an ethnic slur while doing so.

Testimony was heard for three hours. Here’s the video:

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do.","THREE OF THE FOUR California counties empowered to inspect federal immigration detention facilities have not done so, and the fourth has conducted only basic reviews of food this year, records obtained by CalMatters show.

If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants.

Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities.

The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues. The AG’s office has used that power to publish annual reports on conditions inside detention centers, including one this year that alleged deficient mental health care.

The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities.

In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.

The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.

More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were 3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report.

Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor.

CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mojave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield.

A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter.

“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.

She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters.

Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.

Counties reviewing inspection law

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service.

Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections.

The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”

California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.

ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center.

MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City.

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary.

As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles.

It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature.

GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.

“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.”

“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

Adelanto cleared county review

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports.

San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows.

“Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.

Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.

Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.

An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility.

During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.

“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”

A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care.

“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity. Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”

California tried to ban for-profit detention

The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility.

State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.

Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional.

Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do. The authority rests more with the federal government, particularly Congress,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LNM-20250930-MATTERSINSPECT-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-08 03:56:32.430341

The temporary restraining order is scheduled to expire on Oct. 18.","A federal judge over the weekend issued a temporary restraining order requiring immigration officials to get rid of guards monitoring a man who suffered a broken leg during a car wash raid by federal agents in Carson more than a month ago.

U.S. District Judge Cynthia Valenzuela, according to the L.A. Times, also ordered that handcuffs shackling Bayron Rovidio Marin to the bed in Harbor-UCLA Medical Center be removed.

Rovidio Marin had reportedly been under constant surveillance, unable to speak privately with doctors or legal counsel, since he was swept up and seriously injured when a “roving patrol” of Border Patrol agents raided the carwash and later transferred him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, The Times reported.

“He is presently detained under restrictions that limit his access to counsel, medical providers, and family,” the judge wrote in her Oct. 4 order. “He has been questioned by government officials while in pain and under the influence of medication. He cannot place phone calls and remains handcuffed to a hospital bed despite a broken leg that prevents him from walking.”

So far, ICE has yet to charge Rovidio Marin with violating immigration laws, set bond, issue a Notice to Appear or process him for removal proceedings.

In her temporary restraining order, Judge Valenzuela wrote that the government had failed to prove that the man had “violated any law or regulation” or shown that he was a “flight risk.”

U.S. immigration attorneys told the court that Rovidio Marin’s immigration status would be determined once he was released from the hospital, though attorneys for the man argued that his detainment for 37 days without charges is a violation of the U.S. Constitution.

Federal law requires the government to provide a person arrested without a warrant with a reason for their detainment within two days, a regulation only waived under extraordinary circumstances.

Judge Valenzuela referenced the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as “extraordinary circumstances” in delaying due process for noncitizen detainees and said that Rovidio Marin had been held “substantially longer.”

“For 37 days, our client was forced to endure medical treatment and recovery with ICE agents in his room, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Cynthia Santiago, Attorney for CLEAN Carwash Worker Center and Nicolas Thompson-Llera, Attorney for CHIRLA said in a statement obtained by The Times. “ICE agents listened to every conversation between him and his doctors,” they stated. “They interrogated him while he was in pain and under the influence of medication. They did not permit him to see his family and removed his access to phone calls.”

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on the case and is awaiting a response.

""And that's a result over years of failures in policies by the prior administration to allow so many illegal aliens and so much criminal activity to occur here in Chicago, in the state of Illinois.""

While immigration enforcement isn’t a typical part of the FBI’s job, Patel said that ""every single three-letter agency"" in the Trump administration is ""driving towards the same mission."" He called the concerted campaign a ""whole-of-government approach.""

And Patel added that the mission goes well beyond immigration enforcement, also touching on narcotics distribution, government officials who are suddenly being targeted for death and agents whose lives are being endangered.

Patel lauded the efforts of the officers serving with the Chicago Police Dept., calling them ""great partners"" and saying ""they are doing their job with us every single day.""He drew a stark contrast, however, between the rank-and-file and their bosses.""

President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops to protect federal officials and property in Chicago has already been kicked to the courts.

But Blanche said it’s clear that the Guard is needed to help clean up the high-crime streets of Chicago.

""I mean, at this point, it's almost laughable, laughable that the state government is standing up and saying, don't let the National Guard in,"" Blanche said. ""I mean, they have access to the same TV that I have access to. And of course, we need the National Guard.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/kash-patel-chicago-trip-fox-news-001.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 02:56:50.188635

(WGN) – A 23-year-old U.S. citizen was arrested and released in Waukegan Monday as federal agents ramp up immigration arrests in Lake County.

The news comes amid accusations of heavy-handed policing and community leaders are calling it un-American.

“I didn’t resist. I complied and everything and they shoved me into the car,” Lake County resident Dariana Fajardo, who was arrested and released in Waukegan on Monday, said. “It was very scary, but there’s people who have been through a lot worse.”

In a written statement, Department of Homeland Security spokespeople said federal agents took action after Dariana, who was driving her car, allegedly tried to box in ICE vehicles. Dariana denied those accusations.

“He was telling me to get in and how can I get in if you’re shoving me into the seat,” Dariana said.

Waukegan Mayor Sam Cunningham tried to come to Dariana’s aid as well, to no avail.

“We’re in uncharted territory right now. It’s not what we think is right. It’s what they think is right,” Cunningham said.

Dariana’s family and other community leaders said the arrest was unwarranted.

“Clearly she had her passport with her. They didn’t even grab that. They threw it in the car, left it behind,” Dariana’s cousin Sandra Fajardo said.

U.S. Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Illinois) criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Schneider and other community leaders went to Waukegan’s Veterans Memorial Plaza to protest.

ICE’s social media surveillance plans

Republicans love to peddle debunked conspiracy theories about spooky government targeting of conservatives online. Now, the same right-wing movement that brought you the “Twitter Files” conspiracy theory is standing idly by as the government reportedly assembles a social media surveillance apparatus to aid President Donald Trump’s bigoted mass incarceration and deportation agenda.

Wired magazine was the first to report on publicly available contracting records showing that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking contractors to potentially run an around-the-clock social media surveillance program out of two offices, located in Vermont and California.

Per the report:

Federal contracting records reviewed by WIRED show that the agency is seeking private vendors to run a multiyear surveillance program out of two of its little-known targeting centers. The program envisions stationing nearly 30 private analysts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Vermont and Southern California. Their job: Scour Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms, converting posts and profiles into fresh leads for enforcement raids.

The proposal is still at an early stage and has not been finalized. But along with Trump’s open threats against the left — such as his concrete steps urging the Department of Homeland Security to target liberals and the military to vanquish the “enemy within” — this proposal raises the possibility of a tool that could be used to spy on the administration’s supposed enemies or suppress free speech.

Trump demands gratitude for TikTok

Trump claimed in a social media post that young people “owe me big” for having “saved TikTok.” And by “saved TikTok,” he means his administration defied a bipartisan law ordering the app to be sold earlier this year — and greenlit a deal to hand the app’s U.S. operation to an ownership group including Larry Ellison, the uber-rich Trump ally who has openly promoted his vision of mass surveillance.

AI-assisted group attacks Wes Moore

A new report shines light on a mysterious group that has targeted Maryland’s first Black governor, Wes Moore, with artificial intelligence-generated videos on social media that have been denounced as racist by Democratic leaders. The dark money group calls itself No Moore.

Ahead of Noem’s arrival Tuesday, about two dozen demonstrators waited outside the ICE facility playing music and holding signs.
They argued that sending troops to Portland would cause irreparable harm, including financial harm, by inciting greater protests than would exist without the federal troops.
After that meal, Noem was spotted on the roof of the ICE facility looking out at the small group of protestors and press.
“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon,” Kotek said.","As Oregon awaits more clarity from a federal appeals court on the Trump administration’s attempts to deploy National Guard troops from multiple states to Portland, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem traveled to the city’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Tuesday.

The ICE processing facility in south Portland has been the center of mostly small protests for months. Ahead of Noem’s arrival Tuesday, about two dozen demonstrators waited outside the ICE facility playing music and holding signs. About an hour before Noem’s arrival, federal police took down protest signs that had been affixed to nearby walls and fences for weeks.

Oregon Guard and combat veteran Noah Mrowczynski was among the small group of protestors. Mrowczynski, 45, hadn’t been to the facility before but said he wanted to join the protest when he heard Noem was coming.

“I’m a combat veteran, a veteran who fought real wars against real terrorists,” he said. “Not this so-called insurrection and so-called terrorists Trump would have you believe we are in Portland.”

Federal District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term, blocked Trump from mobilizing 200 Oregon National Guard troops on Saturday. On Sunday, she issued a broader order blocking troops from anywhere in the U.S. from coming to Portland after the administration began sending federalized troops from California and called up 400 Texas National Guard members to federal service.

On Tuesday, Gov. Tina Kotek sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Northern Command, which is overseeing Oregon and California troops, urging him to immediately send home the 200 Oregon soldiers stationed at Camp Rilea in Warrenton and the 200 California soldiers stationed at Camp Withycombe in Happy Valley.

“Our citizen soldiers deserve better than to be uprooted from their families and careers, only to be mobilized for an illegal mission positioning our soldiers in opposition to the U.S. Constitution’s 1st, 4th and 10th amendments, of which they have taken an oath to uphold,” Kotek wrote.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals set oral arguments for Thursday morning on the federal government’s request to stay Immergut’s ruling. Without a stay, a restraining order will continue to block troops from being deployed until mid-October, when Immergut will decide whether to renew the order. She set a trial on the merits of the state’s case for the end of the month.

Attorneys for Oregon, the city of Portland and now California have argued that deploying federalized troops violates the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees that police power within the states resides with the states. They argued that sending troops to Portland would cause irreparable harm, including financial harm, by inciting greater protests than would exist without the federal troops.

Immergut agreed, saying in her Saturday ruling that there was no evidence of a rebellion or danger of a rebellion in Portland protests.

“Furthermore, this country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote. “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law. Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Noem visits

Federal agents pushed protesters and local reporters back from the ICE facility before Noem arrived, but a handful of conservative influencers — including one arrested for fighting outside the ICE facility last week — accompanied her. One posted a video on X showing Noem praying over a meal from Burgerville, the Vancouver-based regional fast food chain.

After that meal, Noem was spotted on the roof of the ICE facility looking out at the small group of protestors and press.

Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement Tuesday that she met Noem at the airport Tuesday after hearing through unofficial channels that she might visit. Kotek said she told Noem that Oregon is united in opposition to military policing in communities.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon,” Kotek said. “Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland. I was clear that I have confidence in local law enforcement to meet the moment.”

Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, was harsher in his statement.

“Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official,” Wyden. “In reality, she’s been sent by Trump to incite violence.”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2008-2048x1361.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 04:57:44.121425

The new protest hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, according to the executive order, which cites public safety concerns.
The fixed protest hours could bring into question first amendment infringement.
American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka said the organization hopes “no one limits free speech,” and he said the ACLU will monitor how the protest hours will be enforced.
A business next door to the ICE facility last week placed wooden barricades outside its building in an effort to keep protesters — and clashes between them and ICE agents — off its property.","Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson signed an executive order Monday setting designated protest times outside a federal facility used to process detained immigrants in the west suburb.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center at 1930 Beach Street has become a hotbed for protests since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up his deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.” Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m., and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.

The new protest hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, according to the executive order, which cites public safety concerns. The executive order is in effect immediately and will be until it is “deemed no longer necessary to protect residents’ health, safety, and welfare.”

Protesters have sometimes been met with federal agents spraying tear gas, pepper spray and shooting various forms of rubber pellets.

“People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,” Thompson said in a statement.

The fixed protest hours could bring into question first amendment infringement. The Village of Broadview’s curfew is 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and midnight Fridays and Saturdays.

American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka said the organization hopes “no one limits free speech,” and he said the ACLU will monitor how the protest hours will be enforced.

He cast blame for the fixed hours on the “increasingly militarized tactics and behavior of ICE and other federal officers.”

“These officers have turned dangerous weapons on protesters, fired projectiles indiscriminately and used chemical agents against protesters and journalists,” Yohnka said. “The solution to this situation is for ICE and the Trump administration to end the escalation of these tactics both at Broadview and when doing civil immigration enforcement in neighborhoods across the area.”

In a statement, the Chicago Activist Coalition for Justice said it “heavily disagree[s]” with the designated protest time.

“It secretly silences our voices to be heard,” Rabbi Michael Ben Yosef, leader of the coalition, said in a statement. “This executive order by the mayor is a win for the Trump administration who rejects our presence as activists for human rights.”

Last week, the Illinois State Police stepped in to control protest crowds and erected concrete barriers to form “designated protest areas” outside the facility’s main entrance on Beach Street and near another entrance on 25th Avenue.

Protesters marched down 25th Avenue Saturday night and tried entering Interstate 290, causing state police to temporarily block the interstate exit, while 25th Avenue was closed to traffic between Lexington Street and Roosevelt Road for most of the protest.

In another recent instance, federal agents in military dress chased two protesters across traffic on 25th Avenue and into a nearby resident’s yard, breaking a piece of their fence while shooting rubber baton rounds. One federal agent appeared to injure himself during the chase and was helped back across the street by another agent, who pointed a Taser at motorists, protesters and journalists as they made their way back to the ICE facility.

A business next door to the ICE facility last week placed wooden barricades outside its building in an effort to keep protesters — and clashes between them and ICE agents — off its property.

The Village of Broadview last week filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE, citing serious public safety concerns over an 8-foot fence erected outside the immigration facility’s Beach Street entrance last month.

Thompson has spoken out in recent weeks against federal agents’ use of chemical agents against protesters outside the facility, which is tucked into an industrial corridor, with residential homes lining the 25th Avenue entrance. She previously called on Russell Hott, director of the ICE Chicago field office, to stop “making war on my community,” saying the “relentless deployment” of chemical agents and rubber bullets endanger nearby residents and first responders.

“The residents, our business[es], all of the visitors — we’re responsible for them,” Thompson said in a recent interview with WBEZ. “We’re responsible for the protesters, their well-being, their safety. We are responsible for the journalists that come to our town.”

In her statement Monday, Thompson said she supports the protesters’ First Amendment rights, but she emphasized the need to balance those rights with public safety.

“I support their [protesters] cause. But the repeated clashes with ICE agents in our town are causing enormous disruptions in the quality of life for my residents whose rights I have taken an oath to protect. We live here. Our residents live here and deserve dignity and respect,” Thompson said.

However, her freedom remains at risk as the government continues to challenge the ruling that vindicated her constitutional rights. It’s a case with sweeping implications for thousands of immigrants who end up detained in Louisiana’s sprawling detention system.

Kostak, a 50-year-old Ukrainian woman, has been living in Brooklyn, New York for nearly two decades after fleeing Ukraine for political reasons in 2005. She became a pillar of her neighborhood and a beloved community member. On June 26, 2025, she attended a routine court appointment for her asylum case and was abruptly seized and arrested by federal authorities without warning. She was then transported more than 1,000 miles away from her home and husband to Monroe, Louisiana.

Kostak is one of millions of immigrants actively targeted by the current administration’s sweeping initiative to incarcerate as many immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they have a criminal background. Her petition became one of the first to establish that immigrants who have spent decades in this country are entitled to make their case for release. When Kostak did so, an immigration court granted her a federal-court-ordered bond hearing. It concluded that she was not a danger or a flight risk and therefore should be released from immigration detention.

Despite this clear judicial ruling, the government blatantly ignored the court’s decision and kept Kostak locked away. She has been released, but the threat of re-arrest and incarceration remains.

Her fear of re-arrest is palpable because the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is being asked to vacate her bond so she can be put behind bars once again. Her case illustrates this administration’s desire to subject all immigrants to mandatory detention, and render them ineligible for bond, no matter how long they have lived, worked, and paid taxes in this country, and regardless of whether they have ever committed a single crime.

“Larysa never should have been detained in the first place,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director for the ACLU of Louisiana. “And she shouldn’t have had to go to court for a bond hearing to which she was entitled. She’s now stuck in a limbo of fear and confusion as she could be re-arrested all over again because of the administration’s attempt to overrule the Constitution by virtue of its control over the administrative agency that reports to it: the BIA. ”

“ICE officers detained Larysa at her court hearing without notice or warning, then subjected her to unnecessary and unlawful detention over a thousand miles from her home,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at RFK Human Rights. “Even though she’s now been released, she remains in legal limbo and is fearful of being re-detained for no other reason than the Trump administration thinks they can. Her story is emblematic of the Trump administration’s blatant attempts to bypass Constitutional rights and expand mandatory immigration detention – no matter the circumstances and no matter the cost.”

Others have already been subjected to prolonged lockup with no end in sight. Carlos Raul Ventura Martinez, another ACLU of Louisiana client, lived in Maryland for 12 years and is now detained. He has a wife and three children there and has no criminal record.

Like Kostak, Mr. Ventura Martinez, was arrested in Maryland and detained in Louisiana. He too was granted bond by an immigration judge, only to see the BIA vacate his bond determination based on sham precedent that violates constitutional law. Kostak is terrified the same fate is likely to befall her and will lead to her re-arrest.

The Trump administration’s vendetta against unaccompanied immigrant children continued last week with a new scheme to pay children $2,500 to “voluntarily” give up their legal rights and return to their home country. It’s a disingenuous and dangerous form of coercion that risks the lives and well-being of vulnerable children and youth.

Initial reports from advocates suggested that the Department of Homeland Security would transmit letters to unaccompanied minors ages 14 to 17 currently in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), offering them money to withdraw their legal claims and ask for “voluntary departure.”

As part of the operation, supposedly dubbed “Freaky Friday,” children who declined the offer would be ineligible for release to a sponsor—staying in custody for the duration of their cases—and could endanger their parents’ immigration status as well. Other reports suggested that the plan could be extended to children as young as 10 and to children already residing in communities.

It appears, for now at least, that the scheme is more limited, but no less insidious.

Piecing together various ICE statements and social media posts, as well as messages sent to shelter care providers and legal service providers, the current plan appears to offer children ages 14 to 17 who have expressed an interest in voluntarily returning and are in ORR custody a “resettlement stipend” of $2,500. ORR care providers are instructed to facilitate a meeting between the child, legal service providers and ICE.

If the child “agrees to the stipend,” ICE will generate a form for signature and submit it to the immigration judge. ORR care providers may be required to provide available contact information for parents or other responsible adult contacts in the home country.

Discharge from ORR custody will take place only after an immigration judge approves the withdrawal. The child will receive the funds only after returning to the home country.

ICE maintains that the stipend is part of its new initiative to offer unaccompanied children a “voluntary option [which] gives [them] a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.”

But voluntary departure, under strict rules designed to ensure a child’s decision is informed and in their best interests, already exists. Legal service providers and child advocates, as well as immigration judges, take pains to explain to children all options and to explore with them, often in consultation with family members, how they wish to proceed.

In other words, the child already has a choice about whether to remain in the United States to seek protection; the government is trying to stack the deck by putting what might be an irresistible incentive in front of kids who opt for voluntary departure.

Given that many children may not yet have an attorney and haven’t been to immigration court, it appears the government may also be counting on an accelerated process to secure the child’s agreement without having the time to fully consult with an attorney or for child advocates to conduct the necessary home studies required to ensure that the child will be able to safely return to their country.

It appears that the government will initiate the request for voluntary departure on behalf of the child—hoping perhaps that the child’s signature will convince the immigration judge to approve the transaction on paper, no questions asked.

Let’s hope immigration judges don’t take the document at face value. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 is designed to protect children not only from the threat of trafficking and other harms but from the kind of manipulation evident here. The TVPRA recognizes the unique vulnerabilities of children, consequently authorizing legal services, modified procedures for applying for asylum and other protections, as well as the appointment of child advocates for particularly vulnerable children, including those who are considering self-deportation.

… ensuring that every child can return home safely should be the norm—not a reward for increasing the government’s deportation numbers.

The TVPRA also forbids the government from returning a child, whether through voluntary departure or a removal order, without first ensuring that the child can be safely repatriated. Child advocates conduct assessments regarding the child’s best interests, family and living situation, and the safety risks that will assist the immigration judge in determining whether voluntary departure is appropriate.

Given these protections, I suspect many immigration judges will raise the following questions:

Does an agreement to accept the stipend equal informed consent? The government does not, in its explanation of the program, describe the child’s agreement to forgo their legal rights and withdraw any efforts to stay in the United States. Instead, the emphasis is on the child’s agreement to take the money. Rather than “helping” the child, it appears the government is attempting to bribe them to give up their legal rights.

How old is the child? With whom did they consult? Did the child have adequate time to discuss the decision with attorneys and with a child advocate appointed by ORR? (Under current policy guidelines, any child seeking voluntary return is assigned a child advocate.) Has that child advocate conducted a home study and made a recommendation to the court regarding the best interests of the child?

If this stipend is designed to help the child, why is it limited to children who ask to voluntarily return home? A child who applies for asylum but is denied needs the support to return home every bit as much as a child who decides to withdraw earlier in the process. If the government is truly interested in protecting children, ensuring that every child can return home safely should be the norm—not a reward for increasing the government’s deportation numbers.

Nor is the $2,500 the only evidence that the government is trying to coerce children into forgoing their rights. Many children have been pressured by CBP agents at the border to agree to voluntary departure—with absolutely no legal counsel or other advice.

Twenty-three children’s advocacy groups recently objected to ICE agents conducting interviews with older teenagers in ORR custody, sometimes without counsel present, asking them whether they are interested in returning to their home country. Children in custody are aware of the failed Labor Day effort to deport Guatemalan minors; anxiety over whether the government might force them to return home runs high.

And on Oct. 1, just days before this $2,500 gambit started, ICE issued guidance ordering that all children in custody who turn 18 must be turned over to adult detention. Because ORR only has custody over unaccompanied children until they turn 18, the urgency of finding an appropriate placement increases as the child nears their 18th birthday.

In the past, most children never faced this dilemma because ORR quickly placed them with sponsors. The administration’s current sponsor eligibility requirements have become so onerous, however, that children are averaging six months in custody, placing more of them at risk of aging out before an appropriate sponsor or other living situation can be found.

Incredibly, the first Trump administration had already tried and failed to force all 18 year olds into adult custody—and the resulting order in Garcia Ramirez, et al requiring ICE to place 18 year olds transferred from ORR into the least restrictive custody setting available is still in effect.

Although advocates immediately obtained a temporary injunction against Adult Detention, Round 2, the Trump administration is not likely to let the matter drop because the messaging is more important than the actual outcome.

The Trump administration practices incremental intimidation.

If children are told at the border that they should consider returning home, if they are prevented from reuniting with their families in the United States, and if they hear that they might stay in custody the whole time they are in the U.S., despair will inevitably follow.

If children think about the friends in their shelters who were pulled from their beds in the middle of the night, if they can’t talk to attorneys and other adults who want to help them, and if they learn that they might end up in an adult jail, voluntary departure might start sounding better and better.

It’s called detention fatigue, and children are highly susceptible to it. The government is cynically counting on the $2,500 to push that fatigue into resignation. After all, is it really giving up if you are coming home with cash in hand?

My money, however, is on the children. Despite the “give up and give in” earworm playing almost daily, the children who risked everything to come to the United States are a resilient and brave group of people. Some of them have already said “no,” and pushed back when the government tried to deport them in the middle of the night. Many of them know that they cannot return home safely and that their only hope is in pursuing their claims. And many of them know that the people who love them do not want them to return to the horrible conditions they fled.

If this administration really cared about unaccompanied children, it would stop coercing them and start listening to them. Because clearly, the Trump administration has a lot to learn if they think these tenacious kids will simply go away.",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charly-Triballeau.png,N,,2025-10-07 22:57:18.647478

The move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.

After the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”

The Latest:

The Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.

In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.

The directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.

Laiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.

Several House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.

Five U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations.

The lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.

A former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.

Margolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.

Margolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.

Six former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.

The former public officials — appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush — warned that Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, autism and other issues have undermined the public health system and amplified health misinformation instead of combating it.

An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.

“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.

Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.

Noem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Also known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.

Leavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”

Trump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Trump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.

Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.

Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.

Once she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

A judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”

The ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”

A federal grand jury in Atlanta has indicted two men after authorities said they made online threats against an ICE officer and his wife.

Frank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.

Noto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.

Waszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.

National Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.

Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.

There were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.

The latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.

During September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.

As Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.

The investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.

“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.

Bondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.

“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.

“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.

It was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.

The Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.

Most justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.

Justice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”

The city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.

The city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”

Her trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.

A federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.

The president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”

But, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”

When asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”

“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.

A meeting between the two leaders has not been formally announced.

The president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.

But asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.

He offered no further details.

The president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”

“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”

Asked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”

But asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.

The Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”

Carney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”

“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”

During a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.

“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.

The attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.

The president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”

“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.

The president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.

He also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”

Trump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.

“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”

The City of Chicago and state of Illinois sued Trump on Monday, seeking to stop the sending of National Guard troops to Chicago. The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

Johnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”

“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”

“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.

“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”

Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”

A federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.

(WRIC) — While President Donald Trump’s order ending automatic citizenship for the children of people in the country illegally or temporarily is headed to the Supreme Court, immigrant advocates say one Virginia leader has been silent.

The Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights (VACIR) is asking Attorney General Jason Miyares to join the nationwide lawsuits blocking the executive order.

“The U.S. constitution has always been clear on this issue,” said Kim Leung with the Asian Law Caucus on Tuesday, during a press conference to bring attention to Miyares. “If you are born here, you are a citizen.”

President Trump signed the order last January, which would deny citizenship that in the past has been granted by the 14th amendment. Since then, it has faced multiple legal challenges, including a lawsuit signed by 22 attorneys general across the country.

Miyares was not one of those signees, and VACIR says by not joining the lawsuit, Miyares is leaving Virginians vulnerable.

“It is a problem that the Attorney General is disregarding his constituents who pay taxes, that pay his salary, that are urging for the defense of Virginia families,” said Monica Sarmiento with VACIR.

The group said they have made multiple efforts to meet with Miyares and get him to publicly oppose the order, including starting a petition for him to join the lawsuit that has gained more than 1,300 signatures.

“He has abandoned our community, abandoned us, in our most vulnerable time of need,” Sarmiento said.

(KOIN) – A majority of Oregon counties are supporting a federal lawsuit filed by Marion County seeking clarity on Oregon’s sanctuary state laws.

On Monday, Marion County announced that 20 of Oregon’s 36 counties have signed a letter to United States Attorney General Pam Bondi and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, which comes after a handful of Oregon counties initially joined a separate letter of support.

The letter is in support of Marion County’s lawsuit filed in August — seeking a federal court’s opinion on whether the county has the authority to turn over parole records of four alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary law.

In the lawsuit — filed against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons — Marion County argues that Oregon’s sanctuary law conflicts with state public records law and federal immigration law.

Marion County’s lawsuit comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents served subpoenas to the county on August 1, requesting the records of four people on parole for crimes including multiple rape convictions, multiple sexual abuse convictions and convictions for kidnapping/robbery. According to court documents, a fifth subpoena was served for an individual whose identity was not clear at the time.

Now, 20 of Oregon’s 36 counties are signaling support for the lawsuit, Marion County said, noting the counties are supporting the lawsuit but are not joining the litigation.

In their letter, the Oregon counties stated, in part, “Legal uncertainty harms everyone and benefits no one. It is currently unclear how Oregon’s Sanctuary Promise Act, Oregon’s Public Records Act, and federal laws interact and apply due to apparent conflicts, including in situations where a local government is served with an administrative subpoena.”

The Oregon counties are not the only state institutions showing support for the lawsuit.

In late August, the Oregon State Sheriff’s Association sent a letter signed by 34 of 36 sheriff’s offices — also seeking clarity on ICE enforcement.

In response to Oregon counties showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield previously said, “Oregon’s sanctuary law has already been upheld by the courts, including the Ninth Circuit, which made clear it does not conflict with federal law. My office has also been clear with Marion County and others, Oregon sanctuary law allows officials to produce information in response to a judicial warrant, but an administrative subpoena from ICE is not a judicial warrant.”

Rayfield continued, “For immigrant communities, these legal battles can create fear and confusion. My office will vigorously defend Oregon’s sanctuary law, so families feel safe reporting crimes, sending their kids to school, and living their lives without fear of being targeted unfairly.”

Spokespeople for Gov. Kotek and U.S. Attorney General Bondi have previously declined to comment on the pending litigation.

In a statement, Marion County Counsel Steve Elzinga noted, “The federal and state governments disagree about when public records already provided to the media about violent criminals can be provided to federal agents, so Marion County asked the federal court to determine what the law requires.”

The county added that it is “committed to prosecuting and holding accountable all people who commit crimes regardless of their immigration status.”",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/generic-immigration-customs-ice-federal-agents-10072020.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-07 23:56:49.459203

“These funds have no relationship to civil immigration policy, and the Trump administration’s plan to impose conditions on this funding was unlawful and immoral.

Raoul is co-leading this lawsuit with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha.","CHICAGO – Attorney General Kwame Raoul today announced that after he led a coalition of 20 attorneys general in filing a multistate lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the DOJ has now dropped its plan to impose illegal conditions on nearly $1.4 billion in Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, declared that states would be unable to access VOCA funds unless they agreed to the administration’s demands that states assist in federal immigration enforcement. VOCA funds are used to support victims and survivors of crimes and are not related to immigration enforcement.

“This is a win for survivors of violent crimes who rely upon this funding for programs that help them recover from the physical and emotional trauma they have endured,” Raoul said. “These funds have no relationship to civil immigration policy, and the Trump administration’s plan to impose conditions on this funding was unlawful and immoral. I will continue to lead the effort, along with other attorneys general, to protect federal funding for programs that support survivors of violent crimes.”

Following the lawsuit Raoul and the coalition filed, the DOJ is abandoning its plan to impose immigration-related conditions on $178 million in VOCA Victim Assistance Grants and $1.2 billion in VOCA Victim Compensation grants. Now, these grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that states assist the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in immigration enforcement.

Article continues after sponsor message

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. The funding supports victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams and more. The funding streams for these services – totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide – have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents.

States, including Illinois, use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states to be based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump administration, through the DOJ, declared that states, along with the victims and survivors they serve, would be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the administration’s political agenda, namely its immigration enforcement priorities. The DOJ has placed these conditions on $54 million of fiscal year 2025 funds allocated to Illinois to support crime victims.

In order to receive these funds, the Trump administration was requiring states to assist DHS with civil immigration enforcement efforts, which is a federal – not state government – responsibility.

Raoul is co-leading this lawsuit with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. Also part of the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.","President Donald Trump’s administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

The move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.

After the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”

The Latest:

Seeking more immigration barriers, Noem waives environmental protections in New Mexico

The Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.

In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.

The directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.

Laiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.

House Democrats press Trump on drug cartels he designated as terrorist groups

Several House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.

Five U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations.

The lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.

Justice Department names new head of immigration courts

A former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.

Margolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.

Margolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.

Past surgeons general argue HHS secretary is ‘endangering' nation's health

Six former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.

The former public officials — appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush — warned that Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, autism and other issues have undermined the public health system and amplified health misinformation instead of combating it.

An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.

“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.

Oregon Gov. Kotek meets with DHS Sec. Noem in Portland

Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.

Noem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.

White House says it will use tariff revenue to bolster food aid program facing funding shortages

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

Also known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.

Leavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”

Trump meets with American hostage freed from Gaza and with relatives of American killed there

Trump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Trump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says he’ll schedule the swearing in of new Arizona Democrat ‘as soon as she wants’

Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.

Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.

Once she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge blocks changed guidance for teen pregnancy prevention grants

A judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”

The ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”

Federal grand jury in Atlanta charges 2 men with making threats against ICE officer and his wife

A federal grand jury in Atlanta has indicted two men after authorities said they made online threats against an ICE officer and his wife.

Frank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.

Noto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.

Waszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.

National Guard members from Texas are in Illinois in Trump’s latest move to send troops to cities

National Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.

US authorities report 2025 border arrests at 55-year low

Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.

There were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.

The latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.

During September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.

Democrats ask Bondi about Tom Homan: Where’s the money?

As Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.

The investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.

“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.

Bondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.

“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.

GOP senator questions whether National Guard deployment to cities is ‘best practice’

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.

“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.

It was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.

Supreme Court seems skeptical about state bans on ‘conversion therapy’

The Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.

Most justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.

Justice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”

DHS Sec. Kristi Noem to visit Portland

The city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.

The city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”

Her trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.

A federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.

Trump praises Carney as a ‘world-class leader’ and ‘good man’

The president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”

But, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”

When asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”

Trump says he’ll meet with Xi in a few weeks

“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.

Trump says his first-term trade deal with Mexico and Canada could be negotiated – or even replaced

The president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.

But asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.

He offered no further details.

Trump likens Dem tactics on shutdown to a ‘kamikaze attack’

The president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”

“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”

Trump suggests he’ll ‘follow the law’ on federal worker backpay

Asked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”

But asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.

Carney says the U.S. and Canada are competing, not in conflict

The Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”

Carney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”

“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”

GOP senator suggests FBI interview Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after his comments about Epstein

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”

During a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.

“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.

The attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.

Trump says there is ‘natural conflict’ with Canada

The president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”

“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.

Trump says back pay for furloughed federal workers ‘depends on who we’re talking about’

The president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.

He also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”

Trump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.

Chicago mayor says he doesn’t know where National Guard troops are in his city

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.

“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”

The City of Chicago and state of Illinois sued Trump on Monday, seeking to stop the sending of National Guard troops to Chicago. The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

Johnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”

“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”

‘Law is clear’ on federal worker back pay, House Democratic leader says

“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.

“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”

Illinois braces for National Guard deployments amid legal challenge

Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”

A federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.

Local community groups have repeatedly warned Chicagoans that federal agents have detained people in Home Depot parking lots — which many immigrants frequent as they look for construction work.
“ICE agents are standing across the street with guns and tearing families apart.","BACK OF THE YARDS — Southwest Side officials, neighbors and organizers are calling on a Back of the Yards property owner to block federal immigration agents from using its parking lot for enforcement work.

The parking lot of the Yards Plaza, 4636 S. Damen Ave., has been frequently used by agents as a place to detain neighbors, transfer detained people and stage operations, local organizers have said. They and others called on the plaza’s owner, Friedman Real Estate, to block federal agents from working there.

“Friedman, we want you to kick ICE out of your property today,” said Corina Pedraza, a member of the Southwest Side Rapid Response Team, at a press conference Tuesday held next to the lot. The group has been recording ICE sightings, among other things, as a way to protect neighbors.

Friedman Real Estate did not immediately respond to Block Club’s request for comment.

Tuesday’s press conference came as tensions are ever-heightening due to operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which the federal government launched last month to increase immigration enforcement in and around Chicago. People and officials have increasingly sought ways to peacefully resist — including by trying to limit places where ICE can work.

On Monday, Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order restricting federal agents from using city-owned properties for immigration enforcement. Officials have called on private property owners to opt in to the program, with the city offering signs that could deter agents from properties where the owner has joined in.

Ald. Julia Ramirez (12th) urged Friedman Real Estate to join the program. She called the property owners about two weeks ago to ask them to refuse entry to immigration agents, but company leaders refused and instead said they don’t want neighbors filming federal agents, she said.

“Friedman can well use their private security to inform agents that they are not allowed to stage on the back of this plaza,” Ramirez said at Tuesday’s press conference.

Those at the press conference called on other companies to join in, especially if their properties have been used by immigration agents, like Home Depot and Walmart. Local community groups have repeatedly warned Chicagoans that federal agents have detained people in Home Depot parking lots — which many immigrants frequent as they look for construction work.

The Yards Plaza shopping strip is home to a Planet Fitness gym, a Dollar Tree and a Taco Bell restaurant, among other businesses. It is across the street from Back of the Yards College Preparatory and near Agustin Lara Academy, an elementary school, and the Back of the Yards public library.

“ICE agents are standing across the street with guns and tearing families apart. That is impacting our students. … That’s not safety, that’s intimidation,” said Yesenia Lopez, a member of the Chicago Public Schools Board of Education representing the 7th District.

Southwest Side neighbors have been among the most targeted by immigration agents during the operations, Ramirez said. Masked and sometimes armed federal agents using “brutal tactics” have impacted the way people move in the neighborhoods, take care of their kids, shop for groceries and support one another, she said.

Russell Hott, ICE field director in Chicago, told Block Club more than 1,000 people have been arrested under Operation Midway Blitz and “several thousand” are still wanted.

Members of local rapid response teams said they’ll continue to coordinate their efforts to verify sightings of ICE agents and document their tactics, as well as to educate neighbors about their rights.

“We will use everything in our power to resist and to remind people that Chicago is our home,” Pedraza said. “We are putting business owners on notice [that] their silence and their complacent behavior towards ICE’s racist agenda will not be tolerated.

“We call on other business owners, corporations and companies that profit off of our money to step up and make sure you exercise your ability to kick ICE out of your private lots.”

The letter urges DOJ leadership to ""adhere to the legal guardrails and institutional norms,"" Congress to ""exercise its oversight responsibilities far more vigorously,"" and fellow alumni and all Americans to speak out.
It concludes that ""our democracy is only as strong as the rule of law, and the rule of law can't survive without the principal institution that enforces it.""
""It says it all that the former Qatar lobbyist Bondi penned a DOJ memo—i.e.","In the lead-up to US Attorney General Pam Bondi's Tuesday testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, hundreds of former employees of the Department of Justice and outside watchdog groups sounded the alarm about the current state of the DOJ.

""From prosecutors, special agents, and intelligence analysts to immigration judges, grant managers, civil rights attorneys, and more, we all carried out our duties faithfully, regardless of who occupied the White House. Until we no longer could,"" the 282 ex-DOJ employees wrote in a Monday letter released by the alumni network Justice Connection.

""Each of us left the department, either voluntarily or involuntarily, because of actions taken by this administration,"" they continued. ""It is incumbent on all of us to fight for the Justice Department before it's too late.""

The letter, first reported by MSNBC, calls out the DOJ for carrying out President Donald Trump's ""retribution campaign,"" spreading lies about the ""deep state,"" violating court orders, and inappropriately dismissing employees, including at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and attorneys in the Civil Rights Division.

""The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other long-standing work the department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,"" the letter notes, citing attacks on the Tax Division, the Public Integrity Section, FBI public corruption squads, and hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for at-risk communities.

""As for its treatment of its employees, the current leadership's behavior has been appalling,"" the letter adds. ""Demonizing, firing, demoting, involuntarily transferring, and directing employees to violate their ethical duties has already caused an exodus of over 5,000 of us.""

The letter urges DOJ leadership to ""adhere to the legal guardrails and institutional norms,"" Congress to ""exercise its oversight responsibilities far more vigorously,"" and fellow alumni and all Americans to speak out. It concludes that ""our democracy is only as strong as the rule of law, and the rule of law can't survive without the principal institution that enforces it.""

In a statement, Stacey Young, executive director and founder of Justice Connection, echoed that warning: ""For decades, the guiding tenet for those working at the department was to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons. Many believe that's no longer possible.""

""They're being asked to put loyalty to the president over the Constitution, the rule of law, and their professional ethical obligations,"" she added. ""We're seeing the erosion of the Justice Department's fabric and integrity at an alarming pace. Our democratic system cannot survive without the primary institution that enforces the law.""

Bondi and other DOJ leaders—particularly FBI Director Kash Patel—have faced mounting criticism throughout the second Trump administration, including for the attorney general's Day One memo arguing that department employees are expected to ""zealously defend"" the president's interests and policies.

""The abuse of the Justice Department under Bondi's watch has been rampant, including the recent high-profile and scandalous move to secure an indictment against former FBI Director Jim Comey after the president publicly demanded they do so, and despite the previous prosecutor’s claims of insufficient evidence,"" Public Citizen co-president Lisa Gilbert said in a Tuesday statement.

""The DOJ has been in constant turmoil since Bondi took the helm, firing prosecutors who worked Capitol riot cases or investigated Trump and pushing out senior officials at the FBI,"" she continued. ""At the same time, under her leadership, the Public Integrity Section of the DOJ, the section dedicated to fighting corruption from federal officials, has been reduced from a total of 36 employees to two.""

""The Department of Justice is intended to be independent from the White House, not its revenge arm,"" Gilbert stressed. ""Her tenure shows they have become exactly that.""

Accountable.US executive director Tony Carrk also issued a statement ahead of the Senate hearing. He said that ""in her eight months as Attorney General, Pam Bondi has confirmed all warnings about her treating the office as an enforcer for Donald Trump's personal whims while also acting as a walking conflict of interest for her former lobbying firm and clients.""

""It says it all that the former Qatar lobbyist Bondi penned a DOJ memo—i.e. corruption 'get out of jail free card'—allowing Donald Trump to use a gifted luxury super jet from the nation he's doing billions of dollars in crypto business with during and after his presidency,"" he continued.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61720975&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-10-07 20:56:36.887552

For weeks, federal agents with ICE and other agencies have carried out violent immigration arrests across Chicago, including in a high-profile raid on a residential building in which many U.S. citizens were also detained. “There’s no emergency,” says Yohnka, who blames the administration for needlessly escalating tensions in Chicago, seemingly in search of excuses for more violence. “And when anybody protests, then that’s seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces,” says Yohnka.

TRANSCRIPT

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: A federal judge in Chicago has refused the Illinois attorney general’s request to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to the state, instead saying she’ll hear arguments on Thursday. This is in contrast to Portland, Oregon, where a federal judge appointed by President Trump did issue a restraining order to stop Trump from sending troops. Illinois Governor Pritzker said Monday he would not back down.

GOV. JB PRITZKER: Since the beginning of this invasion, families have been snatched up off the streets or removed from their homes, zip-tied and detained for hours, including especially U.S. citizens and legal residents of our state. And in the words of CBP chief patrol agent Greg Bovino, they’re being chosen by how they look.

AMY GOODMAN: Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson announced he had signed an executive order to stop federal immigration agents from using certain city-owned spaces.

MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON: The order establishes ICE-free zones. That means that city property and unwilling private businesses will no longer serve as staging grounds for these raids.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes after an overnight ICE raid on a Chicago apartment complex days ago, when ICE agents, wearing fatigues and carrying guns, rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter and zip-tied children and U.S. citizens while carrying out arrests. A neighbor described the terrifying ordeal to ABC 7 Chicago.

EBONI WATSON: They was terrified. The kids was crying. People were screaming. They looked very distraughted. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids out, too, had them zip-tied to each other. That’s all I kept asking: Where’s the morality? Where’s the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘[bleep] them kids.’”

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Friday, federal agents handcuffed Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes and briefly detained her when she asked if they had a signed warrant for a man they were trying to detain at a hospital.

JESSIE FUENTES: He has constitutional rights.

FEDERAL AGENT 1: No.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed —

FEDERAL AGENT 1: No. You need to leave.

JESSIE FUENTES: — judicial warrant for me?

FEDERAL AGENT 1: Turn around. You’re impeding. Turn around and leave.

FEDERAL AGENT 2: Yeah. He is under —

FEDERAL AGENT 1: I am going to arrest you if you do not leave.

FEDERAL AGENT 2: He is under arrest.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant?

FEDERAL AGENT 2: You are going to be placed under arrest.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant for me?

FEDERAL AGENT 1: You need to leave.

AMY GOODMAN: For those who can’t see, the agent then pulled her hands behind her back and handcuffed her. The video was shared in a report by the news outlet Book Club Chicago, which is part of a coalition of Chicago journalists and activists who filed a new lawsuit with the ACLU of Illinois against the Trump administration over a pattern of, quote, “extreme brutality,” unquote, by federal agents during protests at the Broadview ICE detention center in a Chicago suburb. In this CBS News Chicago story, correspondent Asal Rezaei describes how she was attacked while reporting at the ICE jail.

ASAL REZAEI: An ICE agent that was masked pointed his weapon and shot directly at my car. He saw that my window was open, and he shot right here. You can see the point of impact right there.

MARISSA SULEK: You can see white powder exploded on the hood of her car, windshield, and even engulfed the inside.

ASAL REZAEI: And I was sitting right there with my window open. A lot of it went inside of my car and on my face. I immediately felt it burning. I started throwing up.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the ACLU of Illinois.

Ed, thanks so much for being with us. There’s so much to discuss here, I mean, one lawsuit after another, most recently yesterday, the filing of the lawsuit around the deploying the federalized troops to Chicago. Apparently, Governor Abbott allowed the troops to go from Texas, and they’re in Indiana right now. But talk about the judge’s ruling and the other lawsuits, as well, that you’re a part of.

ED YOHNKA: Sure. So, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, as you say, filed a lawsuit yesterday to challenge the federalization of National Guard and deploying them here, for a very simple reason: There’s no emergency, and there’s no justification for having done — or, for having guards or troops here in the city of Chicago or in the Chicagoland area.

In fact, what we have seen over the last few weeks is the escalation of violence and chaos on behalf of ICE agents, or conducted by ICE agents, everything from, you know, marching up and down in fatigues and pulling families out of parks, marching up and down Michigan Avenue, pulling families out of parks, to, as was described in our lawsuit yesterday with a coalition of legal organizations, you know, taking on what we’ve seen is, you know, just the indiscriminate firing of projectiles and chemical weapons at the Broadview detention center and — or, processing center, which has become a detention center.

So, what we’re seeing, and, you know, in the other clips you played, is just this escalation of violence. And when anybody protests, then that’s seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces. But further forces are just going to escalate tensions here. They’re not going to make things better.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ed, could you talk about that, this remarkable raid that occurred last week at an apartment complex that the ICE were claiming that it was a hotbed for Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang? Can you talk about what actually happened there?

ED YOHNKA: Yes. And, you know, Juan, you know how just incredible and, you know, remarkable this is, as a Chicagoan. Last week, what we saw was, in the middle of the night, hundreds of heavily armed ICE agents, you know, masked up, attacked a single apartment building, broke into that building, rappelled off of a Black Hawk helicopter to get to the roof of the building, then proceeded to go through the building and kick down every single door that they could, take whomever they found into custody, and then, as we know, release some of those people hours later because they either had no background, criminal background, they were green card holders, and, in many cases, you know, they were citizens, including zip-tying children, zip-tying children out in the streets of Chicago, separating them from their families and then hauling them away, as well.

You know, this is just — you know, and we have not yet, to this hour, heard any justification or rationalization for why it was that they needed this kind of overwhelming force. There’s not been charges brought against anybody. There’s been no explanation. There’s been no production of a warrant in public to justify why an entire apartment building was attacked. Even if there was a person or set of people in the building that they wanted to try to detain, they didn’t need to literally render, you know, a hundred people unhoused because they’ve created a situation where they can’t go back into the building.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And have they — have there been any reports of who was actually detained or where the people are?

ED YOHNKA: No, that’s been very difficult to find out, Juan. In fact, you know, our lawyers have spent the last several days trying to talk to people who lived in the building, trying to talk to neighbors and others around there, to see if we can find out where these people were taken to, to see what happened to them, to hear about their experiences firsthand. But the reporting on this is just awful.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the possibility of President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, and how rare this is?

ED YOHNKA: It would be incredibly rare, Amy. As you know, the Insurrection Act has been used only a few times in our country’s history. And the purposes of the Insurrection Act are in no way, shape or form met in the city of Chicago. There is no invasion here. There is no armed conflict going on. There is no, you know, sabotage to the actions of the federal government.

And in fact, the courts and the government and everyone else is proceeding and operating in the normal fashion. You know, just to make the point, yesterday, government lawyers stood against state lawyers in a federal courthouse and in a federal courtroom to raise the question about whether or not National Guard was available. Police stopped people yesterday in the city of Chicago. ICE continued to make raids in the city of Chicago. There is nothing here that justifies something as extreme as declaring that there is an insurrection, which requires, you know, troops and allowing troops to engage in practices that take them beyond just, quote-unquote, “providing protection” for federal officials.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk, Ed, also about the response of local city officials? There was an extraordinary press conference by Police Superintendent Snelling yesterday, where he said that some — more than 20 Chicago police officers were actually hit with tear gas at Broadview, fired by ICE agents.

ED YOHNKA: Actually, that was at a protest after a person was shot in the Brighton Park neighborhood —

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Oh, Brighton Park, I’m sorry, yeah.

ED YOHNKA: — on Saturday. CPD responded to that event because of the fact that there was shots fired. There was — you know, people had gathered around. There were people protesting, decrying the fact that ICE had once again shot someone, as we saw here a couple of weeks ago in a traffic stop. And in this instance, you know, CPD showed up to try to assist with crowd control, with clearing the traffic and allowing people to move on, and ICE, instead of letting CPD or any other official do their — other officials do their job, simply began to fire tear gas at the crowd.

This is the same thing, by the way, we’ve seen in Broadview. Last weekend, the Illinois State Police set up a protection zone at Broadview and tried to sort of create at least some barrier between ICE agents and others. And again, rather than working with local police, ICE just continued to behave in the way that they have for the past few weeks, to go through the crowd when they wanted to, to try to push back the crowd. You know, these are just these kind of bullying, goonish tactics that we’re just seeing them do anywhere. And it doesn’t matter if they’re, you know, trying — if they’re pushing back against protesters, against clergy members, against journalists or against the police. They just seem to think that they have the power to act and behave in whatever way they want.

AMY GOODMAN: Ed, we were just showing video put out by the Department of Homeland Security, as you were talking about the Black Hawk helicopter, ICE agents rappelling down from it, armed, automatic weapons, the agents moving into apartments. They’re putting it out because, presumably, they think this is good propaganda for them. Can you comment on this, the terror that these families felt, with faces not being obscured?

ED YOHNKA: Let me — thanks, Amy, for giving me the chance to speak to this. And let me start by noting they put out this propaganda reel before they ever explained what the actual rationale for the raid is. So, the most important thing for them was to have HD video of what was happening, not to actually speak to why this happened.

And what you’re — you know, what you see in that video, and I think what you hear from members of the community, is a complete terror, a sense of terror that their community, a working-class, Black and Brown community, is being targeted in this way by federal forces using this kind of militarized force. And it is — you know, it’s causing, you know, panic and terror and fear all across the community for many. There are people who are not leaving their homes every day out of fear. There are children who are not going to school. You know, restaurants and cafes and stores in some of our neighborhoods are suffering economically as the result of this fact. And all of this is in service of a reckless policy that is not in any way, shape or form making the city of Chicago or the Chicagoland area any more safe.

AMY GOODMAN: Thank you for being with us, Ed Yohnka, ACLU of Illinois director of communications.

Coming up, we go to Gaza as negotiators from Israel and Hamas are indirectly engaged in ceasefire talks. Stay with us.

A federal judge did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states.","President Trump argues the National Guard is needed in Chicago — a city that had its fewest summer murders in 60 years — because it is overrun with crime.

But the conditions to legally justify troop deployments in Chicago simply don't exist, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told Morning Edition. The state filed a lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration in which it argues that the Illinois National Guard can only be federalized if there is a foreign invasion, rebellion or if the federal government is unable to enforce federal laws.

The only ""agitation"" and ""chaos"" in and around Chicago, Raoul said, is from ""[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol firing pepper gas at civilians, journalists,"" and ""even Chicago police officers.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including a recent raid of an apartment building during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.

Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year, according to WBEZ.

Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House to make a formal request for troops. The president also posted on Truth Social last month that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""

""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.

In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

A federal judge did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member — said in an interview with Morning Edition if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.

But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""

""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.

On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""

""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday visited the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, where protests continue amid the administration’s immigration crackdown.

Videos shared inside the facility showed Noem meeting with local officials and taking the first few minutes to pray over officers.

Her visit followed a heated meeting with Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek at the Portland airport, the governor's office confirmed.

""Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland. I was clear that I have confidence in local law enforcement to meet the moment.""

The governor added that she requested DHS and ICE ""obey Oregon laws when they engage in federal operations.""

Minutes later, the governor's office released a separate statement, confirming Kotek directed the U.S. Northern Command to take ""immediate action"" to demobilize Oregon’s 200 National Guard members and California's 200 National Guard members, who were deployed to Portland to protect federal property and personnel near the facility.

The move came after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a temporary restraining order Saturday halting the deployment of Oregon troops, and expanded the order Sunday, prohibiting the federal government from deploying any federalized National Guard troops within Oregon.

Kotek directed the return of all 200 California National Guard members to California.

The Hill reached out to DHS for a comment on the lawsuit.","The Chicago News Guild on Monday joined other news organizations that have sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in connection with allegations of excessive force used on journalists at recent protests in the area.

“As a labor union, we fight to protect the health and safety of our members and their right to do the essential work of reporting the news,” the union said in a statement on Monday. “The Chicago News Guild has joined a lawsuit, filed today in federal court, to stop the targeting of our members and other journalists by ICE agents and other DHS agents in Broadview.”

The union joined journalists with the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians (NABET) Local 41, the Chicago Headline Club and Block Club Chicago.

“Many civilians and press are being injured and sickened, to the point of serious

injuries,” the lawsuit reads. “Some are being randomly singled out for arrest. They are tackled to the ground, handcuffed, and marched into the Broadview ICE facility, where they are detained

incommunicado for hours … . Defendants are acting to intimidate and silence the press and civilians engaged in protected First Amendment activities.”

The lawsuit describes violent incidents and rhetoric used by the Trump administration as it attempts to send the National Guard into Chicago, with federal officials citing “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness.” State and local officials have filed separate lawsuits and slammed the administration’s actions.

Mentioned in the lawsuit is a CBS News Chicago reporter who was burned inside a car after a masked ICE agent shot a pepper ball at her vehicle. The complaint also describes an incident where a Presbyterian minister offered prayers to a crowd of demonstrators before being sprayed with tear gas and struck by pepper balls.

His statement Oct. 6 came as hundreds of California National Guardsmen are in limbo at a Portland military base as Trump and Democratic leaders wage a feverish legal battle over his attempts to deploy soldiers in American cities.

Trump ordered the Oregon Guard late last month to move into Portland, but local leaders sued and a federal judge temporarily halted the deployment. Then Trump deployed California and Texas Guard troops, but the Oregon judge stopped all federal troops from entering.

A similar standoff also was unfolding in Chicago.

Here's what to know about the National Guard deployments.

Trump's Portland deployment sets up of legal fight

Trump's first attempt to go after Portland demonstrators was Sept. 28: he ordered 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the region for an initial 60 days, according to court documents.

The troops, he said, would ""protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"" and would use ""Full Force, if necessary,"" he wrote in a Truth Social post.

After Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, filed suit, a federal judge suspended the deployment Oct. 4.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, ruled the deployment was unnecessary because the demonstrations did not amount to a ""rebellion,"" and law enforcement was capable of handling the protests without military intervention.

National Guard Whac-A-Mole

The Trump administration then took up a new strategy: switch states.

Hours after the judge barred the Oregon troops, he tapped California guardsmen to take on the same job. Early Oct. 5, about 100 California National Guard troops arrived at the Portland Air National Guard base, followed by another 99 guardsmen that afternoon, according to court documents. That prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to join Kotek's lawsuit in an attempt to take back control of his state's troops.

The administration also ordered 400 members of the Texas National Guard to ""perform federal protection missions where needed, including in the cities of Portland and Chicago,"" according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Hegseth's order to the Texas National Guard – which came with Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's permission – notably left open that the troops could be deployed ""where needed.""

Immergut then issued an order temporarily halting all federal National Guard deployments to Portland.

Trump appealed that ruling Oct. 6, seeking to wrest control of those troops.

Joseph Nunn, a legal expert at the Brennan Center who specializes in National Guard deployments, said at the heart of Immergut's ruling was ""whether the facts on the ground justify deploying troops.""

""The fundamental problem for the Trump administration in Portland is that what they are saying is happening in Portland simply isn’t true,"" Nunn said.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said of Immergut's ruling: ""With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.""

""The ICE facility has been really under siege by these anarchists outside,"" Leavitt said. ""We are very confident in the president's legal authority to do this.""

'Chipocalypse now'

While the battle over Portland played out, Trump also ordered 300 Illinois National Guardsmen into Chicago on Oct. 4. He had also threatened an Illinois deployment in taunting comments and social media posts, including one that read ""Chipocalypse now"" in a reference to the Vietnam War-era film ""Apocalypse Now"" that depicted Trump in the foreground as the lieutenant colonel from the movie with helicopters flying over a burning Chicago skyline behind him.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, sued Oct. 6 to stop the deployment.

""Let me be clear – Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation's cities,"" Pritzker said at a news conference.

Trump deploys military to multiple cities

The Trump administration also sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, earlier this year. Both deployments drew similar lawsuits from Democratic leaders.

In the nation's capital, more than 2,000 troops from the city's own National Guard force and other states have been deployed since mid-August. Those troops also have been assigned to pick up trash and help out with soup kitchens, among other ""beautification"" projects. Brian Schwalb, the city's attorney general, filed suit in early September to end the deployment.

The Trump administration sent about 5,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to control possible violence amid demonstrations against a wave of deportations. All but a few hundred of the soldiers – some of whom were sent to Portland over the weekend – have gone home.

A judge later ruled the deployment was illegal and violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids National Guard members acting on federal orders from carrying out law enforcement functions. The Trump admistration is appealing that ruling.

Trump also has deployed troops to fight crime in Memphis, Tennessee – with the consent of the state's Republican governor – and to assist immigration enforcement agents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump's use of National Guard called 'unprecedented'

Nunn, from the Brennan Center, said Trump's wielding of the National Guard is ""unprecedented in American history.""

""The president seems to want the U.S. military to spend a lot more time pointing their weapons at Americans than defending Americans,"" he said. ""That is a dramatic shift from how we have always done things in the United States.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/30/USAT/86446760007-2230417719.jpg?crop=5081,2859,x0,y264&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-07 17:57:55.211966

Each day, we’re seeing neighbors kidnapped from our streets, detained in unsafe and inhumane conditions, and deported without due process to countries they’ve never known.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s this: The more Americans see of this agenda, the less they like it. And the more immigrants tell their stories, the better people understand why they belong.

Over 15 percent of Americans are immigrants. If you live here, there’s a good chance you know one. Since the late 1800s, we’ve called on immigrants to work in industry, health care, hospitality, agriculture, and other essential jobs. Immigration is a core to our story about who we are.

Immigrants contribute greatly to our culture and economy. They work jobs, pay taxes, volunteer in churches and schools, support American sports teams, and eat American foods. In 2022, immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes — more than many big name corporations.

At the root of why immigrants come to this country is the promise of a better life — a better job, a better education for their children, a chance to reunite with family. It’s not an easy choice to pick up and leave, and the journey is often perilous. But it’s often the only choice for migrants facing violence, death threats, climate disasters, or extreme poverty.

Against all odds, on average a few million have made their way here each year for the past five years. And generally speaking, the American people want them here — over 60 percent of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s cruel treatment of immigrants.

It turns out that deporting people to unsafe “third countries” they’ve never been to, building concentration camps like Alligator Alcatraz, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and deputizing local and state police as immigration enforcement are all unpopular.

Immigrants without a criminal conviction now make up the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE. Yet the GOP’s Big Ugly Bill provided $170 billion to enact Trump’s unpopular mass deportation agenda.

Immigrant advocates like Jeanette Vizguerra are fighting back. The cost can be great — but the American people are listening.

Jeanette is a mother of four, an undocumented worker, and long-time immigrant rights activist currently in ICE detention despite having no criminal record. She founded the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition and, in 2017, was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, ICE agents detained Jeanette outside the Target store where she worked. She’s fighting her case in court, arguing that the Trump administration targeted her for her activism. Hundreds of union members, friends, and supporters have rallied outside the Aurora, Colorado detention center where she’s being held.

Also crucial to the movement are groups fighting immigration enforcement and detention. The Detention Watch Network works with local members across the nation to shut down detention facilities and block ICE expansion, urges lawmakers to cut enforcement and detention funding, and educates the public about the impact of immigration policy on ordinary people.

Both Jeanette and Detention Watch Network strive to shift from an immigration approach that emphasizes punishment to one built on dignity and freedom. Together, they’ve been awarded the 49th Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award by the Institute for Policy Studies, my organization, for their ongoing bravery and commitment to protecting our neighbors and loved ones.

The immigrant rights movement continues to fight for the human right to move and stay — and for dignified lives for all. And even with little support among mainstream politicians or the media, they’re making a huge impact in this dangerous time: Nearly 80 percent of Americans now say immigration is good for this country — a record high.

It’s time for our lawmakers and politicians to listen to their constituents. Immigration should remain a vital part of the U.S. past, present, and future.",https://ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/americans-dislike-Trumps-immigration-agenda.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:57:35.132228

“What has taken place since January 20, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” he said.. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi.
In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain in American history.
The attorney general avoided talking about the indictment, saying it was a “pending case”, but argued it was approved by “one of the most liberal grand juries in the country”.
“You sure didn’t have order when you stormed secretary Noem,” the attorney general said.","Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, sparred on Tuesday with Democratic senators who demanded answers on her involvement in Donald Trump’s crackdown on political opponents, deployment of national guard troops to cities nationwide and handling of the Epstein files.

The clashes at an annual Senate judiciary committee hearing come after months of allegations from the Democrats that Trump has compromised the justice department’s traditional independence and instead used it to bring charges for political reasons.

Federal prosecutors have indicted the former FBI director James Comey, while a reported federal investigation of Tom Homan, the “border czar”, was dropped after Trump took office. Meanwhile, the president has continued to deploy national guard troops into Democratic-led jurisdictions for missions billed as fighting crime and safeguarding immigration agents, over the objections of local leaders.

Throughout the five-hour hearing, Bondi declined to talk about many of the administration’s controversial decisions, despite persistent questioning from the Democrats. When pressed, she personally attacked several senators from the minority or invoked the ongoing government shutdown to depict them as negligent.

“You voted to shut down the government, and you’re sitting here. Our law enforcement officers aren’t being paid,” Bondi replied when the committee’s top Democratic senator, Dick Durbin of Illinois, questioned the Trump administration’s rationale for sending the national guard into Chicago.

“I wish you love Chicago as much as you hate President Trump,” she continued, adding: “If you’re not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will.”

In his opening statement, Durbin described Bondi as doing lasting damage to the department tasked with enforcing federal law.

“What has taken place since January 20, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” he said.. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi. In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain in American history. It will take decades to recover.”

Of particular concern to Democrats were the charges against Comey, which came after Trump publicly called on Bondi to indict his enemies and fired a veteran prosecutor who refused to bring the case.

The attorney general avoided talking about the indictment, saying it was a “pending case”, but argued it was approved by “one of the most liberal grand juries in the country”.

She was similarly dismissive of questions about the closing of the Homan investigation, in which he was said to have promised immigration-related federal contracts in return for $50,000 from an undercover FBI agent.

“The Department of Justice and the FBI conducted a thorough review, and they found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing,” Bondi said. She also refused to discuss the legal rationale behind the Trump administration’s attacks on boats allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

When Democratic senators became persistent, Bondi responded with critiques and allegations of hypocrisy. Durbin asked the attorney general why she had said earlier this year there was a list of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s clients “sitting on my desk”, only for the justice department to announce no such document existed.

“If you listen to my entire clip on that, I said I had not reviewed it yet,” she said.

Durbin then asked Bondi why there was no signature on a July memo from her department saying it had determined that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and no further details about his case would be made public.

“Did you take money from Reid Hoffman, campaign donations, who was a huge Epstein friend?” Bondi replied.

Hoffman is a billionaire venture capitalist who donates to Democrats. He has acknowledged and apologized for collaborating with Epstein on fundraising, but denied being one of his clients.

“Eventually, you’re going to have to answer for your conduct,” Durbin warned. “You won’t do it today, but eventually you will.”

After saying he was concerned about the politicization of the justice department, Senator Alex Padilla got into a back and forth with Bondi. He called for order, prompting Bondi to invoke a June incident where Padilla was briefly handcuffed at a Los Angeles press conference by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.

“You sure didn’t have order when you stormed secretary Noem,” the attorney general said.

The ugliest exchanges came during questioning from Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California and longtime Trump foe, who the administration recently accused of mortgage fraud.

As he sought details from Bondi on the handling of the Homan investigation, the attorney general said: “If you worked for me, you would have been fired, because you were censured by Congress for lying.”

Schiff, a former representative, was censured in 2023 by the Republican-led House of Representatives for his involvement in Trump’s first impeachment.

Republican senators generally spoke positively of Bondi, or used their questioning to ask how she would address specific criminal justice issues. Several expressed anger over a report published on Monday that Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed during Joe Biden’s presidency to prosecute Trump, obtained data of nine lawmakers’ phone calls.

“I’ve heard them say that Joe Biden never targeted his political enemies,” Republican senator Josh Hawley said of the Democrats. “Huh? That’s interesting, because I could have sworn that yesterday we learned that the FBI tapped my phone.”

Smith’s cases against the president ended when he won re-election last year. His report into the prosecutions mentions communications between senators and an unnamed co-conspirator, and notes that the justice department’s public integrity section was consulted during the investigation to ensure they did not run afoul of specific protections the law affords to members of Congress.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6426e93a01b83337d36da9b73f1b82c59486bd/447_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8d1b4633e819917617db84bf443d5b8",N,,2025-10-07 16:57:27.377333

It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration.","In an effort to weaponize an agency that provides pathways to legal immigration, the Trump administration is arming the United States Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS) for the first time since the agency was created.

Under new regulations published in September, USCIS special agents will be allowed to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute search and arrest warrants. This is the latest effort in Donald Trump’s agenda to systematically restrict legal immigration and strip people of their legal status. The administration’s goal is to redeploy as many parts of the federal government as possible to serve a mass deportation system that will detain and remove as many people as possible.

USCIS is Not an Immigration Enforcement Agency

USCIS is a federal agency that oversees lawful immigration. It decides whether to grant immigration applications and petitions, including applications for green cards, work authorization, asylum, citizenship, and more.

Before USCIS was created, one agency was responsible for most aspects of U.S. immigration law, including carrying out immigration enforcement and deciding immigration benefits. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, it separated these duties into three separate agencies: USCIS was created to focus exclusively on deciding immigration benefits, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were charged with law enforcement duties. Congress deliberately separated these functions to allow USCIS to more efficiently and effectively adjudicate immigration benefits, stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not recombine these functions in one agency.

Keeping USCIS separate from ICE and CBP also helped to ensure that people felt comfortable coming forward and applying for immigration benefits. By blurring these lines, the Trump administration is hoping to make it harder and more intimidating for people to apply for and obtain benefits that they are eligible for under U.S. law. This move will also redirect USCIS resources away from deciding whether to grant immigration benefits, and towards supporting ICE. Applications and petitions will languish and processing times will increase. All of this is by design—this administration intentionally keeps immigrants in more vulnerable immigration statuses to limit their rights and make it easier to deport them.

Trump Weaponizes Federal Agencies for Mass Deportations

The Trump administration is using this new rule to bypass Congress and turn USCIS into another arm of ICE. It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration. For example, USCIS has announced several new policies that, if implemented, will make it harder for qualified immigrants to access citizenship and may stall naturalizations on a large scale. The agency has also instituted hurdles for naturalized citizens seeking to register to vote. Under another new policy, USCIS will deny benefits to people it decides may support “anti-American” ideologies or activities.

Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has weaponized agency after agency to carry out his mass deportation agenda. For example, the Department of Justice stated it would prioritize stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans. The administration has co-opted the military: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has deployed members of the military and used Department of Defense resources for immigration enforcement. ICE has aggressively recruited local police and sheriffs, convincing over one thousand department leaders to forgo local safety priorities and become an arm of its deportation machine. DHS has even deputized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officers to help immigration enforcement, and attempted to force the IRS as well as Medicare and Medicaid to share information with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes.

USCIS Policy Changes Undermines Citizenship and Silences Immigrants

Turning USCIS into an enforcement agency is another blatant attempt to stigmatize and harm people who are immigrants—including long-time residents who are American in every way, but on paper. USCIS’s recent policy changes undermine the very bedrock of our democracy by keeping people from seeking legal status and citizenship. If immigrants cannot access citizenship and other immigration benefits, we risk having an underclass of people subject to the whims of this administration’s loyalty tests and able to be exploited. Just look at Miller’s plans to deprive noncitizen children of education and deny citizenship to American-born children.

The Trump administration is erasing our history as a nation of immigrants and attempting to rewrite what it means to be an American by intimidating immigrants, pushing them into the shadows, and silencing dissenters.

These attacks are a reminder that our undocumented neighbors and loved ones deserve a path to citizenship. They are raising families, paying taxes, and working to make our nation thrive.

In 2021, Texas immigration attorney Adam A. Malik had his phone seized by border agents.","Last week, attorney Andrew Lattarulo was on his way home from Aruba when his iPhone 15 Pro Max was seized by Homeland Security and Border Control agents at Boston Logan International Airport. Perhaps un-coincidentally, Lattarulo is a well-known immigration in the Boston area — his clients include the father of a 4-month old whose arrest by ICE drew public scrutiny — and has a popular social media presence that calls out problematic practices of immigration agents and is critical of Donald Trump’s policies.

As a result, he filed a lawsuit alleging violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights. Lattarulo also filed an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order blocking the search of his phone and its return, as it contains confidential client information, as well as privileged information between himself and other attorneys. As stated in the motion, “The seizure was made eight hours after plaintiff had been inspected by United States Customs and Border Protection at a border crossing. Plaintiff’s phone was unlawfully seized and most likely searched in violation of plaintiff’s First and Fourth Amendments, and the constitutional rights of his clients.”

District of Massachusetts Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted the TRO, barring the government from searching the phone or analyzing any data that may have already been collected.

Lattarulo’s attorneys, Mary Lemay and Patrick Hanley from Butters Brazilian, said, “We believe attorney Lattarulo was targeted because he represents clients in immigration-related proceedings, and he has amplified the government’s own enforcement priorities via social media to immigrant communities and anyone else who might be interested.”

“Public criticism of our government is protected speech under the First Amendment. We initiated this suit to protect not only attorney Lattarulo’s constitutional rights, but also those of his clients.”

But this early success may not translate to ultimate victory. In 2021, Texas immigration attorney Adam A. Malik had his phone seized by border agents. The Fifth Circuit ruled DHS’s use of a filter team to sort out any privileged materials was sufficient to protect Malik’s clients, and that the government’s asserted connection between the attorney and an arms dealer created probable cause even if Malik is correct that the connection “appears dubious in hindsight.”",https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/GettyImages-2213399102-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:59:02.634050

The governor said she once again stated that there isn't an insurrection in the state, and pointed to the military in Portland.

""I reiterated that I continue to be focused on doing whatever I can to protect Oregonians from military intervention or harmful federal law enforcement tactics,” Gov. Kotek said. You can read her full statement below.

Shortly before her arrival, the Portland Police Bureau closed off streets surrounding the ICE building at South Macadam Avenue and Bancroft Street.

The police bureau said the closure would be temporary for a ""dignitary visit,"" and that people should avoid the area in the south waterfront and plan alternate routes.

Our news crews and others in the area say there were no arrests made when police closed off the blocks around the building.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Mayor Keith Wilson's office said they received notice of her visit, but did not provide additional details about the visit.

Sec. Noem's motorcade left the airport at about noon.

Conservative commentator Benny Johnson posted on his Instagram early this morning that he is coming to interview Noem at the ICE facility in South Portland.

Johnson posted on X a video of her arrival at the facility:

You can read the statement from the City of Portland below:

""We are aware that Secretary Noem is visiting the Portland area. Although the City received notice of her visit, we do not have full details about her agenda.

In the interest of public safety, Portland Police will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary. This protects our community, by making sure our roads and public spaces stay safe.

Consistent with Portland’s sanctuary city status, our local police will not support any federal immigration enforcement activities.

We urge Portlanders to continue to remain safe. Recent court decisions have affirmed that Portland does not need federal military intervention, and that our local public-safety approach stands on firm legal ground.""

Oregon Senator Ron Wyden issued a statement talking about Sec. Noem visiting Portland:

“Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official. In reality, she's been sent by Trump to incite violence. Don't tar and feather her as Speaker Johnson suggested for Governor Newsom. The best response to her playacting as cop? Ignore her and keep supporting the members of our community.”

Oregon Gov. Kotek issued the following statement after meeting with Secretary Noem:

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland. I was clear that I have confidence in local law enforcement to meet the moment.

“I requested that Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents obey Oregon laws when they engage in federal operations. I reiterated that I continue to be focused on doing whatever I can to protect Oregonians from military intervention or harmful federal law enforcement tactics. Oregon is united against military policing in our communities.”

A Trump-appointed federal judge has temporarily blocked a deployment to Oregon, which was meant to respond to protests at Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings, while a lawsuit plays out. But a Chicago-based judge appointed by former President Joe Biden declined to immediately halt the Illinois mobilization in a Monday afternoon hearing.

The Trump administration has argued that protests outside of ICE facilities necessitate additional security, while city and state officials have said the demonstrations are largely peaceful and expressed concern that soldiers could escalate tensions.

Hearst Newspapers reached out to top Texas leaders, local officials and the state’s entire congressional delegation to ask whether they support the deployment of the Texas National Guard in this case. Read their responses below.

...

President Trump does not have the authority to deploy the Texas National Guard other than under specific circumstances: invasion, rebellion, or if 'the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.' There is simply no evidence that is the case now in any state in the United States. It is utterly inconsistent with the principles of freedom and self-determination that Texans celebrate for Governor Abbott to go along with weaponization and attempted politicization of the United States military against our fellow Americans. I urge Governor Abbott not to support the deployment of Texas National Guard to Oregon or to any other state for domestic policing purposes, especially as our Texas National Guard is still assisting in the ongoing recovery and relief efforts in the Hill Country and is needed here at home.

“Exposure is not something that ICE wants,” Tim McOsker, a Los Angeles City Council member whose district covers Terminal Island, explained to me in a phone call.
From there, Trebach was moved to a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles, where she was held until later the next day.
“By the time our police officers arrived out there, everybody was gone.” The incident highlights the hollowness of the anti-Trump rhetoric of local politicians in Los Angeles.
There are masked men riding around my town trying to kidnap people.” This ethos harks back to another era of resistance in the Los Angeles harbor.","Back in June, Chiland, a Los Angeles public-school teacher, heard rumors that National Guard troops were being marshalled on Terminal Island in preparation to arrest anti-ICE demonstrators across the city. This inspired Chiland and his wife, Maya Suzuki Daniels, to co-found the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, a group of community activists that track the movements of immigration authorities around Los Angeles. “I came down here to check on that, because we wanted to let people know,” Chiland told me. He didn’t find any National Guard members that day, but “what I did see was a convoy of eleven vehicles”—some labelled Border Patrol, others unmarked, with tinted windows—leaving the federal complex and heading for the city. The next morning, another member of the newly established Peace Patrol returned to check if the Border Patrol convoys were back. They were. “We’ve been seeing them every day since,” he said. Today was day ninety-one.

By six-thirty, the Peace Patrollers were standing along the shoulder of Seaside Avenue. Maldonado, a Los Angeles-area workers-compensation hearing representative, distributed green reflective vests (“so they can’t say they didn’t see us”), and the group got to work. Four of the Patrollers whipped out their cellphones to photograph each passing vehicle, while Chiland managed the Peace Patrol’s Instagram account—a vital tool for broadcasting information and communicating with the public. Maldonado held tally clickers in each hand (one for inbound traffic to the federal complex, one for outbound) and counted the flow of vehicles. “We’ll get around a hundred to a hundred and thirty cars per day,” he told me. An S.U.V. and a sedan drove by. Click. Click. “If we get an influx of cars, that lets me know that there’s a lot of activity going on in L.A.” The busiest day since the Patrol started recording was in August, when three hundred and five vehicles passed through. He laughed: “We’ll tell our grandkids that we defeated fascism with six-dollar clickers.”

With the images they capture at Terminal Island, the Peace Patrol and Unión del Barrio, an affiliated community-activist organization, compare vehicles with those that appear at immigration raids throughout the region. Some vehicles logged at Terminal Island by the group have been spotted as far away as Ventura, and even Sacramento. Once a license plate has been confirmed as that of a federal agent by appearing both at Terminal Island and at an immigration-enforcement raid, the Peace Patrol will post an image of the plate and the vehicle to the group’s Instagram account. In a few instances, “we’ve seen one license plate on two different vehicles,” Maldonado said. Other times, a temporary paper license plate has been used to obscure known plates.

“Exposure is not something that ICE wants,” Tim McOsker, a Los Angeles City Council member whose district covers Terminal Island, explained to me in a phone call. McOsker has been a valuable resource for the Patrollers, and his wife has volunteered with the group. “When you are engaged in a systematic, unconstitutional activity where you’re trying to grab as many people in your net as possible, you do not want cameras.” The agents flowing through Terminal Island seem to agree. According to the Peace Patrol, after three months and dozens of confirmed vehicles and plates, certain cars are known to the Patrollers and have nicknames, like Christopher Columbus, Big Red, and Jammer. The federal agents have become aware of the Patrollers, too. Some agents will attempt to hide their faces as they pass—what the patrollers have dubbed the shy shoulder. Others will try to disguise their unmarked cars with things like a “COEXIST” bumper sticker (nickname: “Captain Coexist”) or Teddy bears on the dashboard. Still others will get aggressive. “We’ve been swerved at, we’ve had cars rip down the street at seventy, eighty miles per hour,” said Cait Bartlett, another former L.A. public-school teacher. Not long after, a large pickup truck known to the group rolled by, its horn blaring at the patrollers as the driver flashed his middle finger. “They’re trying to be intimidating,” Bartlett continued. “So, there is a little bit of nervousness attached to it, but I know the work that we’re doing is important.”

A month earlier, that intimidation had boiled over. On the morning of August 8th, two masked men leaving the federal complex exited their vehicle and targeted one of the Patrollers, Amanda Trebach, who was photographing cars and holding a protest sign. She was pinned to the ground, handcuffed, and thrown into a van. Then, as Trebach recounts, the agents drove her into the complex, where she was detained for several hours. Later, she was moved into a second vehicle by masked, armed men (including one of the men who had arrested her), where a special agent from the Department of Homeland Security questioned her. From there, Trebach was moved to a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles, where she was held until later the next day.

When reached for comment, Tricia McLaughlin, the D.H.S. Assistant Secretary for public affairs, alleged that Trebach jumped in front of a Border Patrol vehicle leaving the federal complex, causing the driver to swerve, then “hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents.” McLaughlin further alleged that Trebach blocked agents of Customs and Border Protection from carrying out their duties, and that led to her arrest. (Trebach has not been charged with a crime.)

“None of that happened,” Trebach told me, when reached by phone. D.H.S. is “very frustrated and angry that we’re out there filming them, but we’re standing on public property.” She also said that her cellphone was confiscated while in detention, and it remains in the possession of D.H.S. As a result, Trebach, an I.C.U. nurse, worries about the additional personal information that agents may have accessed and could use to continue targeting her. “I’m scared every night when I come home that they’re going to take me away,” she said.

For Suzuki Daniels, the Peace Patrol co-founder, video of Trebach’s arrest is still challenging to watch. “I have a physical reaction to it,” she said. “The only reason that it’s not getting national outcry is that, right now, we’re being inundated with so many crimes in our communities and across the United States. I think we’re kind of stunned, and in a freeze-trauma response.”

Roughly two hours after Trebach was taken away, a group of masked agents returned to her unlocked car, rummaged through her belongings, “and held three of our Patrollers at gunpoint,” Maldonado, who was present that morning, recalled. In the Peace Patrol’s video of the confrontation, a Port Police cruiser is visible passing by, twice. Maldonado still doesn’t understand why they didn’t stop and intervene: “The federal agents never identified themselves. They’re masked. You don’t know if they’re vigilantes. You don’t know who they are. Port Police just cruised by and pretended they didn’t see it at all.”

I reached out to Thomas Gazsi, the chief of the Los Angeles Port Police, about the incident, and about the role of his department in upholding the rights of the Peace Patrollers to assemble on a public road. Gazsi confirmed that someone from his department was present the morning Trebach was detained, but clarified that it was a port-security civilian officer, not a police officer. Still, should the security officer have, at the very least, stopped to witness the incident with the gunmen, and called it in to the department? “She reported to her supervisors, which was reported to our department,” Gazsi responded. “By the time our police officers arrived out there, everybody was gone.”

The incident highlights the hollowness of the anti-Trump rhetoric of local politicians in Los Angeles. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, has repeatedly decried the federal government’s incursion into the city (calling it an “assault” and “un-American”), and saying ICE’s relentless immigration raids are a “reign of terror” that must end. In July, she issued an executive directive that bolstered a 2017 city ordinance prohibiting city resources, including the L.A.P.D., from being used in immigration-enforcement activities, “unless required by federal or state law.” Yet, in multiple videos supplied to me by Unión del Barrio, the L.A.P.D. is present at immigration-enforcement activities, not impeding the federal agents but in what appears to be an accessory role.

In a video from June 24th, immigration agents are seen actively detaining individuals on the street, while L.A.P.D. officers stand in front of them, hands perched over their gun holsters or wielding batons, as they push back a crowd that has formed to intervene. In another video, from August 13th, an L.A.P.D. officer stands a few yards from an active Homeland Security Investigations operation as a person off camera asks “why L.A.P.D. is working with Homeland Security.” The officer responds that L.A.P.D. “provides security” for the agency, and that the department has worked with H.S.I. on “many occasions.”

This difference between what politicians promise and what actually happens has become more pronounced, of late, for anyone aligned with the Democratic Party. For Suzuki Daniels, the failure of Democrats to stand up against rising right-wing authoritarianism has left her feeling jaded about the entire political system. “No politician is going to save us,” she said. After years of canvassing for political candidates, signing petitions, and making phone calls for campaigns, “everything I do for the next four years is going to be direct action and mutual aid,” she said. “I am not pleading with politicians to save me or save the people I care about. There are masked men riding around my town trying to kidnap people.”

This ethos harks back to another era of resistance in the Los Angeles harbor. Back on Terminal Island, a little after 7 A.M., Gina, another member of the group, who declined to give her last name, asked if she could show me the statue in the middle of the Japanese fishing-village memorial. She told me that her grandfather had been a Sicilian immigrant who fished in San Pedro Bay, and that he had learned how to catch tuna with longline poles—a technique introduced by Japanese immigrants, many of whom had lived on Terminal Island. During the Second World War, as the U.S. government razed Furusato, “there was a lot of protection” from the non-Japanese community, Gina, said. “There was a lot of backlash, because what [the government] did was such a dirty thing.” She choked up as she continued, “This is white supremacy, once again, trying to take a foothold—it’s full fascism. Just like what happened to the Japanese Americans.” She turned to show me the statue of two Japanese fishermen, one looking out at Los Angeles, the other staring back at the federal complex, “watching them come and go,” as if they were part of their own peace patrol. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68d2e1a1d84c9f738cea23e0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Tomas_ICE_bleed.png",N,,2025-10-07 16:58:53.739609

The suit — which was filed by the newsroom Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club, local labor unions representing Chicago-area journalists and a group of individual journalist and protesters — lists specific incidents in which they say agents targeted the press, including instances where they allege six journalists were hit with either pepper balls or tear gas despite wearing visible press credentials.

They also list eight examples of protesters and residents who they said were harmed or injured by ICE officers’ “violent presence” — including a minister for a local Presbyterian Church who allegedly was struck by the pepper balls and sprayed with tear gas while trying to offer prayers to the crowd.

Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility and federal agents fired tear gas.","CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois leaders went to court Monday to stop President Donald Trump from sending National Guard troops to Chicago, escalating a clash between Democratic-led states and the Republican administration during an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation’s third-largest city.

The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

The lawsuit in Chicago also raised the stakes after a violent weekend: Authorities said a woman was shot by a federal agent when Border Patrol vehicles were boxed in and struck by other vehicles. The city’s police superintendent rejected suggestions that his officers were on the government’s side in volatile situations like that one.

The Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its crackdown on illegal immigration. Officials in Illinois and Oregon say military intervention isn’t needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.

The lawsuit alleges that “these advances in President Trump’s long-declared ‘War’ on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said a court hearing was scheduled for Thursday.

“Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation’s cities,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said.

Governor: Federal wave is an ‘invasion’

Pritzker said some 300 of the state’s guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to Chicago, along with 400 others from Texas.

Pritzker said the potential deployment amounted to “Trump’s invasion,” and he called on Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to block it. Abbott pushed back and said the crackdown was needed to protect federal workers who are in the city as part of the president’s increased immigration enforcement.

Abbott posted a picture on the social platform X on Monday night of Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, but didn’t specify where they were going.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed in a weekend statement that Trump authorized using Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness” that local leaders have not quelled.

The sight of armed Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous landmarks amplified concerns from Chicagoans already uneasy after an immigration crackdown that began last month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Monday that he signed an executive order barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations.

Mayor limits protest hours at ICE site

Protesters have frequently rallied near an immigration facility outside the city, and federal officials reported the arrests of 13 protesters Friday near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview. Mayor Katrina Thompson, citing safety and other factors, said she was limiting protests to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The ACLU of Illinois on Monday sued Trump, Department of Homeland Security, ICE, Border Patrol and national and local leaders at several agencies, accusing them of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside that facility. The lawsuit alleges that federal agents used “indiscriminate” and “violent force,” including tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and flash grenades, interfering with First Amendment rights.

DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the lawsuit that “the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting.”

Elsewhere, DHS acknowledged that agents shot a woman Saturday on Chicago’s southwest side. The department said it happened after Border Patrol agents patrolling the area were “rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said it’s reasonable for agents to use force if they believe they’re being ambushed. He noted officers were redeployed from other parts of the city to assist the agents and that 27 were affected by tear gas.

“We cannot become a society where we just decide to take everything in our own hands and start to commit crimes against law enforcement,” Snelling said.

He said it’s difficult to “toe the line” between not helping federal immigration agents and maintaining public safety.

Portland says no crime crisis there

In Portland, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order sought by Oregon and California barring the deployment of Guard troops to Oregon from any state and the District of Columbia.

Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, seemed incredulous that the president moved to send National Guard troops to Oregon from neighboring California and then from Texas on Sunday, just hours after she had ruled against it the first time.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she said. “Why is this appropriate?”

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt criticized the decision and said the president was using his authority as commander in chief.

Portland’s ICE facility has been the site of nightly protests for months, peaking in June when Portland police declared a riot, with smaller clashes occurring since then.

In recent weeks, the nightly protests typically drew a couple dozen people — until Trump ordered the National Guard. Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility and federal agents fired tear gas. Portland police made multiple arrests.

Since June, federal agents have charged 30 people with federal crimes related to the protests at the ICE building, including assaulting federal officers, failure to comply and depredation of government property, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon said Monday.

Most violent crime around the U.S. has declined in recent years, including in Portland, where homicides from January through June decreased by 51% to 17 this year compared to the same period in 2024, data shows.

Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

A federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.

Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general.
Like Mr. Sauer, he was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia.
Mr. Mooppan was a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration.
The pace has been frantic — Mr. Sauer has made more than two dozen requests for emergency relief — and it appears unlikely to slow anytime soon.
The court has said that it will also consider whether Mr. Trump can fire heads of independent agencies.","The prime players in Tuesday’s argument are lawyers for the State of Colorado and the Christian therapist suing over its conversion therapy law. But D. John Sauer, the solicitor general for the Trump administration, also requested that his office be allowed to participate in the arguments in support of the therapist, Kaley Chiles.

Mr. Sauer’s office has been on winning streak in front of the Supreme Court. He first broke onto the national scene with what seemed like an audacious argument: A former president could be immune from criminal prosecution even if he ordered a team of Navy SEALs to kill a political rival.

When asked by a federal appeals court, he accepted that premise that former presidents could not be criminally prosecuted for actions they took in office. He won that case before the Supreme Court in July 2024, with a majority of the justices granting Donald J. Trump substantial immunity from prosecution before he was re-elected president.

Now, Mr. Sauer, a former Rhodes Scholar and Supreme Court clerk from Missouri, is the solicitor general of the United States, the voice of the Trump administration before the justices.

In his role, Mr. Sauer leads a group of lawyers within the Justice Department who decide which cases to bring before the justices on behalf of the Trump administration, shape the administration’s legal arguments and argue the cases before the court.

Tuesday’s case is being argued by Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general. Like Mr. Sauer, he was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. Mooppan was a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration.

Mr. Sauer’s path to the second Trump administration ran through Missouri, where he served as solicitor general from 2017 to 2023 before working at a private firm. He gained a reputation as a particularly assertive litigator for conservative causes, including the opposition of same-sex marriage, access to contraception and the participation of transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports.

Since his confirmation, Mr. Sauer has been at the center of a whirlwind of litigation before the justices, defending Trump administration policies on several central pieces of the president’s agenda, including imposing tariffs, ending birthright citizenship and dismantling federal agencies. The pace has been frantic — Mr. Sauer has made more than two dozen requests for emergency relief — and it appears unlikely to slow anytime soon.

So far, his office has an extraordinary track record of victories, including a 6-to-3 ruling in late June that sharply curtailed the power of federal trial court judges to issue nationwide freezes on administration policies — the main tool that opponents had used to block the president’s agenda.

Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January and began issuing a blitz of presidential orders, Mr. Sauer has largely been arguing for emergency intervention by the Supreme Court, asking that the justices overturn temporary procedural rulings from lower court judges as opposed to weighing in on the substance of the policies.

This term, the solicitor general will marshal arguments directly on the merits of some of the president’s central policies, including whether a president can impose sweeping global tariffs — a case that has been fast-tracked by the court and is scheduled to be heard in November. The court has said that it will also consider whether Mr. Trump can fire heads of independent agencies.

In late September, Mr. Sauer also asked the justices to decide whether Mr. Trump has the authority to end birthright citizenship, the foundational principle stipulating that children born on U.S. soil are Americans.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07scotus-conversion-therapy-sauer-fhbm/07scotus-conversion-therapy-sauer-fhbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:59:10.859967

Here's what Americans say in new poll - Miami Herald,Brendan Rascius,,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article312414392.html,"In the survey, most respondents said they believe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have wrongly arrested U.S. citizens and half describe their tactics as too forceful.
Most Democrats and independents — 89% and 62%, respectively — said ICE agents arrest U.S. citizens often or sometimes, while 57% of Republicans said this happens rarely or not at all.
“We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
“Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.” Is ICE targeting criminals?
ICE tactics Lastly, respondents were asked to describe the tactics being used by ICE agents.","On the 2024 campaign trail, President Donald Trump vowed to launch what he called the “largest deportation program in American history.”

Now — nearly one year after his election — many Americans are uneasy with how this pledge is being pursued, expressing concerns about the scale and intensity of Trump’s immigration crackdown, according to a new YouGov poll.

In the survey, most respondents said they believe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have wrongly arrested U.S. citizens and half describe their tactics as too forceful.

It comes as ICE arrests have dramatically increased in recent months and as a record-breaking number of people have been placed in detention centers, according to an analysis from NBC News.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in September that 400,000 non-citizens have been deported since January, with 1.6 million more having self-deported, putting the administration on pace to “shatter historic records.”

Many Republicans have applauded the immigration crackdown, crediting Trump with following through with his campaign promises. House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X, “House Republicans are united behind our brave ICE officers and all those on the frontlines of the largest deportation effort in history.”

Meanwhile, numerous Democrats have attacked recent enforcement measures, with Rep. Rashida Tlaib accusing ICE of “ripping people out of the arms of their family members, terrorizing our communities, and turning our country into a fascist police state.”

ICE arresting US citizens

In the poll — which sampled 2,295 U.S. adults on Oct. 6 — respondents were asked: “How often do you think ICE wrongly arrests U.S. citizens?”

A majority, 60%, said immigration agents arrest American citizens often (35%) or sometimes (25%). Half that share said they detain citizens rarely (24%) or never (6%). An additional 11% said they were not sure.

This question resulted in a significant partisan divide. Most Democrats and independents — 89% and 62%, respectively — said ICE agents arrest U.S. citizens often or sometimes, while 57% of Republicans said this happens rarely or not at all.

Since January, at least 15 American citizens have been apprehended by ICE, with some being swept away by masked agents and detained for hours, according to a September analysis by the New York Times. This figure represents a small fraction of overall detentions, though the exact number is difficult to determine since the government does not release data on such encounters.

DHS described this report as false and misleading.

“We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.”

Is ICE targeting criminals?

The YouGov poll — which has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points — also asked respondents: “Do you think most immigrants being arrested by ICE are people who have committed crimes beyond entering or staying in the country illegally?”

A plurality, 48%, said that they believed most of those arrested have not committed other crimes, while 29% said they have. Twenty-three percent said they were not sure.

Here, again, there were massive differences across the political spectrum.

Most Democrats and independents — 76% and 51%, respectively — said the majority of those apprehended haven’t committed crimes aside from entering the U.S. illegally. Fifty-six percent of Republicans said they had violated the law in other ways.

Trump has vowed to deport “the worst of the worst,” with a focus on “dangerous criminals,” including murderers and rapists. But, government detention data paints a different picture.

As of late June, about 58,000 people were in ICE detention facilities, according to the Associated Press. Of these individuals, 71.7% had not been convicted of a crime. About one-quarter of them had pending charges.

ICE tactics

Lastly, respondents were asked to describe the tactics being used by ICE agents.

Fifty percent said their methods are “too forceful,” while 25% said they are “about right” and 15% said they are “not forceful enough.” An additional 11% said they weren’t sure.

Most Democrats and independents — 84% and 52%, respectively — characterized ICE tactics as excessive. Meanwhile, a plurality of Republicans, 44%, said they are appropriate.

Across the country, ICE raids have sparked multiple reports of agents resorting to excessive force against detainees and bystanders, resulting in some lawsuits.

In September, an ICE officer was captured on video shoving a mother onto the floor of a courthouse in New York, according to CNN. She was hospitalized and the officer was “relieved of his current duties.”

In California, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen claimed he was tackled to the ground by ICE agents, resulting in broken bones and signs of brain injury, according to the Associated Press. He filed a $50 million lawsuit against the government.

In response, a DHS spokesperson accused him of impeding an ICE operation.

“If you lay a hand on our law enforcement, we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Sept. 19.

Each day, we’re seeing neighbors kidnapped from our streets, detained in unsafe and inhumane conditions, and deported without due process to countries they’ve never known.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s this: The more Americans see of this agenda, the less they like it. And the more immigrants tell their stories, the better people understand why they belong.

Over 15 percent of Americans are immigrants. If you live here, there’s a good chance you know one. Since the late 1800s, we’ve called on immigrants to work in industry, health care, hospitality, agriculture, and other essential jobs. Immigration is a core to our story about who we are.

Immigrants contribute greatly to our culture and economy. They work jobs, pay taxes, volunteer in churches and schools, support American sports teams, and eat American foods. In 2022, immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes — more than many big name corporations.

At the root of why immigrants come to this country is the promise of a better life — a better job, a better education for their children, a chance to reunite with family. It’s not an easy choice to pick up and leave, and the journey is often perilous. But it’s often the only choice for migrants facing violence, death threats, climate disasters, or extreme poverty.

Against all odds, on average a few million have made their way here each year for the past five years. And generally speaking, the American people want them here — over 60 percent of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s cruel treatment of immigrants.

It turns out that deporting people to unsafe “third countries” they’ve never been to, building concentration camps like Alligator Alcatraz, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and deputizing local and state police as immigration enforcement are all unpopular.

Immigrants without a criminal conviction now make up the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE. Yet the GOP’s Big Ugly Bill provided $170 billion to enact Trump’s unpopular mass deportation agenda.

Immigrant advocates like Jeanette Vizguerra are fighting back. The cost can be great — but the American people are listening.

Jeanette is a mother of four, an undocumented worker, and long-time immigrant rights activist currently in ICE detention despite having no criminal record. She founded the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition and, in 2017, was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, ICE agents detained Jeanette outside the Target store where she worked. She’s fighting her case in court, arguing that the Trump administration targeted her for her activism. Hundreds of union members, friends, and supporters have rallied outside the Aurora, Colorado detention center where she’s being held.

Also crucial to the movement are groups fighting immigration enforcement and detention. The Detention Watch Network works with local members across the nation to shut down detention facilities and block ICE expansion, urges lawmakers to cut enforcement and detention funding, and educates the public about the impact of immigration policy on ordinary people.

Both Jeanette and Detention Watch Network strive to shift from an immigration approach that emphasizes punishment to one built on dignity and freedom. Together, they’ve been awarded the 49th Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award by the Institute for Policy Studies, my organization, for their ongoing bravery and commitment to protecting our neighbors and loved ones.

The immigrant rights movement continues to fight for the human right to move and stay — and for dignified lives for all. And even with little support among mainstream politicians or the media, they’re making a huge impact in this dangerous time: Nearly 80 percent of Americans now say immigration is good for this country — a record high.

A Second Chance On The 2020 Immigration Rule The Trump administration’s new H-1B rule will likely incorporate elements of its unsuccessful 2020 regulation.
In December 2024, the Biden administration published a final H-1B rule that addressed some of the issues in the Trump administration’s rule.
After a judge blocked the October 2020 interim final H-1B rule, the Trump administration posted online (but did not publish) a “final rule” in mid-January, together with a Department of Labor memo.
A New Immigration Rule To Restrict Employment-Based Green Cards DHS will also propose a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants.","The Trump administration plans to publish a new H-1B rule expected to propose additional immigration restrictions on how employers use the visa and who qualifies for it. Shortly before the White House announced a $100,000 fee on many H-1B visa holders, the Department of Homeland Security published its regulatory agenda. The agenda includes a rule to change the H-1B visa category.

The summary for the upcoming rule “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program” states: “DHS will propose to reform the H-1B program by revising eligibility for cap exemptions, providing greater scrutiny for employers that have violated program requirements, and increasing oversight over third party placements, among other provisions. These changes are intended to improve the integrity of the H-1B nonimmigrant program and better protect U.S. workers’ wages and working conditions.” The regulatory notice lists December 2025 as a possible publication date for the rule.

H-1B temporary visas are important since they typically are the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work in the United States long term and eventually gain permanent residence (a green card). The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with a 20,000 exemption for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. At U.S. universities, international students account for 73% of full-time graduate students in electrical and computer engineering. Under U.S. law, in addition to government fees often exceeding $6,000, employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. Research indicates that H-1B visa holders are paid the same or higher salaries than U.S. workers with comparable levels of education and experience.

During Donald Trump’s first term, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services implemented policies that resulted in historically high H-1B denial rates, until lawsuits and a subsequent legal settlement led to the agency’s reversal of these practices. However, the Trump administration failed to publish a final rule to change the H-1B visa category. The rule was published late in the president’s term, on October 8, 2020, and a judge blocked the H-1B rule on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. By starting the process early in Trump’s second term, administration officials seeking to impose new H-1B restrictions hope to avoid the fate of their 2020 rule.

A Second Chance On The 2020 Immigration Rule

The Trump administration’s new H-1B rule will likely incorporate elements of its unsuccessful 2020 regulation. The rule published in October 2020 had two main goals: 1) To make it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to qualify for H-1B status, and 2) to prevent H-1B visa holders from working at customer sites.

In December 2024, the Biden administration published a final H-1B rule that addressed some of the issues in the Trump administration’s rule. However, Biden officials decided on those issues in ways the business community viewed more favorably.

In the first version of its rule, which was a proposed rule, the Biden administration used the phrase “directly related specific specialty,” stating a position must require “A U.S. baccalaureate or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty or its equivalent” to enter the occupation. That phrase also appeared in the Trump administration’s October 2020 rule and would have narrowed the positions considered specialty occupations.

After attorneys and companies warned that the wording would prevent many foreign-born professionals from working in America, the Biden administration modified that section in its final rule. Although DHS retained the ‘directly related’ requirement in the definition of ‘specialty occupation,’ it added language clarifying that “directly related means there is a logical connection between the degree or its equivalent, and the duties of the position.” DHS added, “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”

Kevin Miner of Fragomen noted at the time that the original language could have prevented adjudicators from allowing the H-1B category to account for emerging technologies and degree fields. “The final rule solves this concern by noting that ‘directly related’ just means that there is a ‘logical connection’ between the education and the H-1B role, which should help the H-1B category continue to evolve with technology and new kinds of jobs as they develop,” said Miner in an interview.

The Trump administration could revise this language to make it more restrictive. However, the Supreme Court decision to end Chevron deference (to federal agencies) may limit its ability to go beyond what the statute permits on this and other measures. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Loper Bright Enterprises et al. v. Raimondo: “The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous; Chevron is overruled.”

The Trump administration could revisit areas that employers supported in the Biden H-1B final rule. For example, employers and university groups favored the extension of “cap-gap” protection for international students to prevent disruptions to students’ status and work authorization. Employers and university groups also supported provisions in the final rule that allow more organizations to qualify as H-1B cap-exempt nonprofit research institutions and greater leeway for H-1B visa holders to become entrepreneurs.

The Biden final rule also eliminated the application of the “itinerary requirement” to H-1B visa holders working at different locations. Employers argued that requiring a detailed itinerary of where and how long an H-1B professional works conflicted with modern work practices.

Trump’s 2020 Immigration Rule Restricted H-1B Visa Holders Working At Customer Locations

For much of Donald Trump’s first term, Trump officials sought to make it infeasible for an employer to send an H-1B visa holder to work at a customer’s location. A 2018 “Contracts and Itineraries” memo imposed new H-1B restrictions. When companies wanted to send H-1B employees to work on customer sites, USCIS often limited the approval period, sometimes to a single day. (The October 2020 rule would have limited H-1B visa holders working on customer sites to approvals lasting only one year.) Court losses and a legal settlement led to the agency ending the practices.

In rulemaking, Trump officials attempted again to make working in H-1B status at a customer’s location far more challenging. They adopted a controversial definition of what qualified as an employer-employee relationship, changing the long-held Department of Labor meaning. After a judge blocked the October 2020 interim final H-1B rule, the Trump administration posted online (but did not publish) a “final rule” in mid-January, together with a Department of Labor memo.

Although the measures did not take effect, attorneys argue that they represented a radical interpretation of labor and immigration law. Trump officials believed they could prevent companies from employing H-1B professionals who fulfill contracts at customer locations by shifting the legal obligations onto customers. In January 2021, via the unpublished final H-1B rule and DOL memo, the Trump administration sought to require not only information technology and professional services companies to submit H-1B petitions and labor condition applications but also their customers. That would have made the customers, in effect, employers of the H-1B visa holders rather than the recipients of services.

To give a mundane example, picture a landscaping company telling a homeowner they need to assume immigration obligations for the company’s employees who mow the homeowner’s lawn or trim the bushes. Few, if any, customers will assume immigration or other legal obligations for individuals they cannot hire or fire.

The Trump administration’s rule blocking IT and other services at customer sites would have affected not only suppliers but also the companies that receive services. A similar provision in a future rule could also affect productivity. University of California-Davis’ Giovanni Peri and Kevin Shih and Colgate University’s Chad Sparber concluded that the presence of foreign STEM workers accounts for approximately 30% to 50% of the aggregate productivity growth in the United States between 1990 and 2010. A percentage point increase in the share of foreign STEM workers in a city's employment mix “increased the wage growth of native college-educated labor by about 7 to 8 percentage points,” according to the research.

According to industry experts, IT services provided today, particularly those delivered by more established companies, are specialized and often involve substantial contracts worth several hundred million dollars or even $1 billion. The contracts typically provide skills, services or knowledge that U.S. companies do not possess in-house, or that may not make practical or financial sense to staff in-house, particularly for project-oriented work. Examples include incorporating AI throughout a healthcare provider’s network, providing technical support for a clothing company’s hardware and software across multiple platforms and initiating digital solutions to improve the operations of a pharmaceutical company.

Analysts note that by entering into expensive contracts to receive these services, companies demonstrate that they view these expenditures as necessary to compete, which means they improve the productivity of U.S. companies. H-1B visa holders are not the only professionals to service these contracts, but industry experts consider these types of technical services essential, given how the U.S. and global economy function today. (In FY 2025, there were entries for 442,000 unique beneficiaries in the H-1B registration process, according to DHS, which indicates that if no major companies that provide information technology services had received approved new H-1B petitions in FY 2025 as in previous years, the agency still would not have selected more than 300,000 H-1B beneficiaries due to the 85,000 annual limit. That indicates the most significant problem in the H-1B category for employers seeking high-skilled foreign nationals is the low yearly limit relative to the demand in a technology-driven economy.)

A New Immigration Rule To Restrict Employment-Based Green Cards

DHS will also propose a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants. According to the abstract, the proposed rule will, among other things, “update provisions governing extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; modernize outdated provisions for individuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; clarify evidentiary requirements for first preference classifications, second preference national interest waiver classifications, and physicians of national and international renown.” The regulatory notice lists ​January 2026 as a possible publication date.

Attorneys believe the proposed rule may be the Trump administration’s opportunity to eliminate the Biden administration’s efforts to clarify and expand eligibility for O-1A visas and national interest waivers.

On January 21, 2022, the Biden administration announced new guidance that encouraged more employers and high-skilled foreign nationals to use the O-1A visa category and national interest waivers.

“O-1A [are for] individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry),” according to USCIS. Receiving a national interest waiver allows individuals and employers to avoid the costly and time-consuming PERM process when filing for an immigrant visa in the employment-based second preference category.

After the new guidance, O-1A applications rose from 7,710 in FY 2021 to 10,010 in FY 2023, and the approval rate remained above 90%. There is no annual limit on O-1A visas.

Receipts for national interest waiver requests increased by 51% from FY 2021 to FY 2022 (14,610 to 21,990), according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. For FY 2022 to FY 2023, receipts for national interest waiver requests rose by 81%, from 21,990 to 39,810, although the approval rate declined.

Efren Hernandez, until recently a supervisory policy analyst at USCIS and now the founder of EH3 Immigration Consulting, believes DHS may make it harder for individuals to qualify under the employment-based first preference, also known as EB-1. He pointed out in an interview that to demonstrate “extraordinary ability” under the EB-1 category, a green card applicant must “provide evidence of a one-time achievement (i.e., Pulitzer, Oscar, Olympic Medal)” or to meet at least 3 of 10 criteria, such as “evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media.” DHS could raise that bar, for example, by requiring an applicant to meet 5 of 10 criteria or not allowing reasonable alternatives in fields that don’t have annual awards or that match the examples USCIS cites.

In recent research, economists Exequiel Hernandez (UPENN Wharton School), Britta Glennon (UPENN and NBER) and Jens Friedmann (Erasmus University Rotterdam School of Management) concluded that the more restrictions a company encounters on hiring foreign-born talent, the more acquisitions it will subsequently make. “In terms of immigration policy, our findings challenge the narrative that constraining immigration creates more opportunities for native workers,” according to the authors. “An acquisition is a very strong, costly commitment—both in terms of the purchase price and in the organizational adjustments required to make such a transaction work. It is unlikely that firms would be responding to immigration restrictions through acquisitions unless the need for the foregone talent were real.”

Exequiel Hernandez said in an interview that the research shows policymakers harm U.S. competitiveness when they restrict high-skilled immigration. “I think the paper is one more drop in the ocean of evidence that high-skilled immigration policy in the U.S. cannot be based on the assumption that there’s a readily available pool of U.S.-born workers firms would hire if we restrict visas for foreign-born workers.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/687dbd442ceeab75a457a29e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-07 17:58:00.892479

As of October 6, 2025, federal courts remain open and are drawing on non-appropriated funds to continue operations. But the federal judiciary has warned that if it exhausts those funds, it may have to reduce operations to essential functions.

The Administrative Office of the US Courts released a statement indicating that existing funds will last until at least October 17. After that, should the shutdown remain in effect, impacts on the judicial system may grow and will likely vary by jurisdiction.

In prior shutdowns, disruptions were kept to a minimum, but that is because most shutdowns did not last significant amounts of time. During the 2018–19 shutdown (the longest in history, at 34 days), courts ultimately shifted to essential-only staffing, which caused additional delays at the district court level.

If this shutdown persists beyond mid-October and courts furlough non-essential staff, civil cases could similarly face broad delays as resources tighten.

For now, most litigants should expect business as usual in the nation’s courthouses, at least in private civil matters. The judiciary has not broadly paused proceedings or deadlines, and the electronic filing system is still operational.

However, parties in civil cases involving the federal government may see efforts from government lawyers to pause proceedings. Government counsel, representing federal agencies and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in civil cases, have been told to seek delays in most matters. It is within a court’s discretion to pause or delay proceedings, and we anticipate that a substantial percentage of such requests will be granted. If a court denies a request for a delay, federal parties will likely comply with that ruling, subject to staffing restraints from the shutdown. The federal government has indicated that it will not seek to delay criminal prosecutions or extraditions.

How courts react to the federal shutdown will vary on a district-by-district, and even judge-by-judge, basis. In the US District Court for the District of Columbia, for example, Chief Judge James Boasberg unilaterally extended all deadlines in civil cases involving government lawyers for the duration of the shutdown given the high volume of cases involving government attorneys.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15361_4613.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:59.835582

Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.

Trump signed legislation into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strongarm tactic — a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, now in the seventh day of a federal shutdown.

“That should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson at a press conference at the Capitol.

Johnson, a lawyer, said he hadn’t fully read the memo but “there are some legal analysts who are saying” that it may not be necessary or appropriate to repay the federal workers.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington blasted the Trump administration as defying the law.

“Another baseless attempt to try and scare & intimidate workers by an administration run by crooks and cowards,"" said Murray, who is the ranking lawmaker on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “The letter of the law is as plain as can be — federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.”

Refusing retroactive pay to the workers, some of whom must remain on the job as essential employees, would be a stark departure from norms and practices, and almost certainly would be met with legal action.

While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are most always reimbursed once government reopens.

In a single-page memo from Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russ Vought, first reported by Axios, the office's general counsel seeks to lay out a legal rationale for no backpay of federal workers.

The memo explains that while the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 says workers shall be paid after federal funding is restored, it argues the action is not self-executing. Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.

The OMB analysis draws on language familiar to budget experts by suggesting that the 2019 bill created an authorization to pay the federal workers, but not the actual appropriation.

Congress, it says, is able to decide whether it wants to pay the workers or not.

For now, Congress remains at a standstill, with neither side — nor the White House — appearing willing to budge. Democrats are fighting for health care funds to prevent a lapse in federal subsidies that threaten to send insurance rates skyrocketing. Republicans say the issue can be dealt with later.

A prominent face on the daily Palestinian solidarity demonstrations outside the Bourse, a major city square, Farajalah was arrested three months ago after one such protest and placed in immigration detention, according to activists.

Farajalah’s mother had recently died in Gaza, but he had been denied permission to leave the detention facility to mourn her, according four sources with knowledge of the situation, including Anas Hamam, a Moroccan detainee who had met Farajalah in the “127 Bis” detention center but was transferred to another facility a month ago.

How Farajalah’s mother passed remains unclear.

Hamam told The Intercept by phone, “He was such an incredible person, the kindest and the most thoughtful person who I ever met in that center.”

Around eight Palestinians are thought to have been held in Belgium’s detention camps, according to activists. Many were arrested by plainclothes police officers after Bourse demonstrations.

Last week, Amnesty International called for an investigation into Belgium’s harsh crackdowns on the protesters. Riot police had used tear gas and water cannons on demonstrators in Brussels against Israel’s interdiction of an aid flotilla to Gaza last week.

Belgium’s migration and asylum service confirmed Farajalah’s death, but spokesperson Dominique Ernould declined any further comment citing confidentiality and the privacy of the family.

“The situation is calm in the center,” Ernould said. “The necessary support is being provided to the center’s residents and staff members.”

Asylum Denied

Two sources, including Hamam and a pro-Palestine activist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said that Farajalah had recently had an asylum claim turned down.

“He didn’t have papers,” the activist said. “Belgium denied him access to international protection.”

As word of Farajalah’s death spread, Palestine solidarity organizers called for a protest of “fire, rage, noise” outside the detention center on Saturday.

“He had lost his mother,” organizers wrote on an Instagram post. “He had asked to be released so he could mourn. He had written. He had pleaded. The administration ignored him. The system crushed him. Silence killed him.”

A group calling itself “Getting the Voice Out” sent The Intercept a statement saying that other detainees in the facility were outraged by the death.

“They are starting a hunger strike at the center and have made a flag with his name on it,” the statement said. “They tell us, ‘Today it’s Mahmoud, tomorrow it’s someone else. Security is laughing at us. We have to do something.’”

Activists and a former detainee at “127 Bis” said people held there were routinely denied phone calls and internet access, among other charges.

Ernould, the migration authority spokesperson, denied claims by activists and Palestinian detainees — one of whom has talked to The Intercept — of mistreatment in the detention camps.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is expected to visit the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland on Tuesday. Noem's visit is the latest event in the Trump administration's ongoing push to send National Guard troops into Portland.

Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden strongly condemned Noem's visit.

""Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official,"" Wyden said in a statement to KGW. ""In reality, she's been sent by Trump to incite violence. Don't tar and feather her as Speaker Johnson suggested for Governor Newsom. The best response to her playacting as cop? Ignore her and keep supporting the members of our community.""

In a joint statement, the city of Portland and the Portland Police Bureau said they had been notified of Noem's visit, but had not received full details of her agenda.

""In the interest of public safety, Portland Police will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary,"" the city and PPB said in a statement. ""This protects our community, by making sure our roads and public spaces stay safe.""

In a social media post, PPB warned that roads may be impacted ""around the Portland area,"" with possible temporary closures in the South Waterfront. On Tuesday morning, officers blocked off a one-block radius around the ICE facility in South Waterfront to both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and could be heard on a loudspeaker warning people to back up.

The city and police statement reiterated that under Portland's sanctuary city status, local police will not assist with federal immigration enforcement activities.

""We urge Portlanders to continue to remain safe,"" the city and PPB said. ""Recent court decisions have affirmed that Portland does not need federal military intervention, and that our local public-safety approach stands on firm legal ground.""

The administration has argued that the troops are needed to help protect the ICE office in Portland's South Waterfront neighborhood, where for several months a small group of demonstrators has gathered outside, leading to occasional clashes with federal agents guarding the building. This week, President Donald Trump described the city as a ""burning hellhole."" Local officials have said the administration is grossly exaggerating the scale of the incidents.

Since nightly protests began in June, Portland police have made 37 arrests. The Portland FBI office said it has made 149 arrests, though many have not led to charges.

The Affirmative Litigation Section contemplates suits against states and municipalities that “interfere with or obstruct federal policies,” signaling potential expansion of federal challenges on topics ranging from immigration to health policy implementation.","On September 25, 2025, the Department of Justice announced a new office within the Civil Division—the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch—“dedicated to safeguarding public health and safety through proactive enforcement and high-impact affirmative litigation.”

The creation of this new office restructures and consolidates affirmative litigation into a specialized branch to “hold powerful actors accountable, protect public health and safety, and enforce critical national policies.”

What DOJ Is Changing

The Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch will house two sections:

The Enforcement Section will bring suits under a variety of statutes including the Controlled Substances Act, federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and Federal Trade Commission Act. The stated focus includes protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, defective consumer goods, and false or misleading claims about drugs and dietary supplements.

The Affirmative Litigation Section will bring suits “against states, municipalities, and private entities that interfere with or obstruct federal policies,” with the stated aim of ensuring nationwide compliance with the U.S. Constitution and federal law.

The creation of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch does not expand the Department’s statutory powers but reframes certain priorities that are likely to receive sustained attention under the current administration. It coincides with the winding down of the Consumer Protection Branch, with its civil affirmative work absorbed into the Enforcement Section, indicating that DOJ intends to centralize certain consumer protection matters.

Identified Priorities: Gender Transition and Immigration

The press release announcing the new Branch expressly identifies two priority areas:

Gender Transition: DOJ notes that the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch will “[protect] women and children” by targeting “pharmaceutical companies, health care providers, and medical associations profiting off of false and misleading claims related to so-called gender transition.”

Immigration: DOJ also highlights that the Branch will focus on ending sanctuary jurisdiction laws, policies, and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.

These priorities track with broader administration initiatives. For example, in Executive Order 14187 (Jan. 28, 2025), the White House directed DOJ to prioritize investigations and actions addressing alleged deception and FDCA violations concerning gender affirming care for minors. Related legislation was introduced in Congress on September 18, 2025. The legislation, H.R. 5483 and S. 2907, would codify Executive Order 14187.

Enforcement Context: Focus on FDA/HHS Actions on Drug Advertising

The DOJ announcement regarding the new Branch arrives alongside a visible pivot by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on pharmaceutical promotion. On September 9, 2025, FDA announced a “crackdown” on deceptive drug advertising, with particular attention to disclosures, social media influencer campaigns, and direct-to-consumer telehealth marketing. The same day, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission issued its Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy, urging increased interagency oversight of DTC advertising—explicitly citing FDA, HHS, FTC, and DOJ.

The DOJ announcement says little about the Affirmative Litigation Section, simply that entities interfering with or obstructing federal policies, or failing to comply with the U.S. Constitution or federal laws, should expect enforcement activity. The emphasis on litigation against states and municipalities indicates that the DOJ is seeking to enforce the administration’s policies nationwide. Whether this litigation will focus on gender transition, immigration, and discrimination, or whether it could be used to compel states to conform in other areas, remains to be seen.

Practical Takeaways for Health Care and Regulated Entities

Expect coordinated scrutiny on advertising and promotion. The creation of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch aligns with recent FDA/HHS actions earlier this month. Companies should reassess direct-to-consumer and influencer-driven campaigns, promotional claims, and risk disclosures, including those tied to telehealth marketing.

No expansion of statutory powers. The DOJ’s move does not expand statutory powers on its own; rather, it reorganizes how affirmative enforcement is prioritized and executed. The choice to centralize and name specific targets (g., gender transition and sanctuary policies) suggests both a legal and political through line. If pursued vigorously, expect litigation testing federalism boundaries, administrative law theories, and speech-related issues.

False Claims Act (FCA) risk remains elevated. Although the DOJ’s announcement regarding the new Branch does not expressly mention the FCA, its 2025 initiatives make clear that recipients of federal funds (health systems, plans, universities, contractors, and grantees) should assume ongoing emphasis on FCA enforcement, particularly where alleged civil rights or consumer protection issues intersect with federal dollars. DOJ has repeatedly stated that it will deploy the FCA against “entities that receive federal funds but knowingly violate civil rights laws” (June 20 blog post). DOJ also launched the new Civil Rights Fraud Initiative in May (May 22 blog post) and, in July, established an FCA Working Group focused on six priority areas in the health care space (July 3 blog post).

Potential state-federal collision. The Affirmative Litigation Section contemplates suits against states and municipalities that “interfere with or obstruct federal policies,” signaling potential expansion of federal challenges on topics ranging from immigration to health policy implementation.

But she warned that immigration levels were too high, adding that ""if people come in too quickly, it's impossible to integrate"".

She also defended remarks made by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick who said Handsworth in Birmingham was ""one of the worst-integrated places"" he had ever been to.

In a recording reportedly made in March during a dinner and published by the Guardian, the shadow justice secretary said he had not seen ""another white face"" in the hour and a half he spent in Handsworth filming a video about litter.

He went on: ""I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated.

""It's not about the colour of your skin, or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives.""

Asked about the comments, he told the BBC's Chris Mason: ""There are numerous parts of our country now where the same story is happening, and at the extreme levels, a lack of integration leads us into a very dark place as a country.

""We're here in Manchester today, a week on from a terrible terrorist attack where a man who lived in our country for 30 years clearly wasn't well integrated, clearly didn't share British values because he went on to murder British Jews.""

His earlier comments have provoked criticism from opposition politicians.

Badenoch defended his comments, and said they were made during the bin strike in Birmingham.

""Rubbish piled up in the streets and what were the politicians focusing on - airports in Pakistan and Gaza,"" she said.

""We need people to have their eyes focused on what is going on in this country.""

Badenoch told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason that immigration was something her party ""got wrong"" in government and that was why she was coming up with ""tougher"" policies including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to deport 750,000 illegal immigrants in five years.

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed on Monday, the media coalition highlights the threat posed by the White House’s decision earlier this year to exclude the AP from covering certain White House events after the news service chose not to follow President Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. The brief asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to affirm a lower-court ruling in favor of the AP, emphasizing the White House press pool’s historic function as an “independent chronicler of the presidency” that is essential to the free flow of information to the public about the nation’s highest office.

The White House presumably hopes that “under threat of retaliatory ejection, questioning will be friendlier — that outlets will face pressure to pull their punches, to gloss over mistakes or unartful remarks, to avoid pressing for answers,” the brief argues. “And were it to succeed, the core function of the pool — to offer a complete, candid record of the presidency — would atrophy.”

The brief is the latest showing of broad support for the AP among news and media organizations. In February, the Reporters Committee led a media coalition of more than 30 news organizations in sending a letter to the White House, which noted that “[a]ll news organizations covering the White House are negatively affected when one peer outlet is singled out in a manner that crosses a constitutional line.”

The Reporters Committee then filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the AP after the news service sued the White House in federal district court. In April, U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden sided with the news service and ordered the White House to re-admit AP journalists into the pool.

“[U]nder the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists — be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere — it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,” Judge McFadden wrote in his 41-page order. “The Constitution requires no less.”

That order has been stayed by the D.C. Circuit while the Trump administration’s full appeal is taken up by the appeals court.

The Prime Minister has referred to people recognised by the UK government as facing a real risk of persecution in their home country as having obtained a “golden ticket”. The government has made clear that it will not restore refugee family reunion rights in its previous form and has indicated that the current path to settlement for refugees may also be under threat.

This statement followed hot on the heels of an announcement by the Home Secretary of the introduction of a new “contribution-based settlement model” for those in the immigration system. There is not much new in the announcement which was trailed in the immigration white paper a few months ago. The lack of detail has caused a huge amount of concern with those potentially affected, in particular because the government continues to provide mixed messages about whether or not any changes will apply to those already here.

Last week the inquest into the death of Leonard Farruku on the Bibby Stockholm concluded that the move to the barge was not the reason for his death. However, unsurprisingly to those with any experience of Home Office safeguarding, the coroner also identified failings including a total lack of response by the Home Office to an email from Clearsprings raising urgent concerns about Mr Farruku’s mental health.

On Free Movement, in today’s post Ross Kennedy looks at the doubling in sponsor licence revocations over the past year and sets out what immigration lawyers need to understand about enforcement in this context. Last week we updated our briefing on Hamid hearings, to include some up to date examples including the recent case of the barrister who misused AI in an immigration appeal.

There were also case write ups including a successful challenge to certification of a human rights claim of a gay Indian man, meaning he will now be able to appeal the refusal. In another case, a grandmother deported from the UK over 20 years ago, whose family live in the UK, has lost her challenge to the refusal to revoke her deportation order.

Despite the short length of the court’s earlier order, “there was no need for speculation” about its reasons, Sauer claimed.
To Barrett, emergency docket decisions are rushed.
In another short decision in this case, the justices signaled that their emergency docket orders do sometimes control later stages of a dispute.
Justices Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the government’s request.","Immigration Matters is a recurring series by César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández that analyzes the court’s immigration docket, highlighting emerging legal questions about new policy and enforcement practices.

As the Supreme Court uses its emergency docket more frequently in disputes over high-profile policies, tension over the effect of decisions issued from that fast-paced process is brewing in public. Ten days after Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor publicly described the emergency docket’s limitations, the Justice Department took to the emergency docket in Noem v. National TPS Alliance to ask the court to treat a three-paragraph order as binding in a case over Biden-era legal protection from deportation for Venezuelans that the Trump administration is trying to end. On Friday, the court sided with the government.

Unlike cases that reach the court’s merits docket, which involve lengthy fact-finding and legal argumentation over years, emergency docket cases move relatively quickly. Often, the court issues a decision within months of the lawsuit being filed in a federal district court. Most emergency docket decisions are short pronouncements. Since they often focus on a specific procedural matter, it isn’t unusual for the justices to recycle sentences and fail to explain their reasoning.

Issuing a decision quickly is valuable, but it comes at a cost. Last month, Barrett explained the downside of the emergency docket’s truncated decision-making process. “There’s no opportunity for percolation” of legal arguments in the lower courts, she told Sarah Isgur from SCOTUSblog and David French of The New York Times in an interview on the Advisory Opinions podcast (published by The Dispatch, which owns SCOTUSblog). “We might be writing sooner than we want to be or with less information than we want to be,” Barrett added. To get a decision out quickly, the justices can’t hear multiple perspectives on the legal issues as they normally do for cases on the court’s merits docket. “You don’t have the time to go back and forth if you’re actually going to dispose of these things quickly,” Barrett explained.

Appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” in early September, Sotomayor explained the importance of written opinions, which certainly applies in the context of the emergency docket. Sotomayor noted that persuasion is the court’s only weapon, and written opinions are how the court tries to persuade the public. “We don’t have the power of the purse, so we can’t threaten people with money. We don’t have an army,” she said. “We have the power of persuasion and so we write in the hopes of convincing all of you, the public, that there’s a reason for why we’re ruling the way we are.”

After the justices issue their written opinions, Barrett and Sotomayor have each suggested that the public needs to do its part to inform itself. “Read the opinion,” Barrett said in 2022. Echoing her last month, Sotomayor stated, “read the decisions.” Responding to Colbert’s questions, Sotomayor said that orders in which the justices don’t provide their reasoning don’t have the same effect as decisions in which the justices explain themselves. When the court doesn’t explain its reasoning, an emergency docket order “doesn’t control,” Sotomayor said.

Recent litigation over legal protections for citizens of Venezuela illustrates the emergency docket’s speed and the lack of explanation in its rulings. In National TPS Alliance v. Noem, a group of Venezuelans who had been granted Temporary Protected Status, along with an organization that advocates on behalf of TPS recipients, sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Feb. 19, claiming that she failed to follow the required procedures to terminate their legal authorization to live in the United States.

A federal district court agreed on March 31, concluding that Noem likely violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution’s equal protection clause. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit refused, less than a month later, to put the district court’s order on hold while the government appealed, the Justice Department turned to the emergency docket on May 1 to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Three months after the lawsuit began, on May 19, the justices granted the government’s request, pausing the district court’s order.

As is common in emergency docket decisions, the justices did not explain why they put the lower court’s order on hold. The court’s decision includes six sentences spread across three paragraphs. One of those paragraphs consists of a single sentence noting that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed with her colleagues, but it does not say why. Another paragraph consists of four sentences, three of which describe the process by which the case reached the court’s emergency docket or the process that will follow. This generic process explanation is identical to statements made in other emergency docket orders.

Only the remaining paragraph, which consists of one sentence, refers to the specific legal issue at stake in the case. Even then, the justices don’t address their reasoning. The justices noted that their order shouldn’t “prejudice” any legal challenge to Noem’s attempt to strip Venezuelans of work permits and legal authorization to continue living in the United States. Except for Jackson, we can’t even be sure whether all the justices voted with the majority.

Since the Supreme Court issued its decision in May, the legal fight over TPS has returned to the lower federal courts. In a 69-page opinion issued in September, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen noted that the Supreme Court “did not provide any specific rationale for its decision” but did permit the legal challenge over the required procedure to move forward. For that reason, Chen described in detail Noem’s decision-making process, then concluded that she failed to comply with federal law. Chen ordered Noem to postpone the decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the government’s request to pause Chen’s order, prompting the Justice Department to again request intervention by the Supreme Court.

In its ongoing legal fight to end TPS for Venezuelans, the Justice Department prompted the justices to downplay Barrett’s worry about the front end of the emergency docket process and disagree with Sotomayor’s claim about its future impact. Since the court had already blocked implementation of the lower court’s decision once, it should do so again, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the government’s most recent request to the Supreme Court in this case. Despite the short length of the court’s earlier order, “there was no need for speculation” about its reasons, Sauer claimed. The justices “evidently concluded that the government was likely to succeed,” he added. For that reason, the court’s prior order “squarely controlled” the current round of litigation, Sauer wrote. The 9th Circuit’s refusal to stay Chen’s September order was “indefensible” and a “needless afront to stare decisis,” the principle that courts should follow earlier rulings about similar legal issues, Sauer added.

Sauer’s application to stay Chen’s order invited the justices to clarify what to make of the typical emergency docket decision. Should lower courts and lawyers assume that decisions are meant to have lasting impact even if they number no more than a handful of sentences? To Barrett, emergency docket decisions are rushed. To Sotomayor, decisions in which the justices don’t explain their reasoning, as is true in National TPS Alliance, should have limited influence on future legal proceedings.

In another short decision in this case, the justices signaled that their emergency docket orders do sometimes control later stages of a dispute. The majority decision, released late Friday, numbers three paragraphs, most of which recite basic facts about the process this case has followed. In two sentences of one three-sentence paragraph, the majority announced that they see little difference in the strength of arguments made by the parties now and in May. Since “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not” changed, the majority announced, “[t]he same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.” They did not explain why.

As is common in emergency docket cases, the majority opinion is unsigned. Justices Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the government’s request. Writing for herself, Jackson lamented the majority’s willingness to use its power to contradict “reasoned and thoughtful written opinions” by lower court judges while failing to write an opinion explaining themselves. Neither Sotomayor nor Kagan explained their reasoning.

Having agreed with the Justice Department despite the concerns that Sotomayor and Barrett raised, the court has once again put lower courts and lawyers in a position to attempt to divine meaning out of sparse text. And instead of reading thoughtful reasoning, as Barrett and Sotomayor implore, it has left ordinary people to read the judicial equivalent of tea leaves. Neither is likely to help courts, lawyers, or the public make sense of why the court does what it does.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 11:58:05.904707

Who controls the National Guard?
The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.
""As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,"" she wrote Saturday in her order.
It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy guard members there.","President Trump is bucking tradition and legal precedent in pushing to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities such as Portland, Ore., and Chicago due to what he says is rampant crime and to support his crackdown on illegal immigration.

On Monday, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to the state — arguing that the administration has exceeded its authority under Title 10, the statute that allows the president to bring the guard into federal service.

Legal experts say Trump is testing the limits of presidential authority by using the rarely used statute to deploy federal troops to American cities without state approval. And the legal tactic is getting mixed results in federal court.

Oregon and Portland officials successfully delayed efforts to send troops there. But by Monday evening, a federal judge in Illinois declined the request to immediately block the deployment.

Portland and Chicago are just two of the latest cities where Trump has threatened to send troops. He sent hundreds of troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer and the National Guard has also been ordered to Memphis — a move supported by Tennessee's Republican governor.

Who controls the National Guard?

The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.

""State active duty"" is when troops are under state command and state funded. Title 32 — which is how the guard is being deployed in Memphis — is when troops are under state command but federally funded. Then, there's Title 10, which is when guard members are both federally controlled and funded.

According to the provision, the president can deploy the National Guard into federal service when the county is under an invasion, a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or the president is unable with the ""regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.""

In federal court, the Trump administration has claimed that it is unable to ""execute the laws of the United States"" as it relates to immigration enforcement due to protests in these cities.

""This law hasn't been used in this way before, by any previous president,"" said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.

Generally, the National Guard has been federalized and deployed domestically to respond to civil unrest in extreme circumstances, where state and local law enforcement were completely overwhelmed, Goitein said.

Critics of the troop deployments argue that the situations in Portland and Chicago do not rise to the level of a rebellion. They also say that for troops to be federalized, their governor of each state still needs to approve a Title 10 order.

Goitein said, ""It's not about whether the federal government should have this authority at all. It's about whether the federal government should be able to use these authorities based on what really appear to be completely contrived claims about the situation on the ground.""

Could Trump use the Insurrection Act?

One way that a sitting president has deployed the guard domestically without a state's consent was through the Insurrection Act — a set of laws meant to address major civil unrest. It also allows federal troops to take part in law enforcement activities like searches and arrests.

It's only been invoked a handful of times in U.S. history, with the last instance being over 30 years ago during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

""For better or for worse, I think the insurrection Act has been a third rail politically for much of its history,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.

In his second term, Trump has floated the idea of using the Insurrection Act. On Monday, when asked by a reporter under what circumstances he would invoke it, Trump said, ""If people were being killed and courts were holding us or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that.""

Vladeck doesn't think Trump invoking the law is out of the question. He said, ""I think that the administration understands that that would be an even more dramatic escalation.""

How are courts responding?

For the most part, federal judges in California and Oregon have expressed wariness and skepticism over the troop deployments.

In California, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer, who has presided over the state's challenge to the guard deployment, strongly criticized the Trump administration over the move, calling it illegal and asserting that federal officials did not follow proper protocol for federalizing troops.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, however, has previously argued that ""a great level of deference"" had to be given to the president's assessment that a situation required military intervention.

In Oregon, after temporarily blocking the federalization of the state's National Guard members, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the facts just could not be supported that a military intervention was needed — even if deference was given.

""As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,"" she wrote Saturday in her order.

It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy guard members there. On Monday, U.S. District Judge April Perry declined to immediately block a troop deployment and gave the administration until the end of Wednesday to respond to the lawsuit filed by state and city officials.

Vladeck believes it will be up to the courts to check presidential authority on this issue.

And, he said, ""sooner or later"" the Supreme Court will have to weigh in on what circumstances support military intervention in American cities.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+209/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdc%2F85%2Fe6a5a9f0439d96e684ea464234ff%2Fgettyimages-2218877782.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:57:00.177950

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is challenging a Michigan Court of Appeals decision from last year that dismissed its case because the deadline to file had passed.

The lawsuit says the state has been improperly denying injured worker benefits to people without legal status.

“If we want work conditions that are dignified, fair and healthy, we must ensure that workers’ compensation system is administered as intended to protect all workers,” said MIRC attorney Anna Hill Galendez. “The reality is many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more.”

Part of MIRC’s case is the not-for-profit law firm must continue to expend resources filing workers' compensation lawsuits against the state.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s administration argues there was a one-year window to file a lawsuit or a notification that one was on the way and the plaintiffs missed that deadline. It argued in its brief asking the Supreme Court to refuse the case that it was complying with the law.

The new minister of education and higher education, Rima Karami, vowed to rehabilitate the Lebanese public school system and quality of education. In September, Prime Minster Salam said that “the children of Lebanon, regardless of origin or circumstance, must never be deprived of their right to learn.” Both have emphasized that education is a national priority needed to revitalize the country.

But in a disappointing move, on September 30, the government restricted access to education for many refugees. It continued last year’s mandate requiring that non-Lebanese students show valid residency permits or a valid ID issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to register for “second shift” classes in Lebanon’s public schools for the 2025-2026 school year. Generally, Palestinian refugee children, including those from Syria, attend UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools rather than public schools.

According to a spokesperson from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), last year at least 28,000 non-Lebanese children were effectively barred from public education because of the legal residency requirement.

While Lebanon initially maintained an open-door policy for Syrians seeking refuge, by 2015 the government began enacting stricter residency requirements and stringent criteria for renewal of residency permits. The red tape and high renewal fees have made it so only around 20 percent of Syrian refugees have valid residency status.

Anti-ICE demonstrations in Seattle have varied in size and have included peaceful gatherings as well as more aggressive, disruptive actions.

Portland's protests have tended to be smaller and more focused on one specific ICE facility in the southern part of the city, though groups of several hundred gathered occasionally. At times, these demonstrators have used barricades, caused property damage, set small fires, and clashed with federal officers. There has been occasional violence that has led to multiple arrests.

“We see that President Trump has been ignoring all the court rulings that have been happening, all the injunctions,” Mora-Cheung said. “I think it makes sense that people are extremely angry, to the point in which they want to be able to show some level of violence. It's pent up anger for a lot of people over these years of their system failing them.""

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump’s use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”

An expanding role for the National Guard not seen before

Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump’s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Control over a state’s National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor’s objections. Otherwise, it’s up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He’s called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America’s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America’s cities safer.

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,’” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it’s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy’s move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it’s more symbolic than helpful.”

Legal challenges set up a clash over Trump’s deployments

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge’s decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it’s the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump’s immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump’s opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power.

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That’s our backstop. That’s what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump’s attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge’s weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States.

Thompson's order limits protests outside the ICE facility at 1930 Beach Street and the designated protest area at 2000 S. 25th Av. to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

According to the order, the mayor decided to set a limit on protest times ""due to the recent escalation of violence by ICE"" outside the facility, including ""needlessly deploying tear gas, pepper spray, mace, and rubber bullets at individuals and reporters, thereby injuring Village residents, Village police officers, and Village firefighters.""

The mayor said the order is needed to balance the constitutional rights of protesters with the needs of Broadview residents and businesses.

""People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,"" said Thompson.

But the repeated clashes with ICE agents in our town are causing enormous disruptions in the quality of life for my residents whose rights I have taken an oath to protect. We live here. Our residents live here and deserve dignity and respect.""

CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller predicted, if the mayor's order faces a court challenge, it would be ruled unconstitutional.

""The First Amendment doesn't say it can only be done during business hours, and I think that that order will be struck down by a judge somewhere along the line, because it's clearly unconstitutional,"" he said.

Protests outside the ICE facility have repeatedly grown heated, with ICE agents firing projectiles and using tear gas at times.

Tensions between protesters and ICE agents have escalated multiple times in recent weeks. The majority of those clashes have taken place in the streets outside the ICE vehicles have been leaving or arriving at the facility, and protesters have tried to block their path.

On Thursday, state and local officials established a designated protest zone outside the ICE facility.

Illinois and Cook County officials said they have set up a temporary unified command to coordinate public safety efforts outside the ICE facility in Broadview.

Illinois State Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office, the Cook County Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency have set up designated areas for protesters outside the facility, while leaving the street open for vehicles.

Crews installed new concrete barriers Thursday night establishing the designated protest zones and restricted area outside the ICE facility.

""The goal of the Unified Command is to protect the health and safety of all individuals, including nearby Broadview residents and businesses, and enable the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights. The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,"" Illinois State Police said.

Thompson said that, on Saturday night, a ""very aggressive crowd of protesters"" got out of control, and shut down 25th Avenue outside the ICE facility, and tried to block the nearby Eisenhower Expressway as well.

""We had over 60 state troopers helping and we had to seek additional assistance from other local police departments who rushed to Broadview to help. And Broadview residents had to suffer through that mayhem,"" Thompson said.

Demonstrators and residents express concerns over limited protest times during village board meeting

During a village board meeting on Monday evening, protestors and residents voiced their concerns, saying the order to protest between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. infringes on First Amendment rights. The mayor fired back, saying this is needed to help people who live in Broadview feel safe and return to some sort of normalcy.

""This order, while well-intentioned, goes too far,"" Anjali said. ""It silences working residents that can only gather after 6 p.m.""

Some say that it is not free speech, but Mayor Thompson said that's not her intention.

""Let me be clear, I will always support the First Amendment and right of people to peacefully protest, but as Mayor I must also balance the right with the safety and well-being of Broadview residents and the businesses.""

At the meeting, Thompson also addressed the video showing Secretary Kristi Noem attempting to use the village hall bathroom on Friday before she was turned away.

""Let me be clear. I've never known an individual to bring a videographer and a photographer to a bathroom break,"" she said.

Thompson said there must be an urgent public health matter inside the Broadview facility. She now wants authorities to check on the people and plumbing inside.

""I am calling on all federal elected congressional officials, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, to inspect the facility immediately.""

As for the nine-hour time limit for protestors, Thompson said the village needs this as they do not have the resources to pay first responders' overtime.

She's not sure if protestors will abide by the order, but she says police will follow protocols.

""It's not in their community. When they leave Broadview, guess where they get to go back, to a safe, calm environment,"" Thompson said.

There will be a hearing in federal court on Tuesday morning, where the village is fighting to get the fence down around the ICE facility that was put up a couple of weeks ago to keep protestors back.

The detainee, Willian Alberto Giménez González, has been active at St. Paul and the Redeemer Episcopal Church on Chicago’s South Side since Fall 2023. The church is hosting a prayer vigil Oct. 7 for González – and for all “our immigrant neighbors” – as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conduct raids and detain residents across the Chicago area.

“We believe that Willian’s detention is unjust, and that his immediate release would benefit not just Willian and his family but also our community and our country,” St. Paul and the Redeemer said in a written statement, which noted that González is an asylum-seeker who had recently received a work permit. “Yet ICE arrested him anyway and quickly moved him across state lines.”

González was taken into custody Sept. 12 during an ICE traffic stop. His attorney told an American Prospect reporter that González, at the time of the incident, was taking his wife to get a haircut in a largely Latino neighborhood southwest of downtown Chicago. After being held briefly at an ICE facility in suburban Chicago, he was taken to a different ICE facility in Baldwin, Michigan, north of Grand Rapids.

“ICE is circumventing laws and processes to create terror in communities of people seeking a better life, and we are joining with Christians and others who feel spiritually compelled to call for justice and mercy,” St. Paul and the Redeemer said in its statement.

ICE has taken an increasingly aggressive approach toward immigration enforcement in Chicago, the United States’ third largest city, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up arrests and deportations and fulfill a campaign promise of sharply reducing both legal and illegal immigration.

Early last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching a major immigrant enforcement action in Chicago that it dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” Since then, local officials, Democratic state legislators, immigrant advocates and residents have accused the Trump administration of heavy-handed tactics that have sometimes involved detentions of people with no criminal records or immigration violations.

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested in Chicago in the past month, including 37 on Sept. 30 in an early-morning ICE raid that targeted one apartment building on Chicago’s South Side. Residents reported fearing they were under siege by a military-style operation. Agents reportedly landed on the building from helicopters, then went door to door making arrests.

President Donald Trump has vowed to further escalate the crackdown by sending troops, including the Texas National Guard, into Chicago and other Democrat-led cities, saying reinforcements are needed to protect federal property and employees. After federal agents shot and injured a woman in Chicago on Oct. 4, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Chicago a “war zone.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of manufacturing a crisis and then making it worse. The ICE agents in Chicago were indiscriminately “picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Pritzker said in an Oct. 5 interview with CNN. “They are the ones that are making it a war zone.”

The Diocese of Chicago has been active in helping immigrant communities and their supporters across northern Illinois respond to the presence of ICE and threats of arrest. A statement released Sept. 10 by a group of diocesan ministry leaders affirmed that Episcopalians in Chicago were “standing in solidarity with immigrants and asylum-seekers.”

“We urge all diocesan churches, clergy, and laity to get involved as we redouble our efforts to welcome the stranger, protect the vulnerable and respect the dignity of every human being,” they said. They referenced an earlier pastoral letter from Chicago Bishop Paula Clark calling on Episcopalians to support “our immigrant siblings.”

“Anxiety and apprehension are rampant in our communities, especially those of people of color, who are affected by these threats. People are afraid to go to church, the grocery store, or even to work,” Clark said in her Aug. 1 letter. “This is not merely about immigration – it is about justice, dignity, and the soul of our diocese.”

The diocese has invited all members to join the prayer vigil at St. Paul and the Redeemer, which starts at 7 p.m. Oct. 7, in support of immigrants like González, the parishioner being held by ICE in Michigan.

González “is a faithful participant in our worship and gives financially to the church every week. He has helped cultivate the earth in our food garden and shared dinners in our homes. We pray and sing together,” the congregation said in its written statement protesting his detention. “Every Sunday we receive the sacrament of Holy Communion together recognizing that we are God’s beloved children created in God’s image, and all have a place at God’s Table.”

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network has raised $5,800 to support González through a GoFundMe campaign. The Diocese of Chicago also worked with the Diocese of the Great Lakes in Michigan to arrange for González to receive a pastoral visit with a priest at the facility.

His next immigration court date is Oct. 8.

“I find myself surprised by all you have done to support me,” González said in a written statement released by the diocese. “It fills me up with hope and I ask God to help me get out of this place. I’m grateful to the church, from the bottom of my heart.”",https://i0.wp.com/episcopalnewsservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ENS_100625_Chicago.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:42.388181

So far, Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until government funding is restored.
“We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things,” Trump told reporters.
Several recent polls have shown Democrats with a narrow edge in the public’s opinion of a shutdown.
Johnson reiterated that he would not call the chamber back into session until government funding is restored.","The US government shutdown entered its second week as the Senate again rejected rival bills to restart funding and Donald Trump suggested he might be open to negotiating with Democrats over the healthcare subsidies they have put at the heart of the stalemate.

A fifth Senate vote to advance a Republican-written bill that would reopen the government failed on a 52-42 tally – well below the 60-vote threshold needed for advancement. The Democrats’ proposal was defeated in a 50-45 party-line vote. No lawmakers changed their votes from recent days, though there were a handful of absences.

Many agencies and departments closed their doors and told employees to stay home last Wednesday, after Congress failed to approve legislation to continue the government’s authority to spend money. The Trump administration warned it was prepared to move forward with plans to slash the federal workforce.

“After five failed votes, Republicans should understand that they cannot go forward unless we come to a bipartisan agreement to address the healthcare crisis,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement after the afternoon votes.

Democrats have refused to back any bill that does not include an array of healthcare-centered concessions, among them, an extension of premium tax credits for people covered by Affordable Care Act health insurance. So far, Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until government funding is restored.

But Trump, speaking from the Oval Office on Monday, said he might be willing to strike a deal with Democrats on the ACA subsidies, though he also echoed the conservative claim that “billions and billions” of dollars are being wasted.

“We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things,” Trump told reporters. “And I’m talking about good things with regard to health care.”

Schumer denied any outreach from the president, and the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, said the White House has been “radio silent” since a meeting with the president last week.

“Trump’s claim isn’t true – but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table,” Schumer said in a statement. “For months, Democrats have been calling on Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to come to the table and work with us to deliver lower costs and better healthcare for the American people.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that if the shutdown stretched on, a program thats pays for food for low-income mothers and children would exhaust its funding, while government employees would miss a paycheck, though federal law entitles them to back pay. She also reiterated the Trump administration’s threats to fire federal workers.

“We don’t want to see people laid off. But, unfortunately, if this shutdown continues, layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,” Leavitt said.

In the days since the shut down began, Russ Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, has cancelled funding for energy projects in several states, as well as transportations developments in Chicago and New York – all of which are areas governed by Democrats.

But though he warned before funding lapsed that he would use it as an opportunity to deepen cuts to the federal workforce, those have largely not yet taken place.

Asked about when layoffs may be announced, Leavitt replied: “We’ll see how the vote goes tonight.”

Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress have shown no signs of budging from their demands in the days since the shutdown began. Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House on recess for a second straight week, in a bid to pressure Senate Democrats to provide the roughly eight votes the Republican funding bill is expected to need to advance in the upper chamber.

“The ball is in the court of the Senate Democrats. There’s only a handful of people in the country who can solve this problem,” Johnson told a press conference.

The Democratic minority has largely stuck to their demands that any legislation to fund the government includes an extension of the ACA tax credits. Created under Joe Biden, the credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and costs for 20 million enrollees of the plans will rise if they are not extended.

The party has also included in their funding bill a reversal of the Republican cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to the poor and disabled, as well as a restoration of funding for public media outlets like PBS and NPR, and a prohibition on Donald Trump’s use of a “pocket rescission” to undo congressional appropriations.

Senate’s Republican majority leader John Thune has vowed to continue holding votes on the parties’ bills. No Republicans have supported the Democratic proposal, while only three members of the minority – John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine – have backed the GOP bill.

Several recent polls have shown Democrats with a narrow edge in the public’s opinion of a shutdown. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll found that 53% of respondents held the GOP responsible for the shutdown, as opposed to 47% who blamed the Democrats. Seventy percent of those surveyed opposed the shutdown overall.

Johnson reiterated that he would not call the chamber back into session until government funding is restored. He has also said he will only swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva once the House returns to work.

Grijalva is set to be the 218th lawmaker to sign a petition that will force a vote on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson and Trump oppose releasing the files, and Thomas Massie, an iconoclastic Republican representative who has led the charge to make the documents public, accused Johnson of keeping the House out of session to delay that vote.

“Why are we in recess? Because the day we go back into session, I have 218 votes for the discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files,” Massie said, adding that Johnson “doesn’t want that to be the news”.

""This is something that popped up mid-to-late last week,"" DeCosmo said. ""So those letters could be arriving this week or next.""

They say their concern comes as word that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is allegedly sending letters to teenagers about returning to their home countries.

The staff at Camden Center for Law and Social Justice writes that the ICE notifications, which they say the community has labeled ""Freaky Friday Letters,"" might contain financial offers or strong and threatening language.

""They started being given to youth already in immigration detention starting last Tuesday or Wednesday. They may actually be mailed out now,"" DeCristofaro said.

CBS News Philadelphia also obtained a letter from the Camden School District. Officials there are trying to clear up confusion, recommending families still send their children to school, and in the event they receive a letter from ICE, consult a trusted adult, an advocate or a lawyer.

""Now they're going to be getting letters saying we want you to give up these protections and return home, and those will be frightening for these kids,"" DeCristofaro said.

Attorneys say they haven't seen one of the letters yet. CBS News Philadelphia reached out to a spokesperson for ICE. They responded in part, ""These allegations are categorically false. The anti-ICE activists have made up a ridiculous term, 'Freaky Friday,' to instill fear and spread misinformation.""

The agency went on to explain it is, in fact, offering a voluntary option for unaccompanied children, it says, who were smuggled into the country to return home to their families. CBS News Philadelphia has learned the offer will be made first to 17-year-olds.

ICE says this will allow them to make an informed decision about their future. ICE added any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin.

But staff at the Camden public interest law firm responded that in the statement from ICE, the agency doesn't dispute they're reaching out to those under 18 with an offer.

Members of the law firm explained that this appears to mark a policy change.

Durbin lamented National Guard members being “used as political pawns for the political theater of President Trump,” adding to CNN he believes their deployment isn’t necessary for law and order in his home state of Illinois.

The senator also pointed to the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the use of the US military for domestic law enforcement without explicit congressional authorization.

“These men and women in the guard are not trained in law enforcement, because the law does not allow them,” he told John Berman on “CNN News Central.” “Is not fair to them. It’s certainly not fair to the legitimate law enforcement in our state.”

>> What is the Insurrection Act?

The role of local law enforcement is to protect peaceful protesters and their First Amendment rights by “standing between” them and federal officers, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested, “so that ICE and CBP are not firing at them and that we’re doing our best to protect them.”

Federal agents “are creating an environment in which they’re inciting people to do something more than just peacefully protest,” the Democratic governor said Monday during a news conference in his state’s most populous city.

At the request of police in suburban Broadview – where an ICE facility has drawn protests for weeks – and with the help of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the state “sent backup” to protect protesters and residents “who have had ICE and CBP operating in their neighborhoods in an aggressive fashion and interfering with their daily lives,” Pritzker said.

Forty local governments and many of their leaders are asking a federal appeals court to keep National Guard troops out of Portland as the panel decides whether to block a lower court’s order.

On Saturday, District County Judge Karin Immergut blocked the Trump administration from federalizing the Oregon National Guard and sending troops to a Portland immigration facility that has been the site of protests for months.

When the administration responded by trying to move active-duty California National Guard troops to Portland, Immergut expanded her order to prohibit any National Guard deployment in Oregon for two weeks.

Included in the list of officials who signed the amicus brief is Steve Mulroy, the District Attorney of Shelby County, Tennessee. His district includes Memphis, where the Trump administration launched a crime task force of federal law enforcement agents alongside members of the Tennessee National Guard deployed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee.

As of Saturday, 227 arrests had been made by that task force, according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Local prosecutors will struggle to handle the surge in cases, Mulroy said, telling CNN affiliate WMC that the county needs an immediate funding increase to pay for more court hearings.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday blasted the Trump administration for orchestrating a “military-style raid” in Chicago last week, making the argument that the Trump administration uses military assets as “political props.”

The governor pointed to an ICE raid in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, where Black Hawk helicopters and swarms of federal agents in full tactical gear descended on an apartment building.

“In the dead of night and seemingly for the cameras, armed federal agents emerged from the Black Hawk helicopters rappelling onto the roof of that apartment building,” Pritzker said during a news conference, claiming the operation was filmed with high-definition cameras and later posted on social media by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The governor tied the raid to what he described as a broader strategy by the Trump administration to “cause chaos, create fear and confusion, make it seem like peaceful protesters are a mob by firing gas pellets and tear gas canisters at them.”

Pritzker delivered the comments hours after his state and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit to block the deployment of federalized National Guard troops. The governor alleged during the news conference that the Trump administration’s strategy is meant to “create the pretext” for sending troops to the city.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement disputing Pritzker’s claims, accusing him of spreading “hateful rhetoric” and failing to protect law enforcement in Chicago.

“President Trump has the authority under the Constitution to deploy troops, wherever they’re stationed, to defend federal facilities from attacks,” the DHS said.

In a hearing Monday, US District Judge April Perry in Illinois gave the Trump administration until the end of the day Wednesday to file arguments on why she should not block President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago.

Perry was nominated to the federal bench in the Northern District of Illinois last year by President Joe Biden.

A year earlier, Biden had nominated her to serve as the US Attorney for the same district, but that nomination was among those held up by then-Ohio Senator JD Vance, who was blocking Justice Department nominees to protest a federal indictment against Trump brought by former Special Counsel Jack Smith, according to Reuters.

Perry previously served as an assistant US attorney in Illinois’ Northern District for 12 years. Before her 2024 nomination, she worked as the senior counsel of global investigations and fraud and abuse prevention at GE HealthCare in Chicago.

Perry earned her law degree in 2003 from Northwestern University, where she also earned her bachelor’s degree.

President Donald Trump suggested yesterday he could invoke the Insurrection Act if courts continue to block deployments of troops to cities nationwide, raising the prospect of using the centuries-old law to bypass unfavorable rulings.

“So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”

Officials in Illinois and Oregon are waging legal battles against Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland.

Illinois and Chicago sued the administration yesterday, asking a federal court to halt the federalization of National Guard troops from that state and from Texas, calling the move “patently unlawful.”

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to Portland for the second time, but the Trump administration has asked an appeals court to pause the judge’s order.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2239242013.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-07 08:57:35.903167

Mirella told the ICE watchers Jesus had the gas money she needed to drive home.
Tamburello said the ICE watchers provide ""an important service.""","At 5:30 a.m., the sky was pitch black in downtown Framingham. Five unmarked vehicles — some black, others gray — roamed around with tinted windows and Texas plates.

A group of people who monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were out watching for activity.

One of the observers followed a car she suspected contained federal agents. She recorded a video that showed an officer turning his attention to her, telling her it's dangerous to follow agents at work.

“I'm free to drive around and record in the country,” the woman protested.

“And we are free to find out who you are,” the agent said. “May I see your passport?”

The woman — a U.S. citizen originally from Brazil who we’re identifying by her first initial, A. — presented her passport. The agent ran her name, then told her she could leave.

Immigration advocates say ICE arrests have been surging in Massachusetts since early September, when the Department of Homeland Security announced a renewed enforcement effort in the state. Reports have flooded social media of people arrested at courthouses, during traffic stops and on their way to work.

Connected through a community group called LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, activists — like the ones gathered early in the morning in Framingham — are documenting arrests throughout the state. LUCE volunteers operate a hotline and monitor social media for reports of ICE activity, then dispatch local observers to the scene. Once they get information, they report back to the larger group, and keep notes of everything they see.

According to LUCE, there are hundreds of “ICE watchers” at work, recording the names of those arrested to make sure they’re accounted for. Volunteers canvass neighborhoods in the wake of ICE activity. They say federal agents often arrest family breadwinners, leaving spouses and children in need of help, and LUCE tries to connect them with resources.

LUCE says it’s been getting about 100 calls a day since early September. The wee hours of the morning are often the most active, and MetroWest is one of several hotspots in eastern Massachusetts.

WBUR agreed to use only the first name or initial of the people interviewed for this story — they’re concerned that they or family members could be targeted based on their immigration status.

M. is a British-born U.S. citizen who has lived here for 25 years. And he said he was never an activist until now.

“ICE can just show up and start asking people for their papers,” M. said. “That's not the country that this is supposed to be. That's Eastern Europe in the ‘80s. I don't want us to go to that.”

The agency didn’t respond to questions for this story; ICE has said previously that agents are in Massachusetts arresting “rapists, child abusers, drug traffickers, and other violent thugs.”

But the agency provides almost no details on the people agents arrest. During the last enforcement surge in Massachusetts in May, ICE announced about half of the 1,500 detainees had “significant criminal convictions or charges,” either in the U.S. or abroad. Federal data show that ICE classified the vast majority of men in detention in Massachusetts as not a ""threat.""

M. said it’s understandable that the government wants to hold immigrants accountable to the country’s laws. But he said communities are being uprooted and it’s hard to make sense of why.

“The government has turned a blind eye to people living here 20, 30, 40 years — and then suddenly [is] just rounding them up,” he said. “They're clearly contributing to the community in really big ways.”

He said two days earlier, nine landscapers were arrested in the town of Hopedale, outside of Framingham.

The ICE watchers were on edge this Friday morning in late September — two days before, there was a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas — and the observers know the ICE officers were probably on edge, too.

The top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts, U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, has warned that impeding an arrest or assaulting an agent can be a criminal offense.

M. said the group’s role is to bear witness, not interfere.

Driving around Framingham, he listened to voice messages in a group chat about the latest ICE sighting.

He explained the agents seem to travel in groups of five or six vehicles. One agent who wears a cowboy hat is referred to as “El Vaquero de Marlborough,” the cowboy of Marlborough; the ICE watchers call another agent “Sooner,” an agent who apparently told observers she comes from Oklahoma.

Most of the vehicles spotted by the ICE watchers over the past month have been unmarked Dodge Chargers and Durangos or Ford Explorers. Many have out-of-state plates, mostly from Texas, but also Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire.

Rumors of ICE sightings are rampant. One report claimed there were agents inside Waltham district court, but they turned out to be local cops. Someone else said a large number of federal agents were gathering at a hotel, but ICE watchers found it was some kind of police conference.

Then, M. got a call that sounded legit.

“ICE is at the Milford courthouse,” the caller said, adding two other details: blue Nissan Rogue and the officer was in plain clothes.

M. headed for Milford — a half hour south of Framingham — a town the ICE watchers say has been swarmed by immigration police in recent weeks. In front of the Milford courthouse, several ICE watchers said a female agent had just rushed out and crossed the street.

Three unmarked vehicles surrounded a small Ford. The ICE watchers ran over with their phones out, recording. Agents were pulling a man out of the car and handcuffing him. He shouted his name out.

The agents moved fast, pushing the man into their vehicle before speeding off.

A woman left in the driver’s seat of the Ford Focus looked shocked. She said her name is Mirella and she’d driven her friend Jesus up from Baltimore for a court date.

“ That was my first time ever experiencing that and seeing that,” Mirella said. “That is insane.”

Jesus' lawyer asked WBUR to use just his first name because she fears he could face retaliation by ICE. Court records show Jesus was facing charges for domestic violence and witness intimidation; the case was dismissed right before ICE grabbed him.

Mirella said she was waiting in the car when Jesus walked out of court. She said the agents seemed to be after someone else.

“They asked him if he was a completely different person,” she said. And “they just took him instead.”

ICE didn’t respond to questions about the arrest.

Mirella told the ICE watchers Jesus had the gas money she needed to drive home. One of them took up a collection, then handed Mirella a stack of 20s. It was enough for tolls and gas, plus a couple meals on the way to Baltimore.

But there was more work to be done. That afternoon, the ICE watchers got ahold of Jesus’ mother and sent her video of his arrest. That’s how his lawyer, Baltimore-based Hayley Tamburello, found out he was in custody.

Tamburello said he was flown to an ICE facility in Buffalo, and then to another in Natchez, Mississippi.

On Monday morning, 10 days after the arrest, Tamburello said neither her, nor Jesus' mother, has received a call from him. She doesn't know if that's because he can't make a phone call, or because he doesn't have their numbers memorized.

Tamburello said the ICE watchers provide ""an important service."" If it hadn’t been for them, she said, she doesn’t know how they would have found out what happened to Jesus.

""I wouldn't have known,"" Tamburello said. ""I can tell you that.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0926_ice-fram-3-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:54.084693

“On Saturday, he was released,” said Constanza Segovia of Victor Sanchez Sr., who was arrested last month at a routine immigration check-in.

Segovia said Sanchez was ordered to leave the country within 30 days, but “we're going to keep fighting.”

She read a statement provided by Sanchez in both Spanish and English.

“I am so happy to be back with family and the community,” Segovia read. “I went to Mass yesterday, and when they saw me, they hugged me, and the priest said, ‘Oh my God, I can't believe you're here.’ I want to share this, because miracles can happen through unity and our community coming together.”

Sanchez’s was one of several recent arrests, as ICE activity in Connecticut has increased since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term in January.

Faith leaders speak out

Monday’s demonstration began with a vigil outside the Abraham A. Ribicoff Federal Building in downtown Hartford, which houses a federal courthouse, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, and other federal offices. Participants then marched to the state Capitol, chanting “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.”

The Rev. Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester said the crowd gathered in opposition to federal immigration policy and actions. Pawelek is a member of the steering committee for the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance, which organized the rally along with Connecticut For All.

“Immigrant communities are under attack,” Pawelek said. “The current federal administration is reveling in cruel, violent, racist assaults on the dignity and humanity of immigrants in this country.”

ICE has consistently claimed to be targeting “the worst of the worst.” NPR reported in July that tens of thousands of those arrested by ICE lack a criminal record.

“They are intentionally creating suffering, terror, trauma and chaos in some of our most vulnerable communities,” Pawelek said. “It is racist, it is un-American, it is unacceptable.”

The Rev. Jocelyn Gardner Spencer said her faith impelled her to speak out against what she sees as federal policies that fly in the face of her religious teachings.

“Every person facing the racist, cruel, violent actions of ICE enforcement that my tax dollars and yours are paying for is somebody's baby, as deserving of protection and love and care as mine,” she said. “And every time somebody's baby is harmed, it breaks not only human hearts, it breaks God's heart, too.”

“We will pray and we will march and we will speak truth to power, and we will show up as many times as it takes until our leaders do what is right and not what is easy, what is faithful and not what is expedient,” Spencer said.

Four demands for state lawmakers

Pawelek and others called on Gov. Ned Lamont to call a special session to strengthen protections under state law for undocumented residents. Pawelek listed four main demands.

“One is: safeguard the personal data of Connecticut residents, such as those with drive-only licenses or HUSKY health care or in-state tuition,” Pawelek said. “Two, protect access to our justice system by prohibiting ICE enforcement actions in state courthouses.”

“Three, close loopholes that allow state and local resources to indirectly support federal immigration enforcement, and finally, maintain funding for HUSKY so that no one loses coverage.”

Asked for a response to the demonstrators’ demands, Lamont spokesperson Kevin Rivera did not directly indicate whether or not the governor was considering such a special session.

“Governor Lamont’s focus continues to be on making sure all Connecticut residents feel safe in our schools, places of worship, and elsewhere,” Rivera said. “Just a few weeks ago, the Governor along with Supreme Court Chief Justice Mullins announced additional protections in our courthouses to prevent warrantless arrests and banning the use of masks.”

“Governor Lamont will continue to work towards keeping our communities safe, including members of our immigrant community who are focused on creating a better life for themselves and their families,” Rivera’s statement concluded.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8989794/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7772x4080+0+1101/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fba%2Fd1%2F13b17bd8449b84fcdd09961fe29a%2F251006immigrantrightsrally-mmd1625.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:31.552551

The county enters the final year of its contracts with ICE and the GEO Group as the Trump administration has intensified efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.

Moshannon — which had already been accused of physical and psychological abuse, inadequate health care, and poor conditions — has also come under increased scrutiny over the past several months after the hanging death of Chaofeng Ge, a Chinese citizen who was detained at the facility near Philipsburg.

Abigail Grimes-Haldiman, who is part of Indivisible Mayday, told Spotlight PA that no amount of money justifies the facility staying open. Indivisible Mayday is a grassroots organization that protests what it deems to be right-wing agendas.

“We don’t have to evoke human suffering in order to make money for the county,” Grimes-Haldiman said.

In September 2021, the Clearfield County commissioners voted to enter into a five-year intergovernmental service agreement with ICE “to provide detention services for detainees,” according to the agreement.

The commissioners also approved a services contract with GEO Group, an international company based in Florida that owns and operates correctional and detention facilities around the globe. It “requires GEO to perform all duties and accept all responsibilities incumbent upon” the county under its agreement with ICE, according to the contract.

The ACLU sued the commissioners after they signed the contracts with ICE and GEO Group, alleging commissioners violated the state’s open meetings law.

Also under the contract, GEO Group agrees to pay the county an administrative fee of $200,000 per year “in recognition of [county] costs in time and resources.”

That $200,000 yearly payment accounts for less than 0.5% of Clearfield County’s annual budget. The county projected revenues of $41.7 million in 2025.

The administrative fee goes into the county’s general fund and isn’t earmarked for any specific purpose, Clearfield County Commissioner Dave Glass told Spotlight PA.

USA Today reported that GEO Group billed the federal government $4.5 million in December, which was about on par for most of the other months in 2024. But in 2025, those monthly payments have been on an upward trajectory, reaching $5.3 million in May.

That money essentially passes from ICE to Clearfield County to GEO Group.

The contract “helps GEO to circumvent onerous federal contracting requirements that exist when a private company directly contracts with the federal government,” according to an August 2024 report from Temple University’s Sheller Center for Social Justice.

The detention center contracts run through the end of next September, and Clearfield County commissioners will decide next year whether they will be renewed.

“All things being equal, I anticipate my advocating a renewal of the contract as I do not believe that the resident detainees’ civil rights are being violated at GEO and I do believe that they are receiving all other protections afforded to them by American law on the part of the institution,” Commissioner John Sobel told Spotlight PA.

Commissioner Tim Winters told Spotlight PA that he didn’t see a reason not to renew the contract.

While Glass said he’s generally happy with GEO Group, he has concerns about the way ICE agents have been conducting themselves and said they would give him pause before voting to renew contracts for the Moshannon facility.

Glass told Spotlight PA he understands deporting known criminals or individuals with criminal connections who have had due process.

“But rounding people up who have been upstanding members of American communities for years — in some cases decades — makes no sense to me and seems like a serious overreaction,” Glass said.

According to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, as of mid-September the most recent average daily population numbers for Moshannon are 1,404 — up from 1,171 when Trump was inaugurated.

(TRAC is a nonprofit that tracks federal agency data, including on immigration.)

The facility has a capacity of 1,876, according to GEO Group’s website.

It was previously owned and operated by GEO Group as a federal prison until March 2021, when former President Joe Biden signed an executive order banning private prison contracts.

The prison employed 300 people before it closed, WPSU reported.

Eight months later, the facility reopened as an ICE immigration detention center.

Sobel said in 2021 that the move would offer “well-paying, family sustaining jobs” to many of the former prison employees, according to the newsroom.

He told Spotlight PA that Moshannon Valley Processing Center “has a great economic impact.”

According to Winters, the facility employs 407 full-time GEO Group employees and about two dozen full-time ICE employees. He said it also pays property taxes that go to the Philipsburg-Osceola Area School District and fund “essential services” in Decatur Township.",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNS8xMC8wMW1lLTg0YzctYm1nai14ZnFkLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 04:56:40.342413

Trump suspended the refugee program in January

The refugee program — which once had widespread bipartisan support — was suspended on Trump's first day in office.

Since then, only a trickle of refugees have been admitted to the country, either as part of an ongoing court case seeking to resume the program or as part of a new refugee program for Afrikaners that Trump announced in February. The administration says the white South African farmers face discrimination and violence at home, which the country's government strongly denies.

Some 128,000 refugees have currently been approved for resettlement in the United States and are now stuck in limbo, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency. In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.

""How can a president who claims to stand for religious and American values and who claims to support legal and orderly migration turn his back on so many refugees who followed the rules, while moving white South Africans to the front of the line?"" he said.

The expected admissions are lower than advocates hoped

The 7,500 number is a dramatic reduction in the already historically low refugee admission caps that Trump put forward during his first term and also well below what refugee advocates had feared would be the target for the coming fiscal year.

In early- to mid-September, organizations that assist refugees began sounding the alarm that the administration was considering a cap of roughly 30,000, with most of those spots reserved for white South Africans.

Administration officials said at the time that the numbers were in flux and would require White House sign off, but gave no indication that the total number could be slashed by more than 20,000 from what the advocates had feared.

As the government shutdown loomed last week, these officials began to say that no final determination would be made until Congress had been consulted and that that was unlikely until after the shutdown ended.

One senior U.S. official said Saturday such consultation is still required and would not likely occur until the government goes back to work.

But the official also noted that 7,500 admissions in the current fiscal year would be ""significantly more"" than had been allowed in since Trump took office for the second time in January.

Other refugees may be left in limbo

Certain lawmakers in Congress have been pressing the White House for the official notification, which was required by law by the Sept. 30 deadline.

The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees that handle immigration matters said the Trump administration is ""in open defiance of the law.""

Refugees are being left in ""limbo,"" wrote Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and other top Democrats on the Judiciary panels in a letter last week. ""The consequences are dire.""

They said thousands of people facing persecution abroad, ""who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements,"" are being left to languish in refugee camps while Trump is ""carving out exceptions for white South African farmers, allowing Afrikaners to skip the line.""

CHICAGO — During the summer of 2025, the Trump Administration has deployed federal forces to cities across the United States with announced missions to deter crime and enforce immigration laws. These federal forces, however, have used violent force against the press, elected officials, religious leaders, and private individuals engaged in peaceful and protected activities.

These federal forces are not trained to conduct local policing, and their tactics involve the indiscriminate use of force and arresting people without any legal basis.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center in Broadview, IL, has been the site of peaceful, constitutionally protected activity for decades, Over the summer of 2025, as a result of reports of inhumane conditions for detainees inside the facility, protesters have gathered to demand the closure of the facility. These protests have been peaceful and non-threatening.

In recent weeks, however, the Trump Administration has sent federal officials and agents to brutally suppress free speech at the site through intentional and escalating violence, including the dangerous and indiscriminate use of near-lethal weapons such as tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper-balls, flash grenades, and other unwarranted and disproportionate tactics.

A new lawsuit filed this morning argues that this wanton violence by the federal government is a blatant attempt to interfere with the most cherished and fundamental rights enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief, and the right to peaceably assemble and express disagreement with the government.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint states.

Today’s lawsuit is being brought by members of the press, as well as by individuals representing clergy and ordinary citizens who have chosen to speak in opposition to the Trump Administration’s policies, and who now come together to courageously stand up for the First Amendment rights of all Americans. These include:

Media organizations and outlets such as Block Club Chicago, Chicago Headline Club, the Chicago Newspaper Guild Local 34071, the National Association of Broadcast Employees & Technicians Local 54041, and individual journalists whose attempts to report the truth have been met with targeted attacks and widespread government violence.

Stephanie Lulay, Executive Editor and Co-Founder of Block Club Chicago, says her outlet has allocated a significant portion of its resources to covering DHS actions at the protests since September 19.

“During that time, at least four of our employees or freelancers have told me that they were hit with pepper balls and subjected to tear gas by federal agents at Broadview,” Ms. Lulay reports. “We intend to continue to report on the protests, but our ability to do so, to the standards that we hold ourselves to, continues to be impacted by our fears of violence and arrests of our employees and contractors.”

Members of the clergy, such as Pastor David Black of the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago in the Woodlawn neighborhood, whose peaceful, free expression of his religion has led to his being shot repeatedly in the head with near-lethal projectiles and sprayed in the face with tear gas.

“I extended my arms, palms outstretched toward the ICE officers, in a traditional Christian posture of prayer and blessing,” Pastor Black recalls. “Without any warning, and without any order or request that I and others disperse, I was suddenly fired upon by ICE officers. In rapid fire, I was hit seven times on my arms, face and torso with exploding pellets that contained some kind of chemical agent. It was clear to me that the officers were aiming for my head, which they struck twice.”

Individual protesters, such as William Paulson, a 67-year-old retired union painter, who says he went to the protests because he “wanted to appeal to the humanity of the federal agents at the facility and express that what they were doing was wrong on a moral basis.”

On Sept. 27, Mr. Paulson was there when ICE agents launched an indiscriminate attack on the protesters without audible warning. “Gas canisters had been shot in front of and behind me,” he recalls. “I started to inhale the gas, and I couldn’t see or breathe. Around me, I could hear people being tackled to the ground. Then, flash bang grenades started to go off near me. I was disoriented…My eyes and nose were burning…I fell to all fours and threw up. My eyes and nose were in extreme pain. My skin was burning. I have emphysema and COPD, so the gas affected me very strongly.” Mr. Paulson says he tried to go back the next day but could only stay a few minutes before having to leave. “I felt afraid the entire time I was there,” he says.

The complaint names as defendants Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Kristi Noem; Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons; Acting Executive Associate Director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles; ICE’s Chicago Field Office Director Russell Hott; Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Gregory Bovino; Attorney General of the United States Pam Bondi; individual agents of ICE, CBP, DHS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Justice who have largely concealed their identities and culpability behind masks; and Donald Trump, President of the United States.

The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Loevy + Loevy, the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, the Mandel Legal Aid Clinic of the University of Chicago School of Law, First Defense Legal Aid, Protect Democracy, and the ACLU of Illinois.

The attorneys are also filing an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, asking the court for immediate, injunctive relief against the government’s violent suppression of free speech.

A similar motion was filed and granted in Los Angeles last month, after federal troops deployed the same sorts of tactics against journalists and protesters.

Kayla Epstein

President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard into several US cities has drawn a round of legal challenges by state and local officials.

Trump argues the use of federal troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.

But several Democratic governors have pushed back, saying the deployments are unnecessary and risk escalating tensions.

Illinois filed a lawsuit on Monday asking a judge to block the deployment of troops to Chicago, while a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members from Texas and California to Portland, Oregon.

As the legal battles continue, here's what to know about the National Guard:

What is the National Guard and who oversees it?

The National Guard consists of primarily state-based troops that typically respond to issues like natural disasters or large protests.

All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands have their own contingent of National Guard troops. Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.

Though the National Guard ultimately reports to the Department of Defence, and the president can federalise troops in certain circumstances, requests for its support typically start at a local level.

The governor of a state makes the call to activate National Guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.

National Guard troops have limited power, however. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. And a law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.

How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in cities?

Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now.

In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though California Governor Gavin Newsom objected. California filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration.

One lawsuit challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second lawsuit, a federal judge found that Trump's use of the National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

This summer, hundreds of National Guard troops arrived in Washington, DC because of what he called a ""situation of complete and total lawlessness."" Trump cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.

Trump has now authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, alleged Trump is trying to ""manufacture a crisis"" and has filed a lawsuit.

This week, Trump attempted to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked the action late Sunday night.

What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?

A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. But up until now, presidents rarely used it.

10 US Code § 12406 allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is ""invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,"" or ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion"" against the US government.

Trump invoked this law to federalise 2,000 National Guard troops in June in order to support ICE missions.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.

""We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. ""And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.""

Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?

Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland over the weekend.

Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol agency, clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.

The Portland Police Bureau said it arrested two people on 4 October who engaged ""in aggressive behaviour toward each other in the street"" and refused to follow orders. One person was in possession of bear spray and a collapsable baton.

Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement fired tear gas and smoke canisters to break up the protest and made several arrests.

Trump has claimed the city is ""burning down,"" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said ""there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.""

The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighboring Oregon to respond to the protests.

But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked his action in a pair of back-to-back rulings.

On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. ""This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,"" she wrote in her ruling.

The next day, she issued a temporary restraining order against him deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e454/live/a48a95e0-a2ed-11f0-8009-71dc5acedc16.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:57:04.557483

The artificial nature of France’s immigration divide becomes clear when comparing political rhetoric with policy outcomes and public opinion.
Despite decades of heated debate, French immigration levels remain relatively stable.","Immigration is a highly contentious and contested issue in France. During the past 20 years, 12 laws have been introduced aimed at bringing about an ever more restrictive approach to immigration — and yet every poll keeps showing the French want ever stricter border control. That is despite France no longer being a major destination country. Although 10.7% of its population is foreign-born, the annual immigration rate into France (the ratio between immigrant inflows and the total population of the country) amounted to 0.37% in 2023 and is among the lowest in OECD countries. It is three times as low as countries such as Belgium (1.06%), Canada (1.06%) or Germany (1.37%).

A closer examination of the apparent polarisation around immigration shows it is largely driven by a strategic political positioning to transform the immigration issue from a practical policy matter into a symbolic battleground. As political parties struggle to retain their voters, they use immigration to activate the left-right division, generating rather than reflecting genuine societal cleavage.

The illusion of left-right opposition

At first glance, France’s political spectrum appears neatly divided on immigration, with the left advocating for humanitarian concerns, while the right emphasises control and security. This binary presentation fails to capture the complexity of public opinion and policy realities.

Firstly, immigration ranks relatively low among French citizens’ primary concerns. Surveys repeatedly show that economic issues (particularly purchasing power), healthcare system pressures, and climate change consequences dominate the public’s attention. In IPSOS-CESE polling for issues of public concern, immigration is in sixth position, with only 18% of respondents ranking immigration as their primary concern. It typically appears as a secondary concern, often influenced more by media coverage and political campaigns than by direct personal experience. This suggests that the political emphasis on immigration may be disproportionate to its actual importance in citizens’ daily lives.

Secondly, annual surveys on racism show consistent progress towards greater societal understanding and tolerance. The Longitudinal Tolerance Index, published by the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH), shows a rise in the level of tolerance towards foreigners since 1990, with younger generations more exposed to foreign cultures displaying the highest levels.

Lastly, contrary to the heated political discourse, French public opinion demonstrates significant consensus on key immigration issues. Polling consistently shows that majorities across political affiliations support targeted immigration to address labour shortages in specific sectors, from healthcare to agriculture. According to the think tank Terra Nova, 58% of the population is in favour of labour immigration — selected or not — with the number rising to 70% among those who are acquainted with immigrants. Similarly, there is broad agreement on the need to reduce irregular immigration and improve the efficiency of asylum procedures.

Most citizens support skilled migration programs, family reunification within reasonable limits, and humanitarian protection for refugees. Even on contentious issues like integration requirements, polling reveals more agreement than disagreement, with most French citizens supporting language learning and civic education programs rather than opposing immigration entirely.

The disconnect between the intensity of political rhetoric and the public’s priorities indicates that the immigration debate serves a political agenda beyond addressing genuine public concerns. It provides a convenient arena for political competition and identity formation, allowing parties to differentiate themselves on symbolic grounds while avoiding more complex economic and social policy discussions.

The historical evolution of immigration governance

Understanding France’s current immigration politics requires examining how migration governance has evolved since the early twentieth century. From the 1920s through to the post-war period, immigration was primarily managed by employers and business associations who recruited foreign workers based on economic needs with minimal political interference. This system, while imperfect, maintained immigration as a largely technical and economic matter rather than a political issue.

Following World War II, civil society organisations increasingly assumed roles in immigrant integration and advocacy. Organisations like CIMADE (Comité Inter-Mouvements Auprès Des Évacués) emerged to assist refugees and migrants, creating a parallel support system that complemented official policies. This period saw immigration managed through a combination of economic pragmatism and humanitarian solidarity, with limited political controversy.

However, during the 1980s, there was a marked turning point with the gradual state centralisation of immigration policy and the rise of the far-right National Front (FN). Immigration shifted from being a primarily economic and humanitarian concern to a central political issue. This transformation coincided with economic restructuring, urban challenges, and the search for new political identities in post-industrial France.

The consequences of this shift have been profound. Business unions, once vocal advocates for immigration to meet labour needs, have largely withdrawn from public debate, preferring to manage their workforce needs quietly. The left has become increasingly fragmented, torn between humanitarian principles, economic realities, and electoral concerns about appearing too permissive. Meanwhile, civil society organisations find themselves marginalised in a political environment that prioritises partisan positioning over practical solutions.

The security-focused vacuum

This institutional transformation has created a political vacuum that right-wing and far-right parties have successfully filled by framing immigration exclusively through security and cultural preservation lenses. Without strong voices advocating for economic pragmatism or humanitarian balance, the debate has shifted toward restrictive policies justified by security concerns and identity politics.

The artificial nature of France’s immigration divide becomes clear when comparing political rhetoric with policy outcomes and public opinion. Despite decades of heated debate, French immigration levels remain relatively stable. Net migration in 2021 amounted to 159,000 persons in 2021, against 163,000 in 2006. In practice, policymakers have fully endorsed the European agenda on migration, with stricter visa requirements, enhanced collaborations with sending and transit states to secure deportation, and an integration policy limited to language courses and civic training.

With a legislative reform every two years on average, in addition to the constant parliamentary debates ramped up by daily media coverage of stories involving immigrants, anti-immigration rhetoric has become dominant and is constantly being reiterated.

This political frenzy over immigration has done more to reactivate and drive the left-right divide than address the public’s concerns. The latest example of this is the recent petition launched by Philippe De Villiers, a far-right pundit, demanding the organisation of a referendum on immigration lest “we change population … lifestyle … civilisation”.

The petition has been largely promoted by conservative media outlets such as Cnews, Europe 1 and Valeurs Actuelles. It garnered 1.9 million signatures, but that number is questionable because it was posted on a non-secure website that allowed multiple signatures by the same person (or bot). All signatories had to automatically agree to their contact details being used by some conservative media outlets to allow them to send newsletters and other commercial material. The endeavour was yet another marketing operation meant to mobilise supporters.

The experience of France shows how poorly performing institutions and political strategies have prevented effective governance of a complex social issue. This has left France with a highly divided left-right battleground, leading to social fracturing that transcends reality on immigration — an issue that enjoys an underlying relative consensus.",https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/immig.jpg?quality=70&w=1024,N,,2025-10-07 02:57:01.607799

The groups called the law an important act of leadership during these times of unprecedented threats to immigrant families.

The resolution prioritizes public safety and human dignity by ensuring city resources go towards community needs rather than sowing fear and division. It codifies policies already implemented by the city to ensure city resources, like the Las Cruces Police Department, are not voluntarily utilized for federal immigration enforcement raids and mass deportations unless required by law.

The resolution also provides protections for all residents’ sensitive personal information, affirms the city’s commitment to uphold residents’ constitutional rights, and prioritizes transparency and accountability in city operations.

“All of us want to feel safe in our communities, but Trump’s deliberate attacks that terrorize and vilify our immigrant neighbors completely erode our public safety,” said Johana Bencomo, mayor pro tem and city councilor for District 4 of the City of Las Cruces. “Las Cruces will continue to fight back against the president's attempt to divide our community. Together we can ensure that everyone—from the family who has been here for generations to the one who just arrived—has stable housing, good jobs, and safe, thriving neighborhoods.""

“The Las Cruces Welcoming City resolution is reflective of our values as New Mexicans: inclusivity, respect, and unity. We are grateful for New Mexico's state leadership and the many local officials who are standing up to Trump's mass detention campaign,” said Tatiana Prieto, policy advocate with the ACLU of New Mexico. “We urge all municipalities to push back against harmful policies by enacting similar legislation, acknowledging the urgent need for state-level protections. We must commit to protecting the rights, dignity, and safety of all people in New Mexico.""

The following quote can be attributed to the New Mexico Dream Team: “Las Cruces has been a leader in putting a people-first approach when it comes to housing, healthcare access, services like public transportation and community infrastructure. The introduction of the Welcoming Community Resolution reaffirms that Las Cruces is a city that loves immigrants, mixed-status families, and people of color and will take the proactive steps to support them. We wholeheartedly support the Las Cruces City Council in the passage of this resolution.”

The following quote can be attributed to the Doña Ana County NAACP: ""We support the 'Las Cruces Welcoming City' resolution because it represents a meaningful commitment to inclusion, respect, and dignity for everyone in our community.

“You cannot serve time for a crime in immigration detention.” __ Mustian reported from New York","BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The immigration detainees sent to a notorious Louisiana prison last month are being punished for crimes for which they have already served time, the American Civil Liberties Union said Monday in a lawsuit challenging the government’s decision to hold what it calls the “worst of the worst” there.

The lawsuit accuses President Donald Trump's administration of selecting the former slave plantation known as Angola for its “uniquely horrifying history"" and intentionally subjecting immigrant detainees to inhumane conditions — including foul water and lacking basic necessities — in violation of the Double Jeopardy clause, which protects people from being punished twice for the same crime.

The ACLU also alleges some immigrants detained at the newly opened “Louisiana Lockup” should be released because the government failed to deport them within six months of a removal order. The lawsuit cites a 2001 Supreme Court ruling raised in several recent immigration cases, including that of the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, that says immigration detention should be ""nonpunitive.""

“The anti-immigrant campaign under the guise of ‘Making America Safe Again’ does not remotely outweigh or justify indefinite detention in ‘America’s Bloodiest Prison’ without any of the rights afforded to criminal defendants,” ACLU attorneys argue in a petition reviewed by The Associated Press.

The AP sent requests for comment to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.

The lawsuit comes a month after state and federal authorities gathered at the sprawling Louisiana State Penitentiary to announce that the previously shuttered prison complex had been refurbished to house up to 400 immigrant detainees that officials said would include some of the most violent in ICE custody.

The complex had been nicknamed “the dungeon” because it previously held inmates in solitary cells for more than 23 hours a day.

ICE repurposed the facility amid an ongoing legal battle over an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” and as Trump continues his large-scale attempt to remove millions of people suspected of entering the country illegally. The federal government has been racing to to expand its deportation infrastructure and, with state allies, has announced other new facilities, including what it calls the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana and the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska. ICE is seeking to detain 100,000 people under a $45 billion expansion Trump signed into law in July.

At Angola last month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters the “legendary” maximum security prison, the largest in the nation, had been chosen to house a new ICE facility to encourage people in the U.S. illegally to self-deport. “This facility will hold the most dangerous of criminals,” she said.

Authorities said the immigration detainees would be isolated from Angola's thousands of civil prisoners, many of whom are serving life sentences for violent offenses.

“I know you all in the media will attempt to have a field day with this facility, and you will try to find everything wrong with our operation in an effort to make those who broke the law in some of the most violent ways victims,"" Landry, a Republican, said during a news conference last month.

“If you don’t think that they belong in somewhere like this, you’ve got a problem.""

The ACLU lawsuit says detainees at “Louisiana Lockup” already were “forced to go on hunger strike” to “demand basic necessities such as medical care, toilet paper, hygiene products and clean drinking water.” Detainees have described a long-neglected facility that was not yet prepared to house them, saying they are contending with mold, dust and ”black"" water coming out of showers, court records show.

Federal and state officials have said those claims are part of a “false narrative” created by the media, and that the hunger strike only occurred after inaccurate reporting.

The lawsuit was filed in Baton Rouge federal court on behalf of Oscar Hernandez Amaya, a 34-year-old Honduran man who has been in ICE custody for two years. He was transferred to “Louisiana Lockup” last month from an ICE detention center in Pennsylvania.

Amaya fled Honduras two decades ago after refusing the violent MS-13 gang's admonition “to torture and kill another human being,” the lawsuit alleges. The gang had recruited him at age 12, court documents say.

Amaya came to the United States, where he worked “without incident” until 2016. He was arrested that year and later convicted of attempted aggravated assault and sentenced to more than four years in prison. He was released on good-time credits after about two years and then transferred to ICE custody.

An immigration judge this year awarded Amaya “Convention Against Torture” protection from being returned to Honduras, the lawsuit says, but the U.S. government has failed to deport him to another country.

“The U.S. Supreme Court has been very clear that immigration detention cannot be used for punitive purposes,” Nora Ahmed, the ACLU of Louisiana’s legal director, told AP. “You cannot serve time for a crime in immigration detention.”

Human Rights Watch found in its July 2024 report that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and unlawful imprisonment.
Governments with influence over Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups should press for the urgent release of civilian hostages, an ongoing war crime, Human Rights Watch said.
When powerful states or their allies disregard international humanitarian law without consequence, they erode the credibility of the entire system and weaken protections for civilians in armed conflicts elsewhere, Human Rights Watch said.
All governments should act to prevent further atrocities and to uphold the universality of human rights.","Human Rights Watch – October 6, 2025 – United States President Donald Trump’s “Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict,” announced on September 29, 2025, is no substitute for the urgent action governments need to take to protect civilians and support justice after two years of grave abuses in Israel and Palestine, Human Rights Watch said today.

The 20-part plan does not directly address human rights issues or accountability for serious crimes committed since October 7, 2023.

Governments should be taking immediate measures, including arms embargoes, targeted sanctions, and support for the International Criminal Court (ICC), in accordance with their international legal obligations to prevent and stop violations by the parties regardless of whether the Trump plan goes forward.

“The two years since October 7, 2023, have brought a seemingly endless stream of atrocities against civilians for which there has been no letup or justice,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch. “Governments should not wait for the adoption of Trump’s or any other plan to take action to prevent further harm to those most at risk.”

Atrocity crimes in Israel and Palestine over the past two years have taken a devastating toll on civilians with thousands killed, maimed, starved, forcibly displaced, and unlawfully held hostage or detained; towns and neighborhoods levelled to the ground; and countless communities and lives devastated, Human Rights Watch said.

Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups gunned down several hundred civilians at festivals and in their homes across two dozen communities in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attacks. Scores of civilians were taken hostage, and many are still held, including those starving in tunnels.

Human Rights Watch found in its July 2024 report that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and unlawful imprisonment.

Governments with influence over Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups should press for the urgent release of civilian hostages, an ongoing war crime, Human Rights Watch said.

In Gaza, Israeli forces have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, most of them civilians, including decimating entire families and killing on average the equivalent of an entire classroom of children each day.

Military operations in Gaza have left most of the territory in ruins, flattening entire neighborhoods and towns and severely damaging or destroying most homes, schools, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure.

Israeli authorities have caused a famine, using starvation as a weapon of war, and forcibly displaced virtually the entire population multiple times.

The United Nations, human rights organizations, and the media have repeatedly reported Israeli authorities’ actions in Gaza that seriously violated international law.

Human Rights Watch found numerous violations of the laws of war amounting to war crimes, crimes against humanity, including extermination, and acts of genocide, and the violation of binding orders by the International Court of Justice.

In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed or maimed, thousands detained, many without trial or charge, and tens of thousands displaced, mostly by Israeli forces, but also by settlers.

The scale of destruction in Gaza and the patterns of attacks have demonstrated the Israeli government’s contempt for its fundamental obligations under international law.

The failure to uphold these norms has consequences that extend far beyond Israel and Palestine. When powerful states or their allies disregard international humanitarian law without consequence, they erode the credibility of the entire system and weaken protections for civilians in armed conflicts elsewhere, Human Rights Watch said.

All governments should act to prevent further atrocities and to uphold the universality of human rights. They should take steps to halt ongoing abuses and support credible investigations and meaningful accountability for those responsible, including the following measures:

Press Israeli authorities to immediately and unconditionally lift unlawful sweeping restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza.

Press Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups to immediately and unconditionally release all civilians held hostage.

Suspend military assistance and arms transfers to Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.

Impose targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against Israeli officials and others credibly implicated in ongoing serious violations.

Suspend preferential trade agreements with Israel and ban trade with illegal settlements.

Publicly express support for the ICC and strongly condemn efforts to intimidate its officials and those cooperating with the court or to interfere with its work; commit to support the enforcement of ICC warrants.

“The worsening repression on the ground as decades of ‘peace processes’ played out should have made clear the folly of relying solely on peace plans to address grave abuses,” Shakir said. “Governments urgently need to take concrete action to protect Gaza’s over two million Palestinians and the Israeli hostages.”",https://imemc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HRW-COVER-e1759748622980.png,N,,2025-10-07 02:57:11.079101

The proposed changes better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities. The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass.

The proposed changes come as Providence residents demand greater accountability following several concerning incidents this summer involving the Police Department. In one such incident, PPD officers were found to have provided “operationally significant” assistance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel performing a raid in the city as part of President Trump’s dangerous nationwide crackdown on undocumented Americans.

After deep research and community engagement, councilors proposed these amendments to ensure that Providence remains a city where all residents can live and thrive without fear.

The proposed changes fall into five major categories:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not normally tasked with immigration who have recently been deputized by the Trump administration in order to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and National Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as those directives are accompanied by a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant. The proposed CPRA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CPRA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces allows families, and especially youth, to have more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and more specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all of the restrictions set forth in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow certain types of non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CPRA violations by Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

Read the full draft of the proposed changes here.

The amendments will now be presented to the full council at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting on Thursday, October 16 for the first of two required passages, along with the committee’s recommendation to pass.",https://council.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Council-Default-2.png,N,,2025-10-06 22:57:10.442258

The first major ruling came on Saturday, when US district judge Karin Immergut, in a case brought by the state of Oregon, blocked the Trump administration from mobilizing 200 Oregon national guard troops to Portland, where protesters have gathered in the block surrounding a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building (Ice) in recent weeks.

In a ruling on Sunday evening, Immergut also granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon, and banned the Trump administration from sending any national guard troops to Portland. .

The ruling came hours after Trump’s administration announced plans to send hundreds of national guard members from California and Texas to the state.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, described the ruling as an important win. “The rule of law has prevailed – and California’s national guard will soon be heading home,” Newsom said in a statement on Sunday. “This ruling is more than a legal victory, it’s a victory for American democracy itself. Donald Trump tried to turn our soldiers into instruments of his political will, and while our fight continues, tonight the rule of law said ‘hell no.’”

Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, seemed incredulous that the president moved to call in national guard troops to Oregon from California and Texas, just hours after she had ruled the first time.

“How could bringing in federalized national guard from California not be in direct contravention to the temporary restraining order I issued yesterday?” she questioned the federal government’s attorney, cutting him off.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she said later. “Why is this appropriate?”

Illinois had followed California and Oregon on Monday in filing lawsuits to stop Trump from sending federal troops to its state. The judge in the case, April M Perry, said in an emergency court hearing later that day that she needed time to review the case before ruling on the state’s request for a restraining order.

The deployments

The Pentagon said on Sunday that 200 guard members were sent from California to Oregon.

Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, said 101 California national guard members had arrived in her state on Saturday night by plane and more were on the way. Kotek said there had been no formal communication with the federal government about the deployment, and that she could not verify the location of the guard members.

JB Pritzker had announced on Sunday that Trump had ordered 400 members of the Texas national guard to deploy to Illinois, Oregon and other states, without communicating with the Illinois governor. Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, said he “fully authorized” Trump to deploy up to 400 of his state’s national guard to “ensure safety for federal officials”.

As the president moves ahead with efforts to federalize the Illinois national guard, Chicago could see troops from Texas deployed on Tuesday or Wednesday.

The pushback

Small protests have been going on outside the Ice facility in Portland since Trump’s second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups but for weeks nightly demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people.

Far from being “under siege” by militants, there were at times fewer than 10 protesters on the sidewalk on an afternoon this week week. Portland police made three arrests on Thursday night after fistfights broke out between demonstrators and a pro-Trump influencer from Washington DC. On Saturday, about 400 people gathered outside the Ice facility before federal agents shot teargas canisters into the crowd.

Trump, however, has turned his attention to the city, calling Portland a “war-ravaged” city that is “burning down” and like “living in hell”.

Local officials have pointed out that the protest occupies one city block far from the downtown in a city that covers 145 sq miles (375 sq km). They also say many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when unrest that grew out of the Black Lives Matter protests roiled the city for several months. Trump sent federal law enforcement to the city then, as well.

Chicago, too, saw demonstrations over the weekend as residents pushed back against the president’s immigration crackdown with protests outside the Broadview immigration processing center. Officials report federal agents have acted violently toward protesters and the Broadview mayor has enacted a curfew limiting demonstrations outside the facility to certain hours.

Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest, in addition to calling the former a “war zone” he has suggested apocalyptic force was needed to quell problems in the latter. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore, Maryland; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans, Louisiana; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

But the governors of Illinois and Oregon see the deployments differently.

Pritzker on Sunday shot back at Kristi Noem, Trump’s homeland security secretary, who reiterated the “war zone” rhetoric. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper, the Illinois governor, accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it. “They are the ones who are making it a war zone,” he said.

“They need to get out of Chicago. If they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they are going to do, they need to get the heck out.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a294eb807260c56f7059c747b05b05c92ed5b3ea/410_0_4818_3854/master/4818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45299e20a1e9eeee44271a1d457ea282",N,,2025-10-07 00:57:22.215049

But the rhetoric of his top confidantes has grown more extreme in recent days.
His goal, Trump has said, is to specifically target Democrats.
As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear exactly how many federal workers or what federal agencies would be targeted.
“If you look at Soros, he is at the top of everything,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance last month.","President Trump rocked American politics at the outset of his first campaign when he first labeled his rivals as enemies of the American people. But the rhetoric of his top confidantes has grown more extreme in recent days.

Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff, declared over the weekend that “a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country” is fueling a historic national schism, “shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general.”

“The only remedy,” Miller said, “is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

It was a maxim from an unelected presidential advisor who is already unleashing the federal government in unprecedented ways, overseeing the federalization of police forces and a sweeping deportation campaign challenging basic tenets of civil liberty.

Miller’s rhetoric comes amid a federal crackdown on Portland, Ore., where he says the president has unchecked authority to protect federal lives and property — and as another controversial Trump advisor harnesses an ongoing government shutdown as pretext for the mass firing of federal workers.

Russ Vought, the president’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, plays the grim reaper in an AI video shared by the president, featuring him roving Washington for bureaucrats to cut from the deep state during the shutdown.

His goal, Trump has said, is to specifically target Democrats.

As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear exactly how many federal workers or what federal agencies would be targeted.

“We don’t want to see people laid off, but unfortunately, if this shutdown continues layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt said during a news briefing.

‘A nation of Constitutional law’

Karin Immergut, a federal judge appointed by Trump, said this weekend that the administration’s justification for deploying California National Guard troops in Portland was “simply untethered to the facts.”

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote, chiding the Trump administration for attempting to circumvent a prior order from her against a federal deployment to the city.

“This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition,” she added: “This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The administration is expected to appeal the judge’s decision, Leavitt said, while calling the judge’s ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

“We’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this, and we are very confident we will win on the merits of the law,” Leavitt said.

If the courts were to side with the administration, Leavitt said local leaders — most of whom are Democrats — should not be concerned about the possibility of long-term plans to have their cities occupied by the military.

“Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place?” Leavitt said. “They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night and the president, all he is trying to do, is fix it.”

Moments later, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that though he does not believe it is necessary yet, he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act “if courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up.”

“Sure, I’d do that,” Trump said. “We have to make sure that our cities are safe.”

The Insurrection Act gives the president sweeping emergency power to deploy military forces within the United States if the president deems it is needed to quell civil unrest. The last time this occurred was in 1992, when California Gov. Pete Wilson asked President George H.W. Bush to send federal troops to help stop the Los Angeles riots that occurred after police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King.

Subsequent posts from Miller on social media over the weekend escalated the stakes to existential heights, accusing Democrats of allying themselves with “domestic terrorists” seeking to overturn the will of the people reflected in Trump’s election win last year.

On Monday, in an interview with CNN, Miller suggested that the administration would continue working to sidestep Immergut’s orders.

“The administration will abide by the ruling insofar as it affects the covered parties,” he said, “but there are also many options the president has to deploy federal resources under the U.S. military to Portland.”

Other Republicans have used similar rhetoric since the slaying of Charlie Kirk, a conservative youth activist, in Utah last month.

Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) wrote that posts from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office have reached “the threshold of domestic terrorism,” after the Democratic governor referred to Miller on social media as a fascist. And Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) said Monday that Democrats demanding an extension of healthcare benefits as a condition for reopening the government were equivalent to terrorists.

“I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” Fine told Newsmax, “and what we’ve learned in whether it’s dealing with Muslim terrorists or Democrats, you’ve gotta stand and you’ve gotta do the right thing.”

Investigating donor networks

Republicans’ keenness to label Democrats as terrorists comes two weeks after Trump signed an executive order declaring a left-wing antifascist movement, known as antifa, as a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not exist under U.S. law.

The order, which opened a new front in Trump’s battle against his political foes, also threatened to investigate and prosecute individuals who funded “any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of antifa.”

Leavitt told reporters Monday that the administration is “aggressively” looking into who is financially backing these operations.

Trump has floated the possibility of going after people such as George Soros, a billionaire who has supported many left-leaning causes around the world.

“If you look at Soros, he is at the top of everything,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance last month.

The White House has not yet made public any details about a formal investigation into donors, but Leavitt said the administration’s efforts are underway.

“We will continue to get to the bottom of who is funding these organizations and this organized anarchy against our country and our government,” Leavitt said. “We are committed to uncovering it.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36854e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5846x3069+0+414/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2F1a%2F378d89684f7295b3d0463342b726%2Ftrump-24897.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 21:56:30.533423

At a panel meeting last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Trump brazenly instructed the attorney general to go after his perceived political enemies, including Comey, Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
That indictment came after Trump made the post demanding that the Justice Department prosecute him.
“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said in the post, addressing the attorney general by her first name.
“In my almost six years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the department,” Schiff posted on social media.","A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday is poised to offer an unusual face-off: Sen. Adam B. Schiff, who says he’s being targeted by the president for political retaliation, asking questions of the attorney general whose department would sign off on any charges.

Schiff and the other committee Democrats criticized President Donald Trump’s calls last month to indict Schiff and others, as well as an actual indictment of former FBI Director James B. Comey, as brazen use of the Justice Department’s power to intimidate political foes.

“This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Nixon had his enemies list, but it wasn’t so exhaustive and blatant as this,” Schiff said in a television interview about a Trump social media post that demanded his prosecution. “It’s an effort to try to silence and intimidate people, but I refuse to be silenced or intimidated.”

Trump directed his call for prosecutions at Attorney General Pamela Bondi, who is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time since her confirmation hearing in January.

It’s one of a panoply of issues that Democrats could pick from to ask Bondi, a close Trump ally. Bondi is navigating a torrent of controversies as attorney general, including a decision not to disclose investigative materials related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, the pushing out and firing of career DOJ officials and her role in pressing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement.

Bondi could also face questions from Democrats about what happened with an investigation in which the administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash during an FBI sting last year, an incident reported by MSNBC.

At a panel meeting last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Trump brazenly instructed the attorney general to go after his perceived political enemies, including Comey, Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

“He ordered the Justice Department to go after the sitting attorney general in the state of New York, and he even ordered the entire Justice Department to go after a member of this committee,” Klobuchar said. “And if that is not chilling to my colleagues and they don’t care about this, I don’t even know what to say anymore.”

Federal prosecutors located in Maryland are looking into mortgage fraud accusations alleged by Trump allies against Schiff, according to The Washington Post. Schiff’s legal team has denied wrongdoing, and the former House member has said he is a target for his work on an impeachment of Trump and on a House select panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary panel have also criticized a federal grand jury indictment against Comey on charges he lied to Congress and obstructed a congressional proceeding. That indictment came after Trump made the post demanding that the Justice Department prosecute him.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said in the post, addressing the attorney general by her first name. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

The indictment came days after the Justice Department replaced Erik Siebert, who was leading the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia, with White House aide Lindsey Halligan. Trump took credit for pushing out Siebert.

“In my almost six years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the department,” Schiff posted on social media. “The DOJ is now little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign.”

Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a floor speech that he opened an investigation calling for answers from Bondi about the Comey indictment.

“The American people deserve to know if the chief law enforcement agency of the United States is following the Constitution or pursuing political revenge,” Durbin said.

While Comey is a target today, “tomorrow it could be our fellow citizens who dare to even criticize the policies of the Trump regime,” Durbin said.

And Durbin asked for help from Republicans.

“It’s time for the Republicans to join Democrats and step up and say enough is enough,” Durbin said. “This is a code-red alarm for the rule of law, and unless we come together to stop the president’s abuses, I fear this administration will continue to corrode our American democracy.

The special agent, who works deportations in New England, told Fox News Digital that sanctuary policies banning ICE agents from using police departments or other city areas for staging often forces agents to be exposed, having to prepare for missions in public areas.

The agent explained that if ICE does not have a nearby office and is barred from using city grounds, ""that means you're stuck with, ‘Okay, I'm going to go to a supermarket. I'm going to go to some office park if I can find one, maybe a park while I don my vest and all that, and I'm getting briefed.""

On Monday, Johnson, a Democrat, signed an executive order prohibiting the use of city parking lots and garages for civil immigration enforcement staging areas, processing locations or operations bases.

Johnson touted the order as establishing ""ICE-free zones."" Speaking at a press conference for the signing on Monday, he said the order also enables ""unwilling private businesses"" to refuse ICE agents’ use of their property to stage for operations. He said the order is ""aimed at reining in this out-of-control administration.""

""If the federal government violates this executive order, we will take them to court,"" Johnson said, urging Trump to leave Chicago ""the freak alone.""

In a statement posted on X, Johnson accused ICE agents of ""detaining elected officials, tear-gassing protestors, children, and Chicago police officers, and abusing Chicago residents.""

""With this Executive Order, Chicago stands firm in protecting the Constitutional rights of our residents and immigrant communities and upholding our democracy,"" Johnson wrote.

CHICAGO MAYOR VOWS CITY POLICE 'WILL NOT EVER COOPERATE WITH ICE'

The White House responded by issuing a blistering statement in which it called the order ""a disgusting betrayal of every law-abiding citizen.""

The White House called the order a ""sick policy"" that ""coddles criminal illegal alien killers, rapists, and gangbangers who prey on innocent Americans.""

""Shielding the most depraved, violent criminal illegal aliens from justice is not only an insult to every Chicagoan, it’s also a dangerous intensification of Democrats’ lunatic ‘sanctuary’ agenda where criminal illegals come before American citizens,"" said the White House statement.

According to the agent, Chicago is not the only sanctuary city that bars ICE from using municipal property to stage immigration enforcement operations.

""What does that leave you with in an urban environment? You're going to go to a supermarket. Who's at a supermarket? Everyone and their grandmother,"" the agent said.

The agent also expressed concern over sanctuary policies keeping police departments from being able to assist if protesters get violent.

Saturday morning, two men appearing to be U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stopped in the middle of the street, blocking traffic near 63rd and Kostner, and approached a white car. What happened next was all caught on video.

""The first thing I saw was they were pinning him against the car. Both of the guys were struggling to subdue him and try to take him to the ground,"" Hassan said.

Within seconds, the scene grows louder, with neighbors rushing out, yelling for agents to stop.

""The whole neighborhood came out to support this guy, or to stop what was going on,"" Hassan said.

At one point, the man the agents grabbed appeared to be on all fours and an agent wound up on his back. The man appeared to grab one of the agent's radios and throw it toward a bystander.

Moments later, an agent tried to zip-tie his hands, but the man tossed those away.

""I yelled, 'Let him go,' I mean, because there's certain ways and proper ways of conducting what you're doing, but you're dealing with another human being,"" Hassan said. ""Everything happened so quick, and he looked very scared.""

Hassan said a crowd gathered, shouting for the agents to stop.

The video later shows the agents suddenly release the man before they drive off. It's unclear why they let him go.

""Along the way, in trying to take him into custody they discovered they didn't have the basis to do it – somebody may have been challenging them at the scene,"" said Dr. Arthur Lurigio, a criminology professor at Loyola University.

What prompted the stop is unclear.

Surveillance footage from Hassan's shop shows a white car stopped moments before the struggle. Agents are seen speaking to the driver, then opening the back doors.

Lurigio said it appears possible the agents were not properly trained on how to detain a suspect.

""He wasn't able to subdue the man. He was putting up some resistance, and he was complaining about being grabbed on to, but the guy grabbing on to him didn't know how to get him down, and how steady him and hold him in place,"" Lurigio said.

He also pointed to another problem: one of the agents was dressed in plain clothes, not a uniform.

""He had nothing to identify who he was. Why he was there? Where he was from? That's a mystery. It should never be a mystery if a person's freedom is being taken away from them on the street,"" he said. ""They were trying to grab this man, for whatever reason, and to place him under arrest.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi of the University of Chicago's Department of Comparative Human Development was arrested on Oct. 3 and charged with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor, the Cook County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday to Fox News Digital.

Abdelhadi was released from custody after her initial appearance on Saturday.

OVER A DOZEN ARRESTED AT ANTI-ICE PROTESTS IN CHICAGO SUBURB

Court records show her next scheduled hearing is Tuesday.

A university spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdelhadi is an associate professor at the school.

Left-wing agitators have been rallying outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, for weeks. Rioters have blocked ICE vehicles from exiting the facilities, and have been involved in a slew of violent confrontations with police, leading to more than a dozen arrests.

Posts from Abdelhadi's X account show that she was at the rally on Friday. In her last post at 8:52 a.m., she took a photo of a line of Illinois State Police officers, and accused the state of ""enforcing Trump’s agenda of terrorizing our community with abductions.""

She has not posted since.

A day before her arrest, she appeared on a podcast called ""Movement Memos,"" which is affiliated with the far-left publication Truthout. During that interview, she recalled her previous experiences at the riots at the Broadview facility.

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they’re setting up shop,"" she said, referring to federal immigration officials. ""I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community. And so it felt really important to join protesters out there to say, not in our city, not in our name, not in our backyard.""

She later expressed her frustration at centrist liberals.

""There’s no center left,"" she said. ""You’re either resisting or you’re complicit.""

Abdelhadi made headlines earlier this year when she cursed out her employer at a July conference called Socialism 2025.

""F--- the University of Chicago, it’s evil, you know it’s a colonial landlord. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that,"" she said.

However, she reasoned that teaching there was her only chance to have any power.

""Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. That’s possible structural leverage,"" she said.

Socialism 2025 described itself as a ""a four-day conference bringing together thousands of socialists and radical activists from around the country to take part in discussions about social movements, abolition, Marxism, decolonization, working-class history, and the debates and strategies for organizing today.""

""This is a painful lesson that a lot of us in the Palestine solidarity movement have been learning is that we don’t have power… what we don’t have is power… the question I’m asking myself, and I’m asking you to ask yourself, ‘is where can I actually build power?’"" she said at Socialism 2025.

Local police can't compete with ICE promises The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

""You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,"" the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. ""But in sanctuary cities, you're ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.""

The campaign - airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta - is part of ICE's $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump's Republican administration for ICE - a 10-fold increase in its current budget - as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress' failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration's top priority, is still flush with cash.

Millions spent on the 30-second ads

The ads open with video of each metro's familiar skyline and the narrator's voice announcing, for example, ""Attention, Miami law enforcement."" Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to ""join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,"" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that ""that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement ""unless legally required.""

Local police can't compete with ICE promises

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city's Police Officers Association, said he'd seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city's police department joining ICE instead.

""We can't compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,"" Diaz said. ""I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.""

The government shutdown could dampen ICE's recruitment hopes, he said.

""They're furloughing federal employees, and I don't think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don't know if they're going to receive a check or not,"" he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

""It's the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,"" said Walker, who's in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. ""That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.""

Even tourists have been drawn into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, startled by the sight of federal agents marching in camouflage last weekend through the upscale city’s Gold Coast, near the famed Magnificent Mile.

What began quietly in Chicago one month ago as a promise by the Trump administration to increase arrests of illegal immigrants is now being felt all over this city of 2.7 million people and in the broader metropolitan area encompassing millions more.

Tensions are flaring up like small, intense wildfires. At elementary schools on the West Side, parents have organized to stand guard at dismissal time. Some construction businesses are keeping their warehouse doors open to keep an eye out for ICE agents. Owners of small businesses are doing their own deliveries, to protect their Latino employees from driving through the city streets.

In Edgewater, on the Far North Side along Lake Michigan, a neighborhood listserv lit up with worries on Sunday over a helicopter circling the area. Could it be ICE, one person asked. Is there anything we can do, asked another.

Neighbors came out onto the streets of the Southwest Side on Saturday after a car crash involving federal agents and two motorists, who the Department of Homeland Security said were pursuing the agents recklessly. ICE agents responded with pepper balls and tear gas; the crowd, shouting and waving anti-ICE signs, remained until the federal agents finally left.

Restaurants have cut back hours or stopped making deliveries altogether, unwilling to risk the arrest of their employees.

“We can’t ask anyone to risk their safety just to serve bagels,” one restaurant, Bagel Miller, explained in a Facebook post explaining its closure last weekend.

Berto Aguayo, a lawyer and advocate for immigrants, described a month of rising tensions, political organizing and outright fear, as Mr. Trump’s dragnet ensnared U.S. citizens alongside illegal immigrants.

“Our family gatherings are filled with crying and trying to figure out how we get past this moment,” Mr. Aguayo said. “People are being terrorized. People are being attacked. That’s what it feels like.”

When he visits his mother’s home in Back of the Yards, a neighborhood on the Southwest Side, he said, he sees far fewer people walking around than usual. “Every single person who looks brown is scared,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06nat-chicago-scene-vhlj/06nat-chicago-scene-vhlj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 20:57:37.416915

The US supreme court has ruled for Trump in a startlingly high percentage of cases this year.
In contrast, the supreme court ruled 93.7% of the time for Trump (15 out of 16 cases), often without taking a close look at the facts.
Roberts and the conservatives are “scared out of their minds that they will have to play chicken with Trump”, Levitsky said.
“The [US] supreme court hasn’t wanted to be Churchill.” Levitsky said.","Two 0f the world’s best-known authoritarian leaders – Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president – have each had at least 15 years at their country’s helm to pack the courts with loyalists and to pressure and intimidate judges. And no surprise, judges in those countries have repeatedly done what Orbán and Erdoğan want.

Donald Trump has not had the opportunity to pack the US supreme court to nearly the same degree. Nor has he, despite his brash, bullying ways, done much to pressure or browbeat the court’s nine justices. Nevertheless, the court’s conservative supermajority has ruled time after time in favor of Trump since he returned to office. The six conservative justices have fallen into line much like Hungary’s and Turkey’s judges, even though the supreme court’s justices have life tenure to insulate them from political pressures.

With the court’s new term beginning on Monday, many Americans are dismayed that the conservative justices have been so submissive to Trump, the most authoritarian-minded president in US history. Notwithstanding the US’s celebrated system of checks and balances, the justices have utterly failed to provide the checks on Trump that many legal scholars had expected. In ruling for Trump, the chief justice, John Roberts, and the other conservatives have let him gut the Department of Education, fire Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board members, and strip temporary protected status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The rightwing supermajority has also let Trump halt $4bn in foreign aid, fire tens of thousands of federal employees despite contractual protections and deport people to countries where they have no connection.

In these and other cases, the supermajority has ceded huge power to Trump, for instance, by greatly reducing Congress’s constitutional power over spending as it let Trump unilaterally gut agencies and halt funding approved by Congress. What’s more, the court seems eager to snuff out independent, nonpartisan federal agencies by letting Trump fire agency chairs and commissioners without giving any reason, even though Congress approved laws explicitly saying those officials could only be dismissed for cause. (Pleasing corporate America, the court ordered last Wednesday that Lisa Cook can remain on the Federal Reserve Board, at least temporarily, while litigation proceeds over whether Trump can fire her as part of his effort to end the central bank’s independence.)

“The chief justice is presiding over the end of the rule of law in America,” said J Michael Luttig, a highly regarded conservative former federal appellate judge.

The conservative justices have repeatedly done Trump’s bidding even though they don’t begin to face the intense pressures that Hungary’s and Turkey’s judges face. Erdoğan has sometimes purged and blackballed judges seen as insufficiently loyal, while Orbán’s high-ranking allies have berated less obedient judges as “traitors”.

The US supreme court has ruled for Trump in a startlingly high percentage of cases this year. It has issued 24 decisions from its emergency docket (often without giving any reasons) and ruled in Trump’s favor about 90% of the time.

In doing so, the court has repeatedly vacated injunctions that lower courts had issued after concluding that Trump, with his 209 executive orders, had egregiously broken the law. Adam Bonica, a Stanford political science professor, found that in Trump administration cases decided between 1 May and 23 June, federal district courts ruled against Trump 94.3% of the time (82 out of 87 cases), often after looking closely at the facts. In contrast, the supreme court ruled 93.7% of the time for Trump (15 out of 16 cases), often without taking a close look at the facts.

“The supreme court has pulled the rug out from under the lower federal courts, and it has done so deliberately and knowingly,” Luttig said, adding that the court is “acquiescing in and accommodating the president’s lawlessness”.

With the court siding so often with Trump, a new Gallup poll found that a record high 43% of Americans think the court is too conservative, higher than the 36% who think the court is “about right”. Moreover, the court’s overall approval rating has fallen to its lowest level since Gallup began measuring, dropping below 40% for the first time in August (before climbing slightly) – and down from nearly 60% in the early 2000s.

Steven Levitsky, a political science professor at Harvard and co-author of How Democracies Die, voiced bewilderment that the court has been so obliging toward a president who he says is a clear threat to democracy. According to Levitsky, courts come under the thumb of authoritarian governments in several ways. One way is “ideological agreement”. He said the court’s most rightwing members, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, seem in fundamental agreement with Trump, but he said the other conservatives do not love Trump even if they often rule for him. Levitsky suggested that those justices are so hostile toward liberals and liberal arguments that they gravitate towards Trump’s side in case after case.

Court packing is another way courts fall under an authoritarian’s sway. Orbán, Erdoğan and their legislative allies have appointed the overwhelming majority of their countries’ judges, while Trump has appointed three of the nine justices. With life tenure, the justices should in theory feel free from political pressure and able to rule against Trump. In the past, many justices have ruled against the presidents and parties that appointed them.

Levitsky sees another phenomenon at work: abdication. Pointing to both Congress and the supreme court, he said: “The major institutions that have the authority and responsibility to stand up and stop an authoritarian have declined to do so.”

In his view, the conservative justices may have made a major miscalculation. “They are overconfident about the strength of our institutions,” Levitsky said. “They don’t really think our democracy is in danger. They don’t think it can really happen here. I really think a majority of members of the US establishment are in that camp.”

The conservative justices have increasingly embraced the unitary executive theory, a once fringe, four-decade-old notion that the president has sole, unlimited authority over the executive branch and should, for instance, be free to fire members of independent agencies along with hundreds of thousands of federal employees. “If they really believed that Trump was a threat to democracy, they wouldn’t be giving him so much power,” Levitsky said.

The court’s conservatives, Levitsky and many legal scholars say, are also engaged in appeasement. Roberts and the conservatives are “scared out of their minds that they will have to play chicken with Trump”, Levitsky said. “The worst thing for them is if the government ignores them and they don’t have any authority. They’re just terrified that Trump will trample on them and undermine their authority. Trump is not someone you want to play chicken with. They’re terrified of a big, high-profile fight with Trump.”

In other words, the conservative justices are so eager to save face and avoid confrontation that they have often given a green light to what lower courts have seen as Trump’s lawlessness. Meanwhile, the three liberal justices – Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – have written repeated, often angry dissents that chastise the supermajority for acquiescing to Trump’s lawlessness and steamrolling over parts of the constitution.

One theory is that the conservative justices are deliberately giving Trump small victories – vacating lower courts’ injunctions and letting the president’s executive orders proceed and do their damage – as the justices wait for those cases to return to the supreme court, perhaps in a year or two. At that point, those cases would be fully briefed and argued, and the court would issue formal, longer rulings. Legal scholars hope, but are not optimistic, that the thus far compliant court will be more willing to defy Trump when the cases are fully briefed and argued, with the birthright citizenship and tariff cases most often mentioned.

“What they’re doing,” Levitsky said, “is giving Trump small victories in an effort to placate him or preserve as much political capital for when the big fights come. It’s appeasement. Appeasement usually doesn’t work when you cede power to an authoritarian executive. It sends signals to society that no one is going to stop the guy. Ceding power to someone like Trump is really dangerous.”

After Jair Bolsonaro, a rightwing Trump ally, was elected Brazil’s president in 2019, Alexandre de Moraes, a prominent member of Brazil’s supreme court, feared what he saw as Bolsonaro’s authoritarian tendencies. De Moraes cracked down on Bolsonaro’s efforts to spread disinformation on social media to undermine his opponents. When a mob of Bolsonaro’s allies stormed government buildings in January 2023, pushing for a coup d’etat, de Moraes led efforts to prosecute Bolsonaro. (Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison after being convicted of plotting a coup.)

“When Bolsonaro got elected, de Moraes realized that he’s a threat to democracy,” Levitsky said. “He thought that the Brazilian supreme court could be Chamberlain or Churchill.” (Neville Chamberlain, a British prime minister, agreed to let Adolf Hitler take over a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, as part of the Munich agreement, infamously declaring that the agreement would assure “peace for our time”.)

“The [US] supreme court hasn’t wanted to be Churchill.” Levitsky said. “John Roberts has been Chamberlain. I think that is incredible destructive behavior.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02c2359b2a5287f69282d9d90348a44a1613c2e/463_0_4629_3703/master/4629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2b469ddf683dc32224f468ab95d26584",N,,2025-10-06 23:56:18.027241

Reporting from the U.S. Capitol

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said tonight that she's circulating a discussion draft of a plan to reopen the government, one that would include a commitment to Democrats that Congress will address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.

The draft “suggests that there be a conversation on the ACA extension for the premium tax credits after we reopen government, but there would be a commitment to having that discussion,” she told a small group of reporters.

Collins indicated that she had the document in a folder as she walked off the Senate floor, but she would not show it to reporters.

Collins said she has circulated the draft “selectively,” and that she’s had conversations with both Republicans and Democrats. The senator said the draft would include passing the first package of three full-year appropriations bills, with a commitment to do another package of spending measures soon. Congress needs to pass 12 appropriation bills to fully fund the government.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News that bipartisan huddles forming on the Senate floor last week didn’t happen today. “It feels like we lost the momentum from last week,” she said.

Murkowski agreed with Collins’ approach that Democrats need assurance that ACA subsidies will be addressed — after Democrats deliver the votes needed to reopen the government.

“They need to know that there’s a framework here, and that’s what many of us have been talking about,” Murkowski said. “It’s like, OK, if you vote to open up the government, you know that this is kind of the way that we’re going to move to reconcile some of the things that we’ve been talking about.”

She also criticized the strategy of the Senate voting on the same two stopgap bills, calling it “Groundhog Day here.” The Senate tonight voted for the fifth time on two procedural motions: the House-passed stopgap bill and a Democratic alternative. Both votes failed.

“I think you got to have some understanding by the Democrats that are going to change their vote, that there’s a path here, and they want to know what that path is,” Murkowski said. “And so we got to be talking.”

Sen. Angus King considers opposing GOP funding measure in next vote

+2

, and

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told NBC News tonight that he is considering flipping his vote on the House-passed stopgap bill if Republicans don't address Democratic concerns about Medicaid cuts.

King, who caucuses with the Democrats and has voted in favor of passing the GOP stopgap five times, said he could flip his vote to a no “unless the Republicans are more forthcoming about dealing with the ACA problem,"" referring to the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

“The best we got was last Friday when [Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.] said he was open to conversations. That’s not good enough. We need to deal with this problem,” King said.

Other senators offered mixed reactions tonight after the Senate failed to reopen the government on Day 6 of the shutdown.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who voted with the Republicans to keep the government open in March but has voted against this GOP funding bill, said she sees a “sincere effort” among Republicans to reach a deal.

“There continue to be a lot of bipartisan conversations with people, and I think those will continue,” Shaheen said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had a less optimistic view. “The Republicans won’t talk when the government is open. The Republicans won’t talk when the government is closed. This is just not working,” she said.

Asked whether he’s open to working to reach a deal on health care before the government is reopened, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said, “I think what we need to do is reopen the government right now, not deal with this temper tantrum.”

FAA reports staffing issues at airports as government shutdown continues

The Federal Aviation Administration was experiencing staffing issues or anticipating shortages at airports and other air traffic control facilities in the United States tonight.

Reports of the staffing shortfalls came hours after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that there has been a slight increase in sick calls since the government shutdown began.

No air traffic controllers were expected at the tower at Hollywood Burbank Airport in the Los Angeles area for an hourslong stretch today night because of staffing issues, a source familiar with the situation said.

The FAA’s website showed the staffing issue between 4 p.m. and 9:59 p.m. PT (7 pm. Monday to 12:59 a.m. Tuesday ET).

Trump participates in tele-rally for his pick in tomorrow's Tennessee special election primary

Trump joined a telephone rally tonight for Matt Van Epps, a candidate in tomorrow’s GOP primary to determine the Republican nominee for a December special election for a House seat in a deep-red Tennessee district.

Trump reaffirmed his endorsement for Van Epps on the call, boasting the candidate's résumé as a former Army helicopter pilot who's now a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee National Guard.

He also said Van Epps supported his “campaign to restore law and order to our cities and towns.” Trump recently established a task force to mobilize the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee.

“Right now, we’re in Memphis. We’re going to Chicago, where you have rampant crime, even though you have a governor that says, ‘everything is wonderful,’” Trump said of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, whose state sued the administration today to prevent the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to Chicago.

Senate again rejects the House-passed GOP funding bill

and

A second vote tonight, to consider the House-passed Republican funding bill, failed in the Senate. That means the shutdown will extend into tomorrow.

The procedural motion failed 52-42. It needed 60 votes to advance. Three Democrats voted for it, and one Republican voted against it. Five senators missed the vote.

When the Senate last voted on the measure, on Friday, three senators in the Democratic caucus — Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman and Angus King — joined Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against it. Those senators voted the same way tonight.

It's the fifth time the Senate has rejected the measure. The so-called clean bill would fund the government through Nov. 21.

Trump weighed in right after the Senate vote, accusing Democrats of shutting down the government while indicating willingness to negotiate with them on health care policies, which Democrats have cited as the reason they rejected the House-passed bill.

""I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Democrats have said they want issues like health care dealt with before they vote to reopen the government.

Senate rejects Democratic funding for the fifth time

and

The Senate voted down a procedural motion to move forward with a Democratic alternative to the House-passed GOP stopgap funding bill.

The measure failed along party lines, 45-50. It needed 60 votes to pass.

This is the fifth time the Senate has rejected the measure.

The vote, had it succeeded, would have started consideration of a bill to fund the government through Oct. 31, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, money to offset Medicaid cuts from Trump's Big Beautiful Bill and funding for lawmaker security.

Hakeem Jeffries says he hasn't 'heard a word' from the White House since last week's meeting

and

Reporting from the U.S. Capitol

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters that neither he nor Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had “heard a word” from the White House since their Oval Office meeting last week.

He said he doesn't know of any Democrat who has spoken to Trump about reopening the government.

“Both House and Senate Democrats are clear, we’ll sit down anytime, anyplace, with anyone from your administration, including the president, to get a resolution here with respect to the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which need to be extended right now, as well as dealing with and addressing the Republican health care crisis that is devastating everyday Americans all across the country,” Jeffries said.

Utah lawmakers pass new GOP-backed congressional map

Utah lawmakers passed new congressional district lines today that seek to protect the state’s all-Republican delegation after a court ordered them to draw a new map ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Under the proposed map, Salt Lake County — the most Democratic part of Utah — would be split into two districts, rather than divided among the current four. Those two districts are expected to still lean Republican, but they could be more competitive for Democrats, while the two others in the state would remain solidly GOP.

The map, which a redistricting committee advanced this morning before the full Legislature passed it as part of special session later in the day, will still need to be signed by GOP Gov. Spence Cox and approved by the district court that demanded new lines.

The court ruled in August that the state must follow a 2018 ballot measure passed by voters, which prohibited gerrymandering; required lawmakers to keep counties, cities and communities of interest together whenever possible; and draw compact districts.

Trump says he would make a deal with Democrats 'if we made the right deal'

and

Trump suggested this afternoon that he would be open to making a deal with Democrats on a funding bill to reopen the government, without specifying under what terms or with what concessions such an agreement could be made.

“We are speaking with the Democrats, and some very good things could happen with respect to health care,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Asked whether he would be willing to make a deal with Democrats on Affordable Care Act subsidies, Trump responded: ""If we made the right deal, I’d make a deal.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded by discussing health care funding that Democrats have been pushing for, saying, ""Trump’s claim isn’t true — but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table.""

“If President Trump and Republicans are finally ready to sit down and get something done in healthcare for American families, Democrats will be there — ready to make it happen,"" Schumer added in a statement.

Trump says he will 'look at' Ghislaine Maxwell case after Supreme Court rejected her appeal

Trump said this afternoon that he plans to speak with the Justice Department about the Supreme Court's decision to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein who was convicted on child sex-trafficking charges in 2022.

Asked in the Oval Office whether he would consider a pardon for Maxwell, Trump told reporters: ""I haven’t heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I’d have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look.""

Asked to confirm whether he was considering such an action, Trump responded: ""I wouldn’t consider it or not consider. I don’t know anything about it.""

He also was asked why Maxwell would be considered at all as a candidate for clemency. “I don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I’d have to speak to the DOJ. I’ll look at it.”

Epstein survivors last month urged Trump to rule out a pardon for Maxwell and release documents related to Epstein’s case.

Illinois officials using Trump remarks to generals against him

and

Illinois officials and the lawsuit they filed to block the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard are pointing to Trump's remarks to the military last week to push back against his claim that he's only concerned about crime in the city.

""The federal government has been extremely clear that they’re taking this action not to assist Illinois and local officials but to use Chicago as a training ground for the military to fight what they dub the war from within,"" Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said at a news conference with Gov. JB Pritzker and other elected officials.

The suit brought by Attorney General Kwame Raoul's office refers to the remarks, as well, saying Trump told the military leaders ""they must prioritize 'defending the homeland' against the 'invasion from within' in American cities run by 'radical-left Democrats,' specifically including Chicago. He stated his intention to use our neighborhoods 'as training grounds for our military.'""

In his unusual address to the nation's military leaders last week, Trump said he'd told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military, because we’re going into Chicago very soon. That's a big city with an incompetent governor, stupid governor.”

Pritzker says Trump 'thuggery' making Chicago less safe

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said today he doesn't want the National Guard in his state because the Trump administration's safety efforts to date have made Chicago less safe.

""Our people have been subjected to violence, intimidation and harassment"" since Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection surged federal law enforcement into the city last month, Pritzker told reporters, accusing the government of zip-tying children and targeting people because of the color of their skin, including U.S. citizens.

""They have struck fear in our communities, including notably, fear in the hearts of U.S. citizens. Trump and the thuggery his agents have brought have actively made us less safe,"" Pritzker said.

House Oversight cancels Comey deposition on Epstein

Former FBI Director James Comey is no longer scheduled for a deposition with the House Oversight Committee as part of its Jeffrey Epstein investigation after Comey submitted a letter saying he has no relevant “knowledge and information” about the matter.

In his letter to committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., Comey writes: “At no time during my service at the Department of Justice or the FBI do I recall any information or conversations that related to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”

The letter, provided to NBC News by a spokesperson for the committee, is subject to 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which fines and/or imprisons a person who “knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up” false statements.

The committee withdrew its subpoena and canceled the deposition with Comey, which was originally planned for tomorrow. The committee did the same last week with former Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Andrew Cuomo says electing Zohran Mamdani would be a 'gift' to Trump

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on ABC’s ""The View"" this morning that electing his Democratic primary opponent for New York mayor, Zohran Mamdani, would be a ""gift"" to Trump.

""It's good for Donald Trump because it's the excuse he needs to take over New York, which he has said he will do,"" Cuomo said.

""Going into the midterms, [Trump] will take a picture of Mamdani around the country and say: 'Here’s what happened to the Democrats. They are now communists. They hate the police, they legalized prostitution, legalized drugs,'"" Cuomo warned.

The Mamdani campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Cuomo framed himself instead as the ""last person"" Trump wants as mayor, saying he and Trump ""fought on a daily basis"" during the pandemic.

Trump says trucks to face 25% tariff Nov. 1

Trump said on Truth Social that medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States will be subject to a 25% tariff starting Nov. 1.

Trump had said the tariff would take effect last Wednesday, but that date came and went without the White House's releasing any executive orders to institute the levy.

Mexico, a top-three U.S. trading partner, is the largest exporter of such trucks to the United States.

Trump also planned a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports starting last Wednesday, but the White House said later that it would ""begin preparing"" the tariff on that date, rather than imposing it.

Leavitt denies Trump plans to take over cities with military

During her news briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Trump wants to take over Democratic-led cities with the military or National Guard, saying that Democratic mayors shouldn't be concerned about a long-term military or National Guard presence in their cities.

""You guys are framing this like the president wants to take over the American cities with the military,"" Leavitt said. ""The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities, and we have already seen there’s a positive formula for that.""

Leavitt pointed to the National Guard deployment in Washington as a key example of the crime-fighting effort.

""The murder rate has declined significantly,"" Leavitt said. ""Our streets are safer. People who live here feel safer — all of you in this room, I know you do, you just won’t admit it,"" Leavitt said. ""It’s a proven system that works, and the president wants to make America city safe again. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.""

White House says FBI, Treasury and the intelligence community are investigating antifa

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the briefing that the investigation into the far-left, decentralized antifa movement and the financial backing of it and associated groups is taking place across the administration.

""The FBI is working on it, alongside the White House's Homeland Security Task Force,"" she said. ""We have our intelligence community looking into this as well, and even the secretary of treasury is involved with these matters, since they are financial in nature, and we will continue to get to the bottom of who is funding these organizations in this organized anarchy against our country and our government.""

Leavitt warns that WIC, SNAP will exhaust funds 'very soon'

At the beginning of the briefing, Leavitt warned that if the Senate fails to reopen the government tonight, key federal food assistance programs for low-income households and pregnant women will run out of money.

""The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children will run out of federal money very soon,"" Leavitt said. ""It can be easily fully funded if Democrats simply vote tonight to reopen the government.""

White House says Trump has spoken to GOP leaders in Congress amid shutdown

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has spoken to GOP leaders in Congress amid the ongoing government shutdown.

Asked what the president has been doing today to resolve the shutdown, she said Trump ""was on the phone with Speaker Johnson. He's also spoken with the Senate majority leader, who are in touch with, of course, moderate Democrats and Democrats across the board, who we understand, hopefully, want to do the right thing by their constituents to reopen the government.

""So the president is being kept very well apprised of the ongoing shutdown on Capitol Hill,"" Leavitt said.

Trump holds phone call with Brazil's president about tariffs and the economy

Trump held a phone call with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this morning and discussed the economy, tariffs and trade.

Lula said in a post on X that he asked Trump to lower the steep 40% tariffs on his country and said that Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to negotiate further. He also expressed a willingness to travel to the United States for further talks, Brazil's government said in a statement.

Trump commented on the call in a Truth Social post, writing that ""we will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future.""

Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Brazil in part because of the legal case surrounding his political ally, and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was convicted of an attempted coup last month and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison.

Trump’s presidential library fund is dissolved as a Florida nonprofit for apparent failure to file mandatory report

The Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc. appears to have been administratively dissolved as a Florida state nonprofit corporation last month because it failed to file an annual report with state officials.

According to records on the Florida Department of State website, the dissolution took effect Sept. 26. The fund was first established in Trump’s home state in December.

A lawyer listed as representing the library fund declined to comment. Annual reports are due by the third Friday in September in Florida.

At the federal level, Trump’s presidential library is managed by the National Archives and Records Administration, which does the same for all presidents.

Dissolved business entities are technically “prohibited by statute from engaging in any activities other than those necessary to liquidate its assets and wind up its affairs,” according to the business services firm Wolters Kluwer.

“But despite this prohibition, it is not unusual to see an administratively dissolved business entity continuing to operate as a going concern, because the people who are acting on its behalf are unaware that it has been dissolved,” the firm notes on its website.

Illinois sues the Trump administration over National Guard deployment to Chicago

and

The state of Illinois filed a lawsuit today in an attempt to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the Illinois attorney general’s office wrote in the filing, which names Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll as defendants.

Speaker Johnson rejects Hakeem Jeffries' call for a prime-time debate on the shutdown

and

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rejected House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' call for a prime-time debate on the House floor about the government shutdown.

""My friend Hakeem had his shot,"" Johnson said at a news conference this morning. ""We debated all this on the House floor."" Johnson added that Jeffries, D-N.Y., had previously spoken on the House floor for seven or eight minutes.

""He had all of his colleagues lined up. They gave it their best shot, and they argued, and they stomped their feet and screamed at us and all that,"" he continued. ""And still, we passed the bill in bipartisan fashion and sent it over to the Senate. The House has done its job.""

Jeffries proposed the idea in a letter to Johnson this morning. ""I write to challenge you to a debate on the Floor of the House of Representatives any day this week in primetime, broadcast live to the American people,"" it said.

Johnson said he spoke to the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Patty Murray, D-Wash., two days ago and told her he would agree to moving a package of spending bills on the floor once the shutdown impasse ends.

Treasury secretary and Social Security Administration chiefs to serve in dual roles at IRS

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that he would remain as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and was naming Frank Bisignano as the agency's chief executive officer

Bessent has been acting IRS commissioner since early August, while Bisignano has been the head of the Social Security Administration.

Multiple roles have become the norm in the Trump administration, with Budget Office Director Russell Vought also serving as the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also serving as national security adviser. Stephen Miran, the chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, is currently working as a Federal Reserve governor while on temporary unpaid leave from the White House.

The administration briefly discussed the idea of Bessent serving as Fed chair and Treasury Department chief at the same time, but he is now interviewing other candidates for Fed chair.

The New York City divide shaping its contentious mayoral race

New York City’s mayoral contest has fully surfaced a tension bubbling in city politics for years: the divide between lifelong New Yorkers and young professionals who have recently moved in.

In his 7-point Democratic primary win over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in June, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani cleaned up with younger voters who live in some of New York’s most gentrified neighborhoods — including Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant. Cuomo, meanwhile, edged out Mamdani in majority-Black, outer-borough neighborhoods that have experienced less gentrification, as well as other places like the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, also home to many longtime New Yorkers.

That divide is playing out in the general election, too, where Cuomo is running as a third-party candidate. A CBS News survey last month found that Mamdani held a 51-point edge over Cuomo among voters who have moved to New York within the last 10 years. Among voters who have lived in New York for more than 10 years, Mamdani’s advantage over Cuomo dropped to 19 points.

And among born and raised New Yorkers, Mamdani held a smaller, 7-point advantage over Cuomo. Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, two fixtures of New York politics for decades, combined to win 49% of this demographic.

Trump says federal layoffs are 'taking place right now'

and

Trump told reporters yesterday that federal employee layoffs were ""taking place right now, and it’s all because of the Democrats.""

The president did not elaborate on the extent of the layoffs. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said last week that the number of firings would likely be in the thousands.

Leavitt later clarified during an afternoon press briefing today that ""the president was referring to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed as a result of this federal government shutdown.""

Trump looms over Tennessee special election in a deep-red House district

As the special House election for a deep-red congressional district in Tennessee approaches, one issue has shaped the race above all else: Donald Trump.

A crowded field in Tuesday’s GOP primary to fill former Rep. Mark Green’s seat spent months fighting over who’s the most pro-Trump before Trump stepped in with an endorsement for Matt Van Epps at the end of last week. Other issues have fallen to the background, blurring the lines between candidates, while the increasing drumbeat of campaign ads largely revolved around support for Trump and his policies.

Trump and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn each carried the 7th District by about 20 points last year, making the Republican primary the main event in the special election to replace Green, who resigned this year.

But with campaigns expecting much lower turnout than usual because of the irregular election dates, it’s possible the Dec. 2 special general election could be a closer contest than the election was last year, like other special elections around the country this year.

The U.S. government shutdown entered its sixth day today with no end in sight after another round of blame games and sniping between leaders of the two parties on the Sunday talk shows.

Democratic and Republican leaders are locked in a standoff about the way forward as it takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass a bill, and the GOP needs five more Democrats to advance its bill to reopen the government temporarily.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called it a partisan bill written without Democratic input, demanding a negotiation to win the necessary votes from his party. But Republican leaders insist there will be no negotiation over their short-term bill.

NAACP spends to mobilize Black voters in California redistricting fight and New Jersey and Virginia governors' races

The NAACP will invest $750,000 to mobilize Black voters to cast ballots and monitor the polls ahead of key elections in three states this fall, the group exclusively told NBC News.

The group will spend a quarter-million dollars in California, where a new congressional map that would further boost Democrats is on the ballot, as well as in New Jersey and Virginia, which are hosting governors' races. The nonpartisan NAACP is not endorsing a candidate in New Jersey or Virginia.

In California, the NAACP will seek to reach 1.2 million voters and train at least 300 poll monitors in support of a mid-decade redistricting effort spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The California gerrymander comes in response to new GOP-drawn map in Texas, which the NAACP has sued over, calling it “racially motivated.”

In New Jersey, the NAACP plans to reach out to 175,000 voters in Newark, East Orange, Irvington, Trenton, Paterson, and Jersey City, as well as train at least 350 poll monitors ahead of the election between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

In Virginia, the group aims to engage and educate 300,000 voters and recruit 300 poll workers amid a high-profile race for the governor's mansion between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.

The White House confirmed the deportations on Monday, saying the individuals had committed serious crimes.

Neither the US nor Eswatini confirmed the nationalities of the individuals who arrived on Monday. However, US-based immigration lawyer Tin Thanh Nguyen said they included three people from Vietnam, one from the Philippines, and one from Cambodia.

Rights groups have condemned the treatment of the first group of deportees sent to Eswatini — which included individuals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba , and Yemen — saying they were kept in solitary confinement and not given access to lawyers.

Nguyen said he was representing two of those who arrived on Monday and two others previously sent to Eswatini, but he remained unable to speak with any of them.

“I cannot call them. I cannot email them. I cannot communicate through local counsel because the Eswatini government blocks all attorney access,” he said in a statement provided to Reuters news agency.

Amid its mass deportation push, the Trump administration has increasingly relied on sending deportees to third countries when they cannot legally send them to their homeland.

Rights advocates have challenged the practice, fearing it can leave those expelled stranded in countries where they do not speak the language and may not be afforded due process.

The Trump administration has also sent “third country” deportees to South Sudan, Ghana, and Rwanda.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the latest group of deportees sent to Eswatini had been convicted of “heinous crimes”, including murder and rape.

Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump’s use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”

An expanding role for the National Guard not seen before

Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump’s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Control over a state’s National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor’s objections. Otherwise, it’s up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He’s called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America’s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America’s cities safer.

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,’” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it’s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy’s move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it’s more symbolic than helpful.”

Legal challenges set up a clash over Trump’s deployments

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge’s decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it’s the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump’s immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump’s opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power.

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That’s our backstop. That’s what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump’s attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge’s weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” attorneys for Illinois wrote in the opening lines of a lawsuit today against Trump’s bid to send troops to Chicago.

That dynamic crystallized Saturday in the urgent warning by a Trump-appointed federal judge, not only about an immediate effort by Trump to send troops to Portland, Oregon, but by the implications of the administration’s argument about its legal basis for doing so.

“This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law,” U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut wrote. “Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Those arguments, she said, effectively boiled down to a limitless proposition: that “the President could send military troops virtually anywhere at any time.”

Immergut’s ruling set off a furious reaction from the White House and its allies, particularly Trump aide Stephen Miller, who cast Immergut’s ruling as an “insurrection” aimed at preventing Trump from stopping an “organized terrorist attack” against federal immigration officials.

“Today’s judicial ruling is one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen,” Miller said on X, describing the protests outside Portland ICE facilities as “a violent armed resistance designed to incapacitate the essential operations of the duly-elected federal government, by force.”

But Immergut emphasized in her ruling that the Trump administration had presented virtually no evidence of an unmanageable assault on federal property or personnel. Rather, the record showed clearly that police had managed the limited unrest, often in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, and had worked to respond when protests occasionally veered into violence.

A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Miller’s commentary, not for the first time, was at odds with the facts presented by the Trump administration itself in court. Far from describing a long-running sinister plot, Justice Department attorneys acknowledged a relatively subdued protester presence in Portland since June. Some spasms of violence — along with a general air of menace facing immigration authorities — justified Trump’s military call-up, they said.

In fact, Miller has frequently taken positions on immigration policy — often as he attacks Democratic-appointed judges — that are at odds with the facts the Justice Department presents in court.

For example, Miller accused U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan of effectively “kidnapping” Guatemalan kids that the Trump administration was trying to reunify with their parents. But the Justice Department told a different federal judge that in fact Miller’s premise was wrong: The Guatemalan government could not locate most of the parents of the kids the administration was trying to deport and that none had sought their return from the United States.

Miller has contended that the deportation of Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia — despite a court order barring him from being sent to his home country — was not an accident, despite numerous acknowledgments by the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Justice Department that Abrego’s deportation was a mistake.

Chief U.S. District Judge David G. Estudillo administered the oath of office. U.S. Attorney Floyd was appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi on September 16, 2025.

“Like many Northwesterners, I first experienced the beauty and outdoor opportunities in Washington while stationed at JBLM in the late 1990’s as part of the legal staff on the base,” said U.S. Attorney Floyd. “In 2009, I was able to make Western Washington my home while continuing my legal service to my country as part of the Army JAG Corps, as an attorney with the Department of Homeland Security, and later as an Immigration Judge with the Department of Justice.”

U.S. Attorney Floyd will lead an office of approximately 85 attorneys and 70 support staff. Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) enforce the criminal laws of the United States by directing investigations and prosecuting cases developed by a network of federal law enforcement agencies. The office also fills a critical role as legal counsel for the United States government in civil litigation and affirmative civil enforcement.

Following law school and a judicial clerkship, U.S. Attorney Floyd served in various legal roles while on active duty with the U.S. Army. In 2004, Mr. Floyd joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, and for over five years handled a wide range of federal criminal matters including violent crime, white-collar crimes, health care fraud, mail and wire fraud, bank embezzlement, child exploitation, immigration violations, and identity theft.

In 2009, U.S. Attorney Floyd and his family returned to Western Washington, and he served as Assistant Chief Counsel for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In that role he handled detention and removal proceeding before the Immigration Court and worked closely with Federal and local law enforcement to provide training on criminal and Constitutional issues.

Even as he served his country with DHS and DOJ, Mr. Floyd continued to serve in the Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps, as a reserve officer. In November 2015 he was deployed to Iraq for six months as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. He retired from the JAG Corps in 2023 at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

In 2018, Mr. Floyd was appointed to be an Immigration Judge in the Executive Office of Immigration Review, presiding over asylum, removal, and bond hearings.

Most recently, in March 2025, U.S. Attorney Floyd was called back to Washington DC to serve as Special Counsel for Immigration Enforcement in the FBI Office of General Counsel. In that role he advised the General Counsel and FBI leadership on all aspects of immigration enforcement. Mr. Floyd coordinated with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and all DOJ law enforcement components to provide guidance and training on the implementation of immigration enforcement priorities.

In a separate immigration court ruling last week, an immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his original immigration case.","The judge overseeing the Maryland deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on Monday denied the government's request to delay proceedings because of the government shutdown.

The ruling came Monday during a status conference held in the case of Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man deported in error to El Salvador last March and then returned back to the United States in June to face criminal charges in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said she she felt ""duty bound"" to continue the case given its importance and the fundamental questions it raises about deportation policies.

MORE: Judge denies motion to reopen Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immigration case

The government was prohibited from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, but now seeks to deport him to another country, including possibly Uganda or Eswatini. Judge Xinis has currently banned the government from removing Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys argued that the only reason for detention after there are orders of removal is to effectuate that removal. If there are no current plans for his imminent removal, they argued, then Abrego Garcia should be released from detention. Government attorneys pointed to previous court decisions that indicate they have six months' leeway.

Judge Xinis appeared exasperated Monday with government attorneys who could not answer if there was additional evidence about removal plans to Eswatini beyond letters sent to Abrego Garcia’s lawyers.

“That’s not a tenable position. You’ve either done it or you haven’t,” she said. “It’s not a hard question, guys”

Government attorneys were unable to find anyone who could address the judge's questions about what efforts had been made to remove Abrego Garcia to Eswatini, citing the government shutdown as one possible reason.

The judge gave the government until Wednesday afternoon to file any evidence about steps taken to remove Abrego Garcia to Eswatini. She also asked the government to provide witnesses who can speak firsthand to those efforts.

""I am asking you really basic questions,"" Xinis said. ""What's been done ... have you had any conversations?""

A hearing is scheduled for Friday.

""This case is not just about one man. It is about the integrity of the U.S. Constitution,"" Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, chief of organizing and leadership at the immigration rights group CASA, said at a press conference outside the courthouse prior to the hearing. ""We need to continue to raise collective conscience as we continue to witness the inhumane retaliation by our government to a man and his family who are simply demanding due process.""

Government lawyers had requested a stay of all deadlines related to the case due to the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.

Judge denies motion to reopen Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immigration case

""Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal Defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,"" Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in a court filing.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys had asked that the court deny the government's request, and also, in light of the government's position, to allow Abrego Garcia to be released from detention.

""The mere fact that the Government is seeking to extend all deadlines in this case indefinitely shows that there is no significant likelihood that Petitioner will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is no justification for continuing Petitioner's detention,"" his lawyers wrote in a reply.

Abrego Garcia is currently being detained at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Pennsylvania.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the United States from El Salvador in June to face criminal charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case released him into his brother's custody in Maryland. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials then indicated that he could potentially be deported to Uganda and ordered him to report to the ICE field office in Baltimore.

Timeline: Wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador

When Abrego Garcia arrived at the office, he was immediately taken into immigration custody.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers in the Tennessee case have filed a motion to dismiss based on their claim of the prosecution being vindictive. A judge this past week determined that the ""totality of events"" creates a sufficient basis that there was a ""realistic likelihood"" that the government may have acted vindictively and entitles Abrego Garcia to discovery and a hearing on the matter before the court makes a decision on the motion.

A status conference is set for Friday in Nashville.

In a separate immigration court ruling last week, an immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his original immigration case. His lawyers had argued that his deportation and return to the U.S. had reset the clock on making an asylum claim, but the judge did not agree, closing that potential path to preventing deportation.

Successive administrations have worked closely with Palantir, a data analytics and technology firm with federal contracts dating back to 2010, to expand the government’s technological capacity for immigration enforcement.
Even without AI, the sheer expansion of data collection by DOGE and federal immigration agencies has significant implications.
Social media screening criteria can be broadly interpreted, and intensified surveillance raises concerns about restricting free speech while setting an alarming precedent.","Mass deportations were a central promise of Donald Trump’s campaign, with one spokesperson vowing he would “marshal every federal and state power necessary” to achieve such goals. Since taking office, this has included invoking a wartime act and deploying the National Guard to support immigration raids amid protests in Los Angeles.

Behind the scenes, these efforts rely on the use of data analytics and several technologies. From social media surveillance to facial recognition, the administration is employing a variety of legacy technological tools and databases amassed during previous presidencies. But as the administration’s deportation efforts accelerate, it seems these technologies might streamline its goals and also become more powerful with artificial intelligence (AI).

Tech capabilities in immigration enforcement

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have ushered in technologies that can help power immigration enforcement. Nearing the end of Biden’s term, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported nearly 200 uses of AI across its departments, including approximately 20 active use cases by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These range from verifying information or finding potential errors in a data set through machine learning to routine uses of facial recognition technology. For example, ICE’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which allows people without legal status to live in the U.S. during removal proceedings, rather than be put in a detention facility, requires participants to log their whereabouts through an app called SmartLINK. Usually, this involves people taking a photo of themselves and uploading it to the app, which confirms migrants’ identities through facial recognition and their location at a designated place through GPS coordinates. ICE has also deployed AI for its “Hurricane Scores,” an algorithm designed to assess the likelihood that someone will fail to check in with the agency and to inform officers’ decisions during case reviews.

Other use cases include translation services, facial recognition technologies, and “commercially procured” tools like Babel software, which assists CBP in screening social media accounts to “identify potential threats.”

Technologies have also been deployed at the border itself. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) listed about 60 uses of AI in 2024, including autonomous surveillance towers that can detect and predict migration activity. DHS has also tested robodogs, which would be deployed at the southern border.

The expansion under Trump

These technologies adopted from previous administrations could be repurposed by the Trump administration, including in applications that extend beyond a technology’s original planned use case. Some planned use cases include drug smuggling, human trafficking, and transnational gang activity. The chief operating officer of Geo Group, a private prison firm that sells tracking technology to ICE, confirmed the Trump administration’s intention to monitor millions of individuals in removal proceedings, stating that the company has “assured ICE of our capability to rapidly scale up.”

The administration has already adapted several technology use cases to support its mass deportation efforts, including rebranding the “CBP One” app—which had granted immigration parole to nearly one million people since January 2023. In March, it was relaunched as “CBP Home” to encourage individuals to self-deport.

The administration has also adapted its methods of social media surveillance. Though agencies like the State Department have gathered millions of handles and monitored political discussions online, the Trump administration has been more explicit in who it’s targeting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new, zero-tolerance “Catch and Revoke” strategy, which uses AI to monitor the public speech of foreign nationals and revoke visas of those who “abuse [the country’s] hospitality.” In a March press conference, Rubio remarked that at least 300 visas, primarily student and visitor visas, had been revoked on the grounds that visitors are engaging in activity contrary to national interest. A State Department cable also announced a new requirement for student visa applicants to set their social media accounts to public—reflecting stricter vetting practices aimed at identifying individuals who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles,” among other criteria.

The Brennan Center for Justice reports that these plans could expand existing programs to collect social media handles from an additional 33 million people. The administration has already begun advancing such proposals—for instance, Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued a notice proposing the collection of social media identifiers through immigration forms. The State Department also intends to use these tools not only to identify potential legal violations but to screen for “antisemitic activity” or terrorist sympathies, without clearly defining those terms. This represents just one facet of the data the administration plans to use in its immigration crackdown.

Merging data sets

Although vast amounts of data on both U.S. citizens and noncitizens are already held across federal agencies, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sought to centralize some of this information into a shared repository, following an executive order from Trump calling for the elimination of “information silos.” According to Wired, DOGE intends to integrate data from agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into USCIS’s “data lake,” which contains information on immigration cases. Additional reports indicate that DOGE and ICE have also requested access to Medicare data to obtain immigrants’ addresses, despite nonresidents being ineligible for the program.

Successive administrations have worked closely with Palantir, a data analytics and technology firm with federal contracts dating back to 2010, to expand the government’s technological capacity for immigration enforcement. Since Trump took office, Palantir has received more than $113 million in federal funds, including $30 million in May to build “ImmigrationOS,” a database system designed to support “selection and apprehension operations” aligned with enforcement priorities, provide “real-time visibility into instances of self-deportation,” and manage logistics across the immigration process. The system is expected to prioritize violent criminals, gang members, and individuals who have overstayed their visas.

The risk of abuses

Criticism of the technologies used by the government to target immigrants has been well documented for years. A key concern with facial recognition, for example, is that it can exacerbate racial disparities in policing and increase the likelihood of misidentifying people of color, largely due to nonrepresentative training data. Some states, such as Illinois, have protections against the collection or use of biometric information through laws like Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, but no comparable protections exist at the federal level. The Trump administration also replaced Biden-era guidance on the use of AI in federal agencies with its own framework, largely maintaining continuity while consolidating “rights”- and “safety”-impacting AI into a single “high-impact” category. Civil liberties advocates argue that this designation is too narrow, excluding processes that still require human oversight despite the risks of “automation bias.”

AI can misclassify individuals’ criminal records, score people based on incomplete information, and introduce other forms of bias in law enforcement. Even without AI, the sheer expansion of data collection by DOGE and federal immigration agencies has significant implications. Privacy advocates warn that programs designed to facilitate the deportation of noncitizens may also affect U.S. citizens, since agencies must gather data on everyone to determine legal status. Facial recognition technologies used by federal law enforcement—including ClearView AI systems that collect and sell publicly available images—have already faced legal challenges in the U.S., France, and the Netherlands. Americans have limited privacy protections, as the country lacks comprehensive federal privacy legislation, and protections are weaker for noncitizens.

Furthermore, while everyone in the U.S. is theoretically entitled to First Amendment protections, noncitizen have been targeted in immigration proceedings for their speech and activism. Because AI may struggle to interpret nuance or context, using online speech as a basis for removal proceedings could have chilling effects on free expression and public discourse nationwide. Social media screening criteria can be broadly interpreted, and intensified surveillance raises concerns about restricting free speech while setting an alarming precedent. Individuals may self-censor, fearing repercussions for peaceful forms of government criticism, such as writing op-eds or participating in campus protests. Some universities have even advised international students to be cautious about their digital footprints.

The prior administration worked to establish voluntary guidance and nonbinding guardrails to promote the responsible and ethical design and deployment of these technologies in government. In the absence of stronger regulations and a national data privacy standard, however, the current administration has created a “wild west” regarding the repurposing and procurement of surveillance tools that support its immigration agenda.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2017-01-25T000000Z_1068917720_RC157D3D0FD0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MEXICO-1.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-10-06 17:57:46.852624

“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention.","As state legislators inside the Capitol in Hartford discussed the possibility of a special session on Monday, faith leaders and immigrant advocates rallied outside the building, urging the lawmakers to prioritize immigrant safety.

The large crowd had marched from the federal courthouse to the Capitol for their rally, with signs that read “Hands Off Our Neighbors” and “Gov. Lamont: Immigrant Protections Can’t Wait” and chanting “No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!”

In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, often wearing masks, have detained people across Connecticut, at federal courthouses, carwashes, and from their vehicles.

Many of the speakers at Monday’s rally were faith leaders in Connecticut. Reverend Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester, said that he, along with many advocates at the rally, had worked hard to put protections for immigrants into an updated version of the TRUST Act when lawmakers were in session earlier this year.

“It was infuriating when the bill that we wanted got out of the Judiciary Committee and then just got watered down. And so many of the good things that were in that bill — the things that immigrants needed to be safe in our state — went away in that strange way that laws get made in Connecticut,” Pawelek said.

Pawelek urged those gathered to scan a QR code distributed on flyers through the crowd that would link them to a page to write to lawmakers.

Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, also spoke at the rally. In his district, an August raid by masked ICE agents took place at a Newington car wash. Lesser said the state has the ability to better protect immigrants, but, “we need strong laws that apply equally to anyone who is depriving the civil rights of anyone in this state. Connecticut can play an important role, but we have a choice to make. And I’m hoping we do so soon.”

After the rally ended, Lesser said there are two schools of thought among lawmakers inside the Capitol: “One that Connecticut should take a more confrontational approach, and one that we should keep our heads down.” While Lesser said he understands why some lawmakers favor a more passive approach, “I just don’t think that’s going to work, I don’t think that’s how you stop a bully.”

Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, also spoke at Monday’s rally. She updated the crowd on the case of Victor Sanchez, an activist with Make the Road and HDD, who was detained in September when he arrived to federal court for a routine check-in.

“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention. But that news was tempered by the stipulation that Sanchez was given just 30 days to leave the country.

Segovia said her group planned to keep fighting for Sanchez to be able to stay in the U.S. She also read some words in both Spanish and English from Sanchez, who said he was blessed to be a member of the community.

“When I was in detention, I talked to people who didn’t have anything — no documents, prepared in packets, no communities or organizations rallying in support. The reason I am here today is because of all of my community support and the organizing of my community. That people united will never be defeated.”

Segovia told those gathered that lawmakers should act on several concerns the immigrant community has: “We need to protect our personal information from the federal government. Am I right? We need to protect our communities and make sure that our tax dollars are not being spent to assist immigration enforcement in Connecticut.”

Segovia also said that funding should be directed so that no one, regardless of immigration status, loses Medicaid coverage or access to food assistance programs.

Judiciary Committee Co-chair Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said in an interview that lawmakers would continue to look for ways to support immigrants in Connecticut, if given the opportunity during a special session, which must be called by Gov. Ned Lamont. “We’ll continue to try and do what we can to make sure people feel safe in our state, despite the threatening and frankly harassment coming from the federal government,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4934-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:57:50.889695

Where a petitioner has moved to stay an immigration judge’s deportation order, that motion should be denied because the petitioner has shown neither a likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable harm.

“An immigration judge issued a final order holding that Arsen Sarkisov, an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, is subject to deportation. Over six years later, Sarkisov moved to reopen his case, but the immigration judge denied that motion. Sarkisov appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which rejected his claim. In 2023, Sarkisov appealed the Board’s decision to our court. At the same time, he asked our court to stay the immigration judge’s deportation order for the duration of the appeal. The United States did not oppose this request for a stay. The case was then paused for almost a year while Sarkisov sought to negotiate a resolution with the government. But the litigation resumed when those efforts failed. Sarkisov’s motion for a stay is now before us.

“The traditional test for a stay governs an alien’s request for a stay of removal pending appeal. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009).

“To satisfy that burden, the applicant must show, among other factors, (1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his underlying appeal and (2) that he will be irreparably injured without a stay. … But these two factors ‘are the most critical.’

“Here, Sarkisov hasn’t met his burden. His two-page motion doesn’t show that he is entitled to a stay under Nken.

“Start with the first factor, likelihood of success on the merits. Far from persuading us that he is likely to succeed, Sarkisov’s stay motion doesn’t say anything at all about the merits. So he can’t establish this factor.

“Second, Sarkisov hasn’t offered a single reason why he would suffer irreparable harm without a stay. He offers only the conclusory assertion that ‘I will suffer irreparable harm if I am removed.’ … But removal from the United States ‘is not categorically irreparable.’ Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. When Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, it repealed a prior statute that prevented aliens who leave the United States from continuing to seek review of their removal orders. … Since litigants like Sarkisov are now free to continue pursuing their appeals from abroad if they are deported while the appeal is pending, ‘the burden of removal alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.’ … Thus, without any additional arguments showing why his removal during appeal would cause him irreparable harm, Sarkisov can’t satisfy this factor.

“Sarkisov’s failure to satisfy these two ‘most critical’ stay factors—likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm—dooms his motion. … In any event, Sarkisov has also failed to establish that his removal pending appeal would harm the public interest. ‘There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders.’ Nken, 556 U.S. at 436. ‘The continued presence’ in the United States of an alien lawfully determined to be removable ‘permits and prolongs a continuing violation of United States law.’ … Sarkisov hasn’t argued that his case is different.

“To be sure, the government has not opposed Sarkisov’s motion for a stay. But that doesn’t mean that Sarkisov is entitled to relief.

“First, the government’s non-opposition can’t relieve Sarkisov of his burden to satisfy the Nken test.

“What’s more, the government may not effectively compel a court to enter equitable relief by failing to oppose a motion that seeks such relief. A stay pending appeal is an extraordinary remedy that lies within the discretion of the court. Equitable remedies such as stays are ‘never awarded as of right.’ Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Thus, a court must decide for itself whether this remedy is warranted, even though the government does not oppose its issuance.

“Accordingly, the motion for a stay of removal is DENIED.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2025-10-06 20:57:50.796169

Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity to end the state’s policy of denying worker’s compensation to undocumented immigrants who are injured while working.

In a press conference held in advance of oral arguments to the Michigan Supreme Court, which will begin on Wednesday, Anna Hill Galendez, a managing attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said the issues in this case involve basic fairness and worker well-being.

“The reality is, many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more cutting corners on health and safety protections and when workers are inevitably injured, workers compensation insurance companies know they can deny wage loss benefits without challenge,” Galendez said.

John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, noted that this issue has already been addressed in Ohio and Minnesota, where in both states undocumented workers have been guaranteed access to worker’s compensation. The Sugar Law Center is representing the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center alongside FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization focused on issues of corporate agriculture.

“Going to work should not mean having to gamble your health, your livelihood or the ability to care for your family,” Galendez added.

However, this case, first filed in 2021 in the Court of Claims, has become about more than just immigrant rights, argued lawyer David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. The Court of Appeals, overturning a decision from the Court of Claims, ruled in May 2024 that the argument was not timely — thus making Whitmer subject to immunity — because the claim was filed more than one year after the governor’s policy went into effect.

“That would mean that when the governor has a policy of any unconstitutional conduct, including this one, the fact that she got away with it for a year would keep anyone from ever going to court,” Muraskin said.

Phil Mayor, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, which has filed an amicus brief in the case, shared a similar portrayal of the issue.

“It’s an issue about whether Michiganders, and I mean all Michiganders, can go to court to stop the government from breaking the law, or whether, as the governor would have it, if they’ve gotten away with breaking the law for a year, they can just keep doing it indefinitely,” Mayor said.

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and its lawyers are aiming to have this case sent back to the Court of Claims by the Supreme Court. Muraskin also noted, however, “she [Gov. Whitmer] could tomorrow choose to stop enforcing this policy and follow the law, and that would resolve this case entirely.”

The flight with the 10 migrants from various locations originated in Louisiana and reached Eswatini earlier Monday, after stops in Puerto Rico, Senegal and Angola, the AP reported, citing officials on the ground and a lawyer for two of the deportees.

The five men deported earlier this year — from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos and Yemen — had various criminal backgrounds and convictions, according to a post from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson at the time.

The Trump administration also recently notified the team of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accidentally deported to El Salvador earlier this year, that immigration authorities were seeking to deport him to Eswatini, according to a DHS spokesperson.

Eswatini is a small kingdom of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa where King Mswati III has ruled with absolute power for almost 40 years. Human Rights Watch says it has reviewed documents that show the U.S. will pay Eswatini $5.1 million as part of a deal to take up to 160 deportees.

In his first months back in office, President Trump’s administration has talked with various countries about taking U.S. deportees, with the administration saying last week it would offer to pay migrant children for self-deportation.

The administration has also enacted an aggressive effort to identify, arrest and deport migrants without legal status in cities across the country, spurring protests outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices.

The Trump administration, in turn, has moved to deploy National Guard troops to some cities, which it says is necessary to protect ICE agents and buildings.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called these protests “domestic terrorism” in a Sunday post on the social platform X.

When reached for comment on the Eswatini deportations, DHS pointed The Hill to the White House.

“The illegal aliens deported to Eswatini have been convicted of heinous crimes which include murder and rape – they do not belong in the United States,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to The Hill on Monday.

“The Trump Administration is fulfilling the President’s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens using all the tools at our disposal.”

JB Pritzker called an “invasion.”

Trump pushed forward with the plan to activate hundreds of National Guard soldiers, including some from Texas, despite monthslong opposition from state and local leaders, as well as objections from civic and business groups in the city.

“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” Pritzker said in a statement Sunday night. “It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy troops to Illinois to protect federal immigration officers and facilities. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview, a near-west suburb of Chicago, has been the site of several clashes between ICE agents and demonstrators in recent weeks.

But Pritzker, who said Saturday that he refused the Trump administration’s “ultimatum” to activate the National Guard himself, has insisted there is no emergency necessitating guardsmen on the ground. He also warned that White House officials would use any conflict between immigration agents and civilians as a “pretext” for military occupation.

“It will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police,” the lawsuit said.

The suit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois, names Trump, Noem and Hegseth as defendants.

Texas National Guard also activated

Illinois filed its lawsuit hours after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced he will send 400 guardsmen to cities around the country, including Chicago, and after a federal judge in Oregon blocked National Guard deployments to Portland.

The order is “effective immediately for an initial period of 60 days” and subject to extension, according to the memo, signed by Hegseth. It comes a day after Pritzker confirmed Trump’s intention to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the lawsuit reads. “To guard against this, foundational principles of American law limit the president’s authority to involve the military in domestic affairs. Those bedrock principles are in peril.”

The promised deployment comes as ICE has ramped up activity in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.

There have also been two shootings since the clashes began. On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a “manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.

Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants who have criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens and children with zip ties. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.

The lawsuit also alleges ICE activity in Chicago and its suburbs has already subjected Illinois “to serious and irreparable harm.”

“It also creates economic harm, depressing business activities and tourism that not only hurt Illinoisians but also hurt Illinois’s tax revenue,” the complaint said.

That argument echoes one made by a group of Chicago business and civic groups over the weekend.

“National Guard troops on our streets, like those reportedly being ordered here by the federal government, have the potential to sow fear and chaos, threatening our businesses’ bottom lines and our reputation,” the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago and the Civic Federation said in a joint statement Saturday.

Read the lawsuit here.

Order violates states’ rights

Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the troop deployment violates Illinois’ rights as sovereign state to carry about its own law enforcement, as well as 1878 Posee Comitatus Act that bans the military from participating in domestic law enforcement.

The lawsuit also claims the Trump administration failed to meet any criteria that could allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The president can federalize the National Guard to stop a foreign invasion, when the president can’t execute the laws of the country or to stop a rebellion.

Raoul and state leaders have argued for weeks that Trump would use protests in Broadview as a “flimsy pretext” to claim a rebellion.

Several protestors have been arrested near the facility in recent weeks on charges of assaulting officers. Federal agents have sprayed tear gas and fired nonlethal ammunition into crowds that have gathered there.

Over the weekend, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman on the city’s Southwest Side in a confrontation with protesters. Prosecutors eventually charged the woman and another protestor with attempting to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.” According to the Chicago Sun-Times, agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment before she was charged.

Further, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration has entirely manufactured any public safety crisis in Illinois that would require military intervention. It cites a 2013 social media post by Trump, two years before he announced his candidacy for president, that suggested the military should be deployed to Chicago. It lists several other derogatory comments Trump made about the city, state and their leaders over the years, including as president.

Read more: As Trump declares ‘we’re going in,’ Pritzker says ‘terror and cruelty is the point’

The lawsuit argues that animosity culminated last week with Trump claiming during a speech to military generals that there was an “invasion from within” and suggesting cities like Chicago should be used as “training grounds” for the military.

How soldiers will be deployed

The lawsuit includes new details about how federal officials communicated with state leaders and gave Pritzker an ultimatum.

DHS sent a memo to the Illinois National Guard on Sept. 28 stating troops “would integrate with federal law enforcement operations, serving in direct support of federal facility protection, access control, and crowd control.”

On Saturday morning, Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Rodney Boyd received a formal email from the Defense Department National Guard Bureau saying Trump asked for at least 300 soldiers, and if Boyd did not activate them within two hours, Hegseth would federalize them. Boyd responded that Pritzker declined to activate the guard. Defense officials sent a new memo late Saturday saying the guard was federalized.

Illinois National Guard leaders received another memo on Sunday informing them soldiers from Texas would be sent to Chicago beginning Monday.

Abbott, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, has been a frequent foil of Pritzker, bussing thousands of asylum-seeking migrants from the border to Chicago in 2023 and 2024 and criticizing the Illinois governor for welcoming Texas Democratic legislators who fled their state this summer amid a partisan redistricting fight. He said in a social media post that Pritzker “can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let the Texas Guard do it.”

Prior to this year, the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without a request from a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent federal troops to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama without the cooperation of segregationist Gov. George Wallace.

The new figures have not been finalized by the Trump administration or officially transmitted in a notification to Congress as required by last week’s deadline, according to two people familiar with the situation who were granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss it with the media.

The decreased numbers of refugees would be a stark departure from the higher figures traditionally allowed into the U.S. — the Biden administration last year set a target of 125,000 refugee admissions.

And advocates warn it would essentially bump from the line those who have already been vetted and are awaiting approvals. It all comes as the Department of Homeland Security is engaged in a crackdown on immigrants in American cities, including this past weekend in Chicago,and recruiting officers with a social media campaign to “recapture our national identity.”

“This would be a monumental shift in U.S. refugee policy, not just in terms of reducing admissions, but also in terms of disproportionately privileging one group over every other,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and chief executive officer of resettlement organization Global Refuge.

“Our concern is that this could turn what has long been a globally responsive humanitarian system into one that overwhelmingly favors a single group,” Vignarajah said.

Trump suspended the refugee program in January

The refugee program — which once had widespread bipartisan support — was suspended on Trump’s first day in office.

Since then only a trickle of refugees have been admitted to the country, either as part of an ongoing court case seeking to resume the program or as part of a new refugee program for Afrikaners that Trump announced in February. The administration says the white South African farmers face discrimination and violence at home, which the country’s government strongly denies.

The White House said the refugee cap is not final until the administration consults with Congress, according to an official granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss the situation.

The official and one of the other people said due to the federal government shutdown, no refugees will be admitted during the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, until the government is reopened, although with the program suspended, few are being let in as is.

Some 128,000 refugees have currently been approved for resettlement in the United States and are now stuck in limbo, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency. In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.

“How can a president who claims to stand for religious and American values and who claims to support legal and orderly migration turn his back on so many refugees who followed the rules, while moving white South Africans to the front of the line?” he said.

The expected admissions are lower than advocates hoped

The 7,500 number is a dramatic reduction in the already historically low refugee admission caps that Trump put forward during his first term and also well below what refugee advocates had feared would be the target for the coming fiscal year.

In early- to mid-September, organizations that assist refugees began sounding the alarm that the administration was considering a cap of roughly 30,000, with most of those spots reserved for white South Africans.

Administration officials said at the time that the numbers were in flux and would require White House sign off, but gave no indication that the total number could be slashed by more than 20,000 from what the advocates had feared.

As the government shutdown loomed last week, these officials began to say that no final determination would be made until Congress had been consulted and that that was unlikely until after the shutdown ended.

One senior U.S. official said Saturday such consultation is still required and would not likely occur until the government goes back to work.

But the official also noted that 7,500 admissions in the current fiscal year would be “significantly more” than had been allowed in since Trump took office for the second time in January.

Other refugees may be left in limbo

Certain lawmakers in Congress have been pressing the White House for the official notification, which was required by law by the Sept. 30 deadline.

The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees that handle immigration matters said the Trump administration is “in open defiance of the law.”

Refugees are being left in “limbo,” wrote Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and other top Democrats on the Judiciary panels in a letter last week. “The consequences are dire.”

They said thousands of people are facing persecution abroad “who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements” are being left to languish in refugee while Trump is “carving out exceptions for white South African farmers, allowing Afrikaners to skip the line.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/border-migrants-15.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:57:55.142892

“What happens when this ramp-up occurs and we have so much more funding going toward immigration detention that it becomes harder to roll back?” This inertia can be seen in the sheer number of immigration detention centers being built—or in some cases, repurposed.","An Indigenous nation of fewer than 1,000 people in South Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe doesn’t often get involved in local politics. But then private contractors showed up to an abandoned airport and started erecting a detention center in the middle of the Everglades. The Miccosukee leapt into action, realizing that the behemoth structure would drastically change the fragile wetlands that they call home.

It didn’t take long for the so-called Alligator Alcatraz to also develop a reputation for egregious human rights abuses. Billed as an immigration detention center for the “most dangerous criminals,” reports started quickly circulating that detainees were experiencing medical neglect and didn’t have access to basic hygiene. More than thirty men were detained in a single cage, with only three toilets to share. Immigration lawyers reported that they could not communicate with their clients, with some detainees even disappearing within the system.

“We found out that Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity were putting together a lawsuit,” says Curtis Esteban Osceola, an attorney and senior policy adviser to the chair of the Miccosukee Tribe. The tribe joined this environmentally focused suit a few weeks later.

While the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had organized a lawsuit that outlined civil rights abuses at Alligator Alcatraz, the environmental lawsuit focused on the ecological impact of the detention center. The groups pointed out that the private contractors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hired to build the facility had started construction without the necessary environmental reviews mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and could jeopardize already endangered species. When the Miccosukee Tribe joined, they added that the barbed wire fences around the facility cut them off from ancient burial grounds, and that the construction had gone ahead without consultation with tribal leaders.

Faced with this evidence, U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams issued a temporary restraining order and then a ruling, which halted construction on the facility, including an immediate shutdown of the sewage and waste management system, which was deemed unfit for use.

“It effectively shuts the facility down because without sewage management and waste receptacles, the facility can’t operate,” Osceola explains.

Since then, Alligator Alcatraz has been steadily dismantled, marking a major blow to one of the Trump Administration’s most hostile experiments in immigration detention. However, Trump’s assault on immigrant communities has continued with an unprecedented number of ICE raids sweeping cities across the nation, forcing families to stay home out of fear of being picked up and becoming a part of the record number of 61,226 people currently in immigration detention across the country.

“People aren’t going to doctors’ appointments,” says Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “When immigration raids happen, they aren’t sending their kids to school.”

Already, communities like the heavily immigrant-populated Boyle Heights in Los Angeles are experiencing the economic fallout of Trump’s raids as shoppers stay home and street vendors and other local businesses lose customers. Even the Las Vegas Strip has experienced a downturn as hospitality workers stay home, citing fears of similar raids.

If Alligator Alcatraz is any indication, local communities and interest groups can come together to challenge Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, bringing together environmental, economic, and local interests to chip away at his deportation machine.

“Local advocates have spent a lot of time preparing for the second Trump Administration, even before he took office,” Bush-Joseph says. In some cases, she explains, this means understanding decision-making hierarchies in local politics and forging relationships with key decision-makers, such as sheriffs and local politicians.

One of the ways that this federal crackdown is being carried out on a local level is through 287(g) agreements, which enable ICE to train and deputize local police forces to carry out immigration enforcement. While these agreements have technically been around since the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has capitalized on them as a means to supercharge immigration enforcement, pressuring jurisdictions across the country to enter into them. Under Trump, the number of these agreements has ballooned from just 135 at the beginning of 2025 to almost 900 by mid-August, with states like Florida and Texas leading the nation in approving such partnerships.

“In the past, these agreements have meant that there are fewer resources for local public safety efforts and that communities will be afraid of reporting crimes to the police,” Bush-Joseph says, citing a 2018 study from the libertarian Cato Institute that found these agreements had no impact on crime statistics. Conversely, they might hinder local law enforcement’s ability to fight crime.

“Opportunity costs might be one of the most important,” Bush-Joseph continues, explaining that along with eroding trust with immigrant communities, a lot of time will be spent on immigration enforcement when it could be spent on other law enforcement needs.

While there are three kinds of 287(g) agreements, the most prominent is the Task Force Model, which enables local police officers to inquire about someone’s immigration status and call ICE during routine enforcement duties.

Since the passage of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July—which earmarks more than $170 billion for immigration and border control—and the DHS announcement in August of generous signing bonuses for new ICE recruits, a number of sheriffs have spoken out against these agreements, accusing immigration enforcement of betraying partnerships and now poaching their best officers.

Given that these agreements are made on a local level, community members are able to push back at town hall meetings and with local decision-makers—including sheriffs and city council members. While the Trump Administration has made an aggressive push for counties to adopt these agreements, some communities have successfully stopped them from going forward. In Maine, the town of Wells paused its agreement with ICE while the state considers legislation to ban these kinds of contracts. Camden’s police department in Delaware rescinded its agreement with ICE after backlash from residents. Even in Florida’s Key West, residents were able to suspend the program, although it was recently reinstated following pressure from the state attorney general.

“There are so many resources being poured into immigration that we have to ask about inertia,” Bush-Joseph says. “What happens when this ramp-up occurs and we have so much more funding going toward immigration detention that it becomes harder to roll back?”

This inertia can be seen in the sheer number of immigration detention centers being built—or in some cases, repurposed. When Alligator Alcatraz became a legal target, Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis turned his attention to another shuttered facility with plans to reopen as an immigrant detention center outside of Jacksonville, a former state prison now dubbed “Deportation Depot.” An Indiana state complex near the venue for the Indianapolis 500 has been nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer” as it prepares to allocate one-third of its beds to immigrant detainees. A similar facility in Nebraska has been named the “Cornhusker Clink.” Most recently, the Trump Administration opened a tent camp for immigrant detainees at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, which Trump hopes will someday be the largest immigration detention center in the country.

Some cities—such as Elizabeth, New Jersey—have successfully resisted ICE building prisons in their neighborhoods.

“You have to organize with people,” says Nedia Morsy, the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, who helped mobilize a local push to keep Elizabeth’s Union County Jail from contracting with ICE and other private prisons.

“It’s not like county officials came to us and told us that they were thinking about [contracting with ICE],” she laughs. “We found out because we have a strong base that feels confident in our leadership and shared what they heard swirling around the city.”

By the time Morsy and her team were able to confirm the rumors, the vote to put up a bid for the jail was happening within the next ninety-six hours. Still, the community was able to organize a mass mobilization of more than 200 people that turned out to protest the vote, with thirty people offering testimony at the meeting.

Even then, the vote passed, which allowed the county to advance to the next stage and put the jail up for auction. Instead of backing down, Morsy and her team continued mobilizing to keep the pressure on by organizing meetings and op-eds in the local newspapers, coupled with calls to the county commissioner’s office. “We had an election coming up, so we wanted to make a connection about how important the jail was to the voters,” she says, explaining that the jail is right in the middle of Elizabeth’s downtown. “We also wrote up a legal memo to explain to the county how it was totally feasible for them to edit their bid so that ICE or a federal prison could not be considered.”

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence was the ongoing abuses of detainees being documented at Delaney Hall, another federal immigration detention facility in nearby Newark. During a Congressional visit to Delaney Hall in May, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing. While the charges were eventually dropped, the arrest showed just how brazen ICE could be.

“We leveraged this moment to draw attention to the fact that there are no rules or regulations when it comes to working with ICE,” Morsy explains. The outrage generated support for the mayor and solidarity across the city.

Many local officials started to testify alongside other community members at the monthly meetings, and the tide started to turn. By the time of the next vote, there was broad support for refusing to contract with ICE or any other private prison.

For anyone trying to organize against ICE building or repurposing an existing prison as an immigration detention center, Morsy recommends becoming very clear about the objective.

“Our goal is not just to shut down the Union County Jail or shut down detentions,” she explains. “Our goal is to make it untenable for ICE detentions and ICE jails and ICE camps to operate here.”

That requires understanding the various ways different community members can participate.

“Everybody has a role to play, right?” she says. Some of the more affluent members of the community, for example, have personal relationships with the commissioner.

“For the working class, we have to recognize the power of our testimonies and think about the ways that local communities are impacted by these decisions,” she continues. “We need to get these people in a room with elected officials.”

If there is a structure being built, “you have to look at the land that you’re on,” Osceola suggests, explaining that depending on where you are, there might be different state, federal, or environmental laws that can help make the case. In the case of Alligator Alcatraz, contractors started constructing fences without permits in a fragile ecosystem with no review of the environmental impact.

“Everything was on the record,” he says, noting that these violations were what ultimately swayed the judge in their favor. “The state didn’t do anything. The feds didn’t do anything. They just decided that they were going to build a detention center in the middle of this fragile ecosystem.”

Meanwhile, Morsy recommends keeping an eye on buildings that could be repurposed.

“If you know of any abandoned buildings, you should contact your local elected officials to understand what is happening with them,” she adds. “I can guarantee you that the administration is looking at buildings that can easily be converted into a jail.”",https://progressive.org/downloads/22175/download/EvergladesICEResistance.jpg?cb=9121dcfa4ef8763c841bee4fc187b21f&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 16:58:52.107138

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974.
Since his first successful run for president in 2016, Trump has accused the Justice Department of being infested with “radical left” bureaucrats bent on his destruction.
The White House has seized control of the Justice Department in a way that has not happened in 50 years — and has used it to target Trump’s list of perceived adversaries.
“Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,” Trump said in a speech at the Justice Department in March.","Violating court orders, gutting anti-corruption efforts, imperiling national security and weaponizing law enforcement against the president’s perceived enemies. These are the ways in which Donald Trump and his appointees are destroying the Justice Department, say scores of career employees who were recently pushed out of the DOJ under the president’s second term.

“We believe it’s our duty to sound the alarm about this administration’s degradation of DoJ’s vital work, and its assault on the public servants who do it,” according to an open letter signed by 282 former officials, obtained exclusively by MSNBC.

The collective letter, which was signed by a cross section of former prosecutors, FBI agents, intelligence analysts, immigration judges, civil rights attorneys and others, represents an extraordinary effort by civil servants to publicly call out what they see as Trump’s brazen disregard for constitutional norms and avowed threats of judicial vengeance against those who have crossed him.

All were nonpartisan career officials, not political appointees. Some were fired because they investigated Trump or those who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, violence at the Capitol, while others quietly resigned.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974.

“We call on all Americans — whose safety, prosperity, and rights depend on a strong DOJ – to speak out against its destruction,” they wrote.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974. The Watergate scandal touched the Justice Department, but the recently departed bureaucrats allege Trump has mounted a much broader and more sustained assault on its independence, policies and personnel.

“This administration’s lies about the ‘deep state’ and exaggerations about government inefficiency have eroded the respect our country once held for public servants,” the letter says. “Demonizing, firing, demoting, involuntarily transferring, and directing employees to violate their ethical duties has already caused an exodus of over 5,000 of us — draining the Department of priceless institutional knowledge and expertise, and impairing its historical success in recruiting top talent.”

The former officials, echoing sentiments expressed privately to MSNBC by other former and current Trump administration officials who have not been willing to go public, added, “We may feel the effects of this for generations.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since his first successful run for president in 2016, Trump has accused the Justice Department of being infested with “radical left” bureaucrats bent on his destruction. His move to fire FBI Director James Comey and pressure the attorneys general in his first administration became part of a special counsel investigation into whether he obstructed justice, though former special counsel Robert Mueller did not reach a conclusion.

Yet, during Trump’s first term, much of the DOJ ran as it always had. Many of the letter’s signatories worked in the department during that time, and most career officials have said they were free to do their jobs as they saw fit.

The second Trump term has been strikingly different. The White House has seized control of the Justice Department in a way that has not happened in 50 years — and has used it to target Trump’s list of perceived adversaries.

“For decades, the guiding tenet for those working at the department was to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department lawyer and founder of the advocacy group Justice Connection. “Many believe that’s no longer possible. They’re being asked to put loyalty to the President over the Constitution, the rule of law, and their professional ethical obligations.”

The letter will be posted later Monday on the website of Justice Connection.

The president and his supporters say they are merely fulfilling his campaign promises and correcting a historic wrong by shutting down what they call partisan lawfare. The best evidence of that, they say, are two federal felony cases against Trump brought by former special counsel Jack Smith with the help of career FBI agents and prosecutors.

But eight months into his second term — with access to all the texts, emails and phone records preserved from the previous administration — they have yet to produce proof that Biden political appointees influenced those investigations.

“Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,” Trump said in a speech at the Justice Department in March. “So now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.”

The letter says he has done the opposite. It notes that the Justice Department’s basic mission is “to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights.”

Now, the former officials say, “It’s failing on all three fronts.” They point to what they see as the president’s retaliatory prosecutions of Comey, Smith and others; and accuse the Trump Justice Department of violating court orders, evading due process requirements, directing attorneys to eschew their ethical responsibilities and firing employees without notice or cause.

The letter also says Trump and his attorney general, Pam Bondi, have ousted FBI employees, prosecutors, national security experts and shifted highly trained personnel away from counterintelligence and counterterrorism.

The department also has purged attorneys who enforce environmental laws, driven out 75% of attorneys from the Civil Rights Division; and gutted the teams of prosecutors and FBI agents who investigate public corruption, paving the way for government graft, the letter notes.

“The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other longstanding work the Department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,” the letter adds. “Its plans to eliminate the Tax Division, which saves the country billions of dollars by pursuing tax evaders, will leave us poorer. Cancelling hundreds of millions of dollars in grants has left at-risk communities less protected and crime victims less supported.

All of this, the signers say, is “catastrophic for the nation.”

“We call on Congress to exercise its oversight responsibilities far more vigorously,” the letter says. “Members in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle must provide a meaningful check on the abuses we’re witnessing.”

“Our democracy is only as strong as the rule of law, and the rule of law can’t survive without the principal institution that enforces it.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-donald-trump-pam-bondi-ac-730p-61c925.jpg",N,,2025-10-06 19:57:19.423170

In a 27-page decision issued Sept. 19 and reviewed by Charlottesville Tomorrow, U.S. District Court Judge Leonic Brinkema tore apart the DHS case for detaining Ahmed.
“[Ahmed] prevailed before the [immigration court judge],” the ruling reads.
Ahmed, an asylum seeker residing in Charlottesville, was held in the detention center despite being granted bond by an immigration court judge.","Inside the living quarters at the Immigration Centers of America facility in Farmville, Ahmed felt his mental health begin to unravel.

There was little to do and nowhere to be alone. He shared one open room with dozens of other men. They slept in rows of bunks in one half of the room and ate at dining tables that butted up against a row of fully exposed toilets in the other — close enough that the sight and smell of them were part of every meal.

Outdoor recreation was rare. Long days stretched out before him, followed by even longer nights, filled with the quiet sounds of men sobbing.

“I mentally broke,” Ahmed said.

Ahmed is not his real name. He is an asylum seeker currently living in Charlottesville, who spoke with Charlottesville Tomorrow over a Zoom call with his attorney, and asked to not use his real name for his safety.

“I didn’t have any idea how to live in the jail, I didn’t know how to handle this circumstance,” Ahmed said.

That despair deepened when, like a growing number of immigrants detained recently in the United States, Ahmed was granted bond by an immigration court judge, meaning the judge granted his release until his court date. But the Department of Homeland Security refused to release him.

The decision stunned Ahmed and his attorney.

“The Department of Homeland Security filed what’s called an auto stay provision,” said Elizabeth Schmelzel, Ahmed’s attorney through the Legal Aid Justice Center. “This is authority that they have from a regulation just after Sept. 11, which allows them to refuse to release someone from immigration detention, even when they have been granted bond.”

DHS did not respond to Charlottesville Tomorrow’s request for comment.

The regulation she referred to is 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2), which says that DHS can “stay… any order of the immigration judge authorizing release” while the agency appeals the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative body for federal immigration laws.

“I have seen it used once in my career,” Schmelzel said. “It is usually used when the department has a very serious security concern. It is now being used blanketly.”

Across the country, immigration attorneys report that DHS is blocking bond releases more often than ever using this broad regulation, which does not require DHS to give a reason for keeping a person in detention. An Aug. 30 report in The Guardian highlighted several cases where immigrants won bond but were still kept in detention. An anonymous DHS official told the news outlet that government lawyers were instructed to put all bond rulings on hold — though DHS publicly denied that claim.

Faced with this incredible circumstance, immigrants and their attorneys are turning to the federal court system. There they file petitions of habeas corpus, a procedure that lets a judge decide whether someone’s detention is lawful. Filing this kind of petition is a drastic step, one that essentially argues that the government is holding someone illegally — in violation of its own Constitution.

And federal court judges are approving these petitions at a striking rate, according to Schmelzel and other immigration attorneys who have spoken publicly.

This was the case with Ahmed.

In a 27-page decision issued Sept. 19 and reviewed by Charlottesville Tomorrow, U.S. District Court Judge Leonic Brinkema tore apart the DHS case for detaining Ahmed.

“[Ahmed] prevailed before the [immigration court judge],” the ruling reads. But under the current rules, government attorneys can still step in and block the judge’s decision on their own. The court blasted this as “patently unfair,” noting that it hands power to prosecutors who already lost their argument in front of a judge.

“The automatic stay imposed in immigration cases constitutes an unequivocal violation of due process. It is, in effect, no process at all,” Brinkema wrote.

Ahmed was released from the Farmville detention center that very day.

“My release is maybe a miracle,” Ahmed said, with a small smile. But the damage, he added, had already been done.

“I’m mentally still in detention,” he said, shifting uneasily as he spoke. “I can’t go out. If I go outside and see people — or police — I feel like they’re coming to arrest me.”

This was not the first time Ahmed has lived in fear, he said.

Ahmed is one of hundreds of thousands of people who seek asylum in the U.S. each year, saying they would face persecution if forced to return home: prison, torture, even death.

He shared with Charlottesville Tomorrow the story of his long journey and what brought him here. Many of the details could not be independently verified, a common challenge in reporting on people fleeing conflict, persecution or unstable governments. What follows is his personal account.

Violence forced Ahmed to flee his home country

Ahmed’s path to the U.S. began with a seemingly small decision. But one that he said set him apart in his home country of Bangladesh.

He wanted to be an artist.

“In my country, some people believe that drawing pictures is a religious sin,” Ahmed said, speaking through an interpreter. “For that reason, since I was a child, I have faced many problems from fundamentalists and extremists.”

He recalls one day, when he was in the seventh grade at an Islamic Study Center, he sketched a human figure on the blackboard.

“Seeing that, the instructor beat me with a long stick,” Ahmed said. “And once the stick was broken, he beat me with his hands and legs. These types of fundamentalists exist in our country.”

But Ahmed wanted to be an artist. And despite resistance from some in his community who he said believed his art was anti-Islamic, he became one. He earned a master’s degree in India, returned to Bangladesh, and soon was selling art and exhibiting in museums across Europe and Asia.

But his artwork made him a target, he said. And, in 2022, Ahmed displayed some artwork near his neighborhood. Soon after, a group of masked individuals surrounded him in the street and beat him. Badly.

“People in my area knew I was doing this kind of work — that I draw pictures and make sculptures,” he said. “That’s why they attacked me.”

By 2024, the situation had worsened.

That summer, the government re-instated a quota system for civil service jobs, which reserved about one-third of all government jobs for family members of people who had fought in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan, Reuters reported. Students in the country protested, saying the quota favored the political party that was in power, the Awami League. Those protests exploded into a nationwide movement.

Authorities responded with force, imposing curfews, deploying security forces to universities, and cutting internet access as street clashes intensified. Weeks of violent clashes left more than 1,000 people dead. By Aug. 5, 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had resigned and fled the country.

Since her ouster, the activities of her political party, the Awami League, have been banned by Bangladesh’s interim government and the party is being investigated for various abuses of power, according to reporting from DW, an international news network based in Germany.

Critics accuse the Awami League of steadily dismantling democratic checks in Bangladesh. Elections were boycotted or tightly controlled. Opposition figures were jailed. Laws limited what people could say online. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has said that Hasina’s government, along with some Awami League members, committed serious human rights violations. (You can read more from the U.N. and reporting from Reuters.)

But supporters say that same iron grip kept fundamentalist groups at bay. The party took a secular stance and cracked down on Islamist movements. To many Bangladeshis, the Awami League was both a threat to democratic freedoms — and the force keeping extremists from gaining power.

A few days after Hasina’s government fell, a group of men approached him on the street preparing to attack him, Ahmed said. This time, he ran.

“I ran far,” Ahmed said. “Like, 13 kilometers.”

While he was running, some of his attackers went to his family’s home looking for him. Others began sending him threatening text messages, he said.

So Ahmed fled.

“It’s not just me in Bangladesh — lots of actors, artists, writers, models have been forced to flee the country,” he said. “And you will see the houses of many singers and painters have been burned down.”

News outlets, including The Daily Star, the largest English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, are reporting stories of widespread destruction of art, particularly sculptures, in Bangladesh. But groups are also targeting singers and other artists, according to France 24, a Paris-based international news network.

‘I had no option to return back to anywhere’

Ahmed managed to get a Visa to Mexico, his attorney said.

But Mexico did not offer him the safety he sought. The day he arrived in the winter of 2024, he was violently mugged, he said.

He soon connected with a small community of Indian immigrants who told him that people of Indian or Pakistani descent were often targeted, and as a single man alone he was especially vulnerable to being kidnapped for extortion.

So, Ahmed began looking for a way to get to the United States.

His first attempt to simply approach a main border checkpoint on foot failed.

“I tried to talk to a U.S. border guard who could tell me whether I would be allowed to enter because I am going through these circumstances,” he said.

Video of the Immigration Centers of America facility in Farmville recorded in December 2019. Ahmed, an asylum seeker residing in Charlottesville, was held in the detention center despite being granted bond by an immigration court judge. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement

But people on the Mexican side of the gate prevented him from reaching a guard. So, Ahmed said he hired a taxi to drive him back to that same gate.

Instead, that taxi driver took him to a group of smugglers.

Ahmed didn’t know who these people were, but he said they took his money, all his possessions — including his few remaining paintings — and his passport.

The men then dropped him at the border.

“I had no option to return back to anywhere,” he said.

So he said that he simply waited for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to find him.

Once arrested and in ICE custody, Ahmed asked for asylum. It took DHS two days to process Ahmed’s request, set a date for him to appear for his asylum petition and release him on his own recognizance.

Ahmed said he had a friend who lived in Charlottesville, so in January 2025 he made his way here.

A routine ICE check-in resulted in Ahmed’s detention

For the next few months, Ahmed felt himself begin to relax. He made some friends who were studying at the University of Virginia and started looking for local artists to connect with.

“Every weekend, I visited a different type of art gallery to search for some artists. But I just saw some paintings, never the artists. My bad luck,” he said, with a chuckle.

Still, life was finally somewhat stable.

But this peace wouldn’t last.

At his first mandatory ICE check-in in July in Richmond, an official told him he must wear an ankle monitor. They placed it on his left leg, which has some nerve damage, he said. The device, which is large and frequently hot, caused excruciating pain.

He returned to his next ICE check-in with a doctor’s note in hand and asked that it be removed. The official he met with this time would not remove the monitor, but offered to put it on his other leg.

This is where Ahmed’s account diverges from what DHS presented in court.

According to DHS’ court filings, Ahmed “was unwilling to cooperate” and “it was determined that he would remain in custody pending his immigration proceedings.”

Ahmed said he had agreed to ICE’s offer, and while he was waiting for the official to move the monitor to his right leg, three ICE officers entered his room and forcefully arrested him.

“I was not trying to resist them or force them to do anything,” Ahmed said. “I was just asking that they install the ankle monitor on my right leg and let me go. But [the officer] tells me, ‘Your time is up. We gave you a chance and you did not take it.'”

From there, they took Ahmed to a waiting car and shoved him inside, he said.

At the detention center in Farmville, Ahmed’s mental health declined. He found himself experiencing symptoms of intense anxiety and depression. He asked to speak to a mental health counselor. Instead, he said he was sent to a man who instructed him to strategize for what to do once he was deported.

To cope, Ahmed returned to his one true passion in life: art.

He began drawing portraits of his fellow detainees.

“I probably did 100 portraits in two months,” he said. “Every day, I did one, two, three, four portraits.”

The other detainees were thrilled with the gifts, and gave him candies and snacks from the detention center’s commissary.

It’s the only artwork he’s really done since fleeing Bangladesh.

“I had just started my international career,” Ahmed said. “I want to try to build up my career internationally. But, right now, everything is stopped.”

Ahmed is still waiting for the U.S. Immigration Court to hear his asylum case, which is a long and complex legal proceeding.

“When I met [Ahmed], he wasn’t detained, so we were just kind of moving through his trial preparation,” Schmelzel, his attorney, said. “I handle a lot of cases, and my concern now is, because of so many changes in policy, any of my clients could be detained. And if that happens, we will have to stop and do the same thing.”

It took Schmelzel, her team at Legal Aid Justice Center and attorneys from the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights two months of writing motions, petitions and attending court hearings to secure Ahmed’s release.

That’s time she would have liked to have spent preparing for the asylum trial, she said.

“We decided to authorize this body, the Department of Homeland Security, to be prosecutor, jailer and judge with that regulation,” Schmelzel said. “Think about what that really means. It is pretty shocking that the department can just ignore a judge’s order.”",https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-3.24.57-PM-scaled.png,N,,2025-10-06 17:58:00.368292

“This is the most intense litigation against the president in recent history,” Ashraf Ahmed, an associate professor at Columbia Law School, told Spectrum News

The Supreme Court is expected to be the final word on many of the lawsuits. It's already allowing White House actions to stand while cases wind through the system.

Among them:

DOGE

The U.S. DOGE Service is the unofficial federal department that unilaterally got rid of more than a quarter of a million federal workers. According to reports, two labor unions are still fighting the Department of Government Efficiency’s ability to receive data from the Social Security Administration.

The court sided with Trump, allowing DOGE access while the case continues.

Advantage: Trump, for now

Birthright citizenship

Constitutional scholars have long argued the 14th Amendment finds those born on U.S. soil are citizens. That is, until the president signed an executive order saying it should not apply to the children of undocumented immigrants.

The Supreme Court still hasn't decided, but it did stop lower courts from issuing a nationwide injunction.

What does that mean? Across the U.S., a lack of clarity.

“What would be my guess, all things considered, will happen? Birthright citizenship will be preserved, but it's going to happen in a much more piecemeal, step-by-step litigation process,” Ahmed said.

Advantage: Unclear

Tariffs

The president has slapped tariffs on scores of countries, calling it a national emergency. But he did it unilaterally, violating the Constitution, a federal appeals court found in August.

The 7-4 decision concluded “the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution.” But it allowed tariffs to remain, at least for now.

If it rules, the Supreme Court would tackle two issues, Ahmed predicted.

“We've had trade deficits for decades. How can it now be a national emergency?” he said. “So that would be one claim.

“And the second would be Congress would never delegate this type of power.”

Advantage: Unclear

Free speech

The Trump administration marked at least two immigrants for deportation for their pro-Palestinian advocacy. It's a test of whether the First Amendment trumps a once-obscure federal law that allows the secretary of state to deport immigrants found to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

In a twist, a group of university professors is also suing, claiming that by silencing protesters, the White House denied their First Amendment rights as an audience.

“Now, this might strike some listeners as bizarre who are not familiar with First Amendment law, but this has been on books for decades, which is to say that the First Amendment not only protects our rights as speakers, but in many instances protects our rights as listeners, part of a public sphere, to hear controversial ideas, to be part of public discourse,” Ahmed said.

In late September, a federal judge found citizens and noncitizens have the same free speech rights. But observers say it's, again, unclear how the Supreme Court may rule.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Tariffs_AP_25198293238565_NAT_0723,N,,2025-10-06 15:57:11.841396

Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania.","GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to produce evidence within 48 hours on its efforts to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the southern African country of Eswatini.

That evidence from the Trump administration is due by Wednesday to Maryland District Court Judge Paula Xinis. She will consider an order to release Abrego Garcia as part of his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention at a U.S.immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

If the Trump administration is making no effort to remove Abrego Garcia, Xinis said the issue then becomes indefinite detainment of an individual, which runs against a Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants can’t be detained longer than six months if they are not in the process of being removed.

Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported to his home country and to a notorious mega-prison before returning him to the United States to face criminal charges, has thrown the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown into the spotlight.

Xinis, nominated by former President Joe Biden, scheduled another hearing Friday, which will be about Abrego Garcia’s possible removal to Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. The African country has aided the Trump administration in accepting third-country removals.

Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn during Monday’s hearing confirmed such a removal is planned at some point by the administration.

Xinis pressed DOJ attorneys on exactly what steps the federal government has taken to send Abrego Garcia to Eswatini.

Guynn said the federal government has not formally started a plan of removal, but said he could not confirm if removal plans were in motion. He argued that there are no imminent plans by the federal government to remove Abrego Garcia and the DOJ is trying to show that by keeping him in ICE custody.

“The government feels like it's in the damned if it does, damned if it doesn't, situation,” Guynn said. “The government has been trying to respond … about concerns that Mr. Abrego Garcia will be rapidly removed from the United States, notwithstanding his habeas case, and ongoing immigration proceedings, and so in an abundance of caution... the United States is not imminently planning to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia.”

Previously the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia to either Uganda or Eswatini.

DOJ attorneys also asked for a temporary stay in the habeas corpus petition because of the government shutdown.

Xinis denied the stay. She pointed to the DOJ's own shutdown contingency plan, which allows for litigation concerning habeas petitions to continue.

Protests in support of Abrego Garcia

About an hour before Monday’s hearing, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in front of the courthouse to continue its show of support for Abrego Garcia.

About 100 people led chants shouting, “We are Kilmar!” “No More” and “When we fight, we win!” and held signs in support of Abrego Garcia and criticizing the Trump administration.

Religious leaders said prayers and a few other people spoke, such as Krystal Oriadha, who serves as vice chair of the Prince George’s County Council. Oriadha’s father was born in Kenya and immigrated to the U.S., where he met her mother in college.

“I understand the story of immigration, and it’s one that has been such a story of pride in my life because it’s filled of sacrifice, yes and struggles, but pride and love for your family and hard work,” she said. “It is what every immigrant stands for, not the propaganda that this administration is propping up calling hardworking, loving families criminals, demonizing them. So let’s be careful and mindful of the propaganda that they’re spilling today.”

Tennessee charges

The federal judge in Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Tennessee, in which he is accused of human smuggling of immigrants, on Friday granted Abrego Garcia an evidentiary hearing. It will determine if those charges from the Trump administration are an illegal retaliation after Abrego Garcia successfully brought a suit challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador.

Separately, an immigration judge last week denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case.

Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. without legal authorization as a teenager in 2011. He tried to open an asylum case in 2019, but was denied because he did not apply within his first year in the U.S., which is the legal deadline for such claims.

The Friday decision from that immigration judge ends one of the efforts for Abrego Garcia’s lawyers to keep him in the U.S., due to his protections from deportation to El Salvador.

A separate immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia those protections from El Salvador in 2019, finding that Abrego Garcia would likely face violence if returned to his home country.

At the time, the federal government didn’t search for a third country to remove Abrego Garcia.

Six-month limit

Monday’s hearing focused on the time frame of Abrego Garcia’s detainment and whether it conflicted with a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which justices ruled immigrants who are not in the process of removal cannot be kept in ICE detention for more than six months.

Xinis questioned the reason for Abrego Garcia’s detention since late August if the Trump administration had no evidence of its plans to remove the longtime Maryland man.

Another DOJ attorney, Bridget K. O’Hickey, said the federal government has not formalized a removal plan for Abrego Garcia, adding that she didn’t know if there were any plans in the process.

Xinis called a short break in the middle of Monday’s hearing to give the DOJ attorneys time to make any calls to get information if the Trump administration was removing him.

DOJ attorney Ernesto H. Molina said he was unable to reach anyone, pointing to the possible furlough of federal workers.

“It just is remarkable to me that you're saying you can't find a soul who can give you, in this case, any additional information,” Xinis said. “That suggests there is none.”

One of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers in the Maryland case, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, argued that if the Trump administration wanted to remove Abrego Garcia, they would send him to Costa Rica, which has already agreed to accept Abrego Garicia as a refugee.

Xinis asked why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.

“We've received no communications, and I can't even wrap my brain to think of a constitutionally permissible reason why they would be fighting over whether to send them across the Atlantic Ocean when they can, this afternoon, send him to Costa Rica,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Xinis asked the DOJ attorneys if there has been any effort to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, but Molina and O’Hickey said they have not been informed of those efforts.

Human smuggling charges

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia’s criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration was trying to force him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and was ordered released by the federal judge in Tennessee to await his trial there in January on charges he took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States.

In late August, after Abrego Garcia was released from U.S. Marshals Service custody in Tennessee, immigration officials informed him he had to appear in Baltimore before the ICE field office for a check-in appointment. During that appointment, Abrego Garcia was detained.

Xinis has previously ordered the Trump administration cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. while his habeas petition continues, and that he must be kept within 200 miles of the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland. Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania.

CHICAGO — In the wake of aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, some elected officials and union leaders are calling on the community to help protect immigrant students and their families.

Chicago Public Schools is also reminding families that it doesn’t collect immigration information and that parents should provide emergency contact information to schools.

The messages from CPS, the Chicago Teachers Union, and state and local elected representatives came after a mother and her children, ages 8 and 3, were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at Millennium Park last weekend. Their comments also come after federal agents rappelled onto an apartment building in South Shore on Tuesday, where ICE arrested more than 30 people. Many migrant families have settled in the South Side neighborhood in recent years.

Chicago Public Schools did not say whether South Shore-area schools had planned or offered additional support for their students this week after the raid.

During a press conference Thursday outside of Roosevelt High School in the immigrant-rich neighborhood of Albany Park, teachers and elected officials reported ICE activity and arrests in the neighborhood Wednesday, including near schools. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not confirm whether ICE detained anyone near the school or elsewhere in the neighborhood.

“I am standing here with educators, teachers, school clerks, teachers assistants, social workers and nurses to say that again … They are not welcome to pick up parents and detain them after they drop their children off at our schools. They are not welcome in our neighborhoods to terrorize, to ask for papers,” Stacy Davis Gates, president of the CTU, told reporters.

In a Wednesday letter to CPS families, interim CPS CEO Macquline King said teachers do not ask students or families for immigration status, and CPS does not share student records with ICE or other federal representatives without a court order or consent from the student’s guardian. Her letter also reminded families that schools do not allow federal agents inside without a criminal judicial warrant signed by a federal judge.

Evelyn Gonzalez, a teacher and CTU delegate at Roosevelt, said teachers volunteered to stay late at the building Wednesday for kids who felt safer staying back.

“There were businesses offering refuge in case we needed it, and there were neighbors from our community stepping up to make sure our students were safe walking home,” Gonzalez said. “I hope that we can stand together and that we can care for each other.”

Ald. Rossana Rodriguez, whose ward includes Albany Park, said she closed her office early Wednesday so that she and staff could help monitor school dismissal. Her office and community organizers were able to gather 50 people in about two hours who would help “notify the community” in case ICE agents showed up, she said.

State Sen. Graciela Guzman told reporters that the children and mother arrested at Millennium Park have been released, and the 8-year-old girl went to school Thursday, crediting advocacy from the community. A federal judge ordered that both are protected from deportation for now, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“She went to school today and she played in her playground today,” Guzman said.

The White House said in a statement to Fox News Digital that every shutdown comes with consequences.
""The Democrats can reopen the government at any time,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Monday.","This government shutdown isn’t President Donald Trump’s first rodeo navigating a lapse in government funding — but this time, the focus is less on the White House as all eyes are locked on Congress and its budget impasse.

While the 35-day shutdown during Trump’s first term centered around the president's priorities to fund a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the current shutdown doesn’t pit the White House against the legislative branch.

Rather, there is a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over certain healthcare provisions — alleviating pressure on the White House and giving Trump time to post videos showing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a sombrero in an AI-generated clip underscoring Republicans' claims that Democrats want to provide healthcare to illegal immigrants.

Here's What Trump Wants To Do To Reshape The Federal Government During The Shutdown

This paves the way for Trump to remain in the wings during the partial shutdown, and let Democrats take the fall for the consequences, according to libertarian political columnist Kristin Tate.

""By staying relatively quiet right now, President Trump is allowing Democrats to ‘own’ the shutdown,"" Tate said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""The president realizes that if he says anything confrontational right now, the narrative will center around his remarks rather than the Democrats' refusal to support a reasonable spending bill.""

""By maintaining a low profile, Trump is allowing the public to see how the Democrats are acting,"" Tate said. ""The Democrats will ultimately bear most of the political consequences of the shutdown.""

The government entered a partial shutdown Wednesday, amid a stalemate between Senate Republicans and Democrats over a short-term funding bill to keep the government open through Nov. 21. The House had previously passed the temporary spending bill in September.

Three Senate Democrats joined Republicans to vote for the stopgap funding bill Tuesday, but the measure fell short of the required 60 votes needed for passage.

Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have claimed Democrats are seeking to provide health care for illegal immigrants, keeping the government from operating. They cite a provision that would repeal part of Trump’s tax and domestic policy bill — the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" — which scaled back Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens.

But Democrats have said Republicans’ claims are false, and instead, have said they want to permanently extend certain Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to lapse at the end of 2025.

Republicans Erupt Over Shutdown Chaos, Accuse Dems Of Holding Government 'Hostage'

""They say that undocumented people are going to get these credits,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday. ""That is absolutely false. That is one of the big lies that they tell.""

The shutdown differs from the one during Trump’s first term, where Trump and Democrats in Congress sparred about nearly $6 billion in funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall in the spending bill for weeks.

Ultimately, Trump backed off amid mounting pressure to reopen the government so federal employees could resume being paid after weeks of stalled payroll, and signed off on legislation to temporarily reopen the government without the border wall funding.

Matt Wolking, who previously served as the deputy communications director for Trump's 2020 campaign, said that the main difference between this shutdown in comparison to the previous one is that Democrats are the one requesting a policy change — not the White House.

""Trump is as engaged as ever — and using humor effectively, of course — and the biggest difference between now and then is that now it's Democrats who are demanding a specific policy change,"" Wolking said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""They voted against funding the government because they want taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants, and that's why Trump and Republicans are well positioned to win the shutdown messaging battle this time.""

Additionally, Republican strategist Matt Gorman said that Democrats have put themselves in a tough position since they were the ones that voted against the continuing resolution.

""Times have shown over and over through the years that the public supports funding the government. They penalize the party that attaches extra policy priorities to whatever bill does that,"" Gorman, who previously served as the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""You're already seeing moderate Democrats splinter off. As this goes on, I expect that to continue.""

Meanwhile, Trump is taking advantage of the shutdown to advance his priorities to whittle down the federal government in an unprecedented move. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget ordered agencies in September to draw up plans for a reduction-in-force in the event of a lapse in appropriations.

Government Shuts Down After Congress Deadlocks On Spending Deal

While federal employees typically are furloughed during government shutdowns, the Trump administration’s plans would permanently scale back the size of the federal workforce if a government shutdown occurs.

""Republicans must use this opportunity of Democrat forced closure to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud,"" Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday. ""Billions of Dollars can be saved. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Vice President JD Vance has adopted a proactive role carrying the administration’s position, and told reporters Tuesday he predicted the shutdown wouldn’t last long. Specifically, he said that evidence suggests moderate Democrats are ""cracking a little"" because they understand the ""fundamental illogic"" of the shutdown.

Still, he said that layoffs were forthcoming. Trump said Sunday that layoffs were ""taking place right now"" as thousands of workers' jobs remain in jeopardy.

""We're going to have to make things work,"" Vance said. ""And that means that we're going to have to triage some certain things, that means certain people are going to have to get laid off. And we're going to try to make sure that the American people suffer as little as possible from the shutdown.""

The White House said in a statement to Fox News Digital that every shutdown comes with consequences.

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romeo with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

Each day before sunrise, David Huerta checks his rearview mirror for immigration enforcement agents as he drives through the dark to a warehouse in a southwest Chicago suburb. Once he’s clocked in, he peers periodically through the windows on the truck dock, making sure ICE isn’t there. For hours this will go on, as he unloads pallets heavy with sacks of flour and salt, bound for grocery stores nationwide.

When trucks pull into the dock, Huerta readies his forklift to begin unloading the pallets, but first, he must interact with the drivers.

Most are professional while filling out the required paperwork. However, some of the drivers harass him, behavior that has increased since President Trump took office in January.

“The most degrading thing is when the drivers arrive with their MAGA caps and they ask, ‘Hey, when are you going back to Mexico?’ ” said Huerta, who works for a company that makes baking mixes and nutritional powders. “ ‘Soon, don’t worry about it.’ That’s the only answer you give, because you can’t say more, because you don’t know if when you close the door, they’ll make a call and say, ‘Hey, there’s some Mexicans in here.’ ”

Huerta is one of the 68,000 workers in the Chicago region’s food and beverage manufacturing sector, according to a 2023 report from World Business Chicago, an economic development agency. Warehouses operated by some of the nation’s largest food brands accept raw products from farms that are processed and mixed into edible goods, boxed, packaged and shipped to grocery stores and restaurants nationwide.

The labor force of forklift drivers, box packers, mixers and inspectors that has helped turn Chicago into a global logistical hub is largely fueled by immigrants with varying legal statuses.

For decades, those jobs have often been difficult and sometimes unsafe, with undocumented workers having little recourse when their rights were violated. In recent years, worker advocates have said that state and federal policies have made progress in protecting vulnerable immigrants who anchor the region’s growing food logistics industry.

But now, the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies have revived fears that recent gains are unraveling and the stability of the region’s food system will be shaken. Trump has ended deportation deferral programs, increased workplace raids and sued the state of Illinois over some of its labor laws.

Most notably, Trump terminated a Biden-era program called Deferred Action for Labor Enforcement, or DALE, which allowed undocumented workers who spoke out about labor violations to apply for a four-year work permit, essentially removing the threat of deportation.

Huerta was granted a permit through DALE in 2024.

He and dozens of other undocumented temp workers made formal complaints against their employer, a third-party food logistics company with several locations throughout the Chicago area. The workers alleged that management discriminated by giving them heavy or dangerous jobs that the company knew they couldn’t refuse because of their immigration status. As a result, Huerta was granted a temporary work permit and was able to switch jobs.

“It turns out that the mistreatment, the distinction between full-time workers and temp workers is quite significant, because full-time workers are not usually given jobs that are as heavy as those given to agency workers,” Huerta said.

Huerta feels vulnerable, even though he is, for the first time in 26 years, able to work legally in the U.S.

“It’s true that right now, I have my work permit, but it’s the same thing, you’re still undocumented, you’re still the one who has no say,” said Huerta, whose temporary work permit does not provide a path to citizenship.

To better understand how Trump’s immigration policies are reshaping Chicago and its role in the national food system, Investigate Midwest spoke with dozens of warehouse workers, food manufacturers, immigrant advocates, lawmakers and neighborhood leaders.

The increase in workplace raids across the country has made many too afraid to show up for work.

Companies have laid off hundreds of people after Trump revoked some work permit programs. In suburban Schaumburg, more than 500 people were laid off in April from Nestlé USA’s Nation Pizza, the maker of DiGiorno and other popular frozen pizza brands.

The end of DALE underscores a broader shift. Once seen as a tool to encourage workers to come forward about labor violations, its cancellation signals the administration’s possible intent to not investigate workplace violations.

“The climate of uncertainty that has been created here, I think it’s particularly punitive, and it is affecting the food supply chain,” said Nik Theodore, a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois Chicago. “There are wide-ranging impacts here, in very uncertain times.”

Temp work, exploitation and the fight for protections

Even before the first non-Indigenous settlers arrived in the Chicago area, the land between the Upper Mississippi River System and the Great Lakes was a confluence of trade.

Over the past 170 years, the addition of railroads, river ports, major highways and airports has turned Chicago into one of the largest logistics hubs on the continent.

As the region’s manufacturing sector declined in the 1970s, the area leaned into its logistics industry, which became “an economic fix,” according to José Miguel Acosta-Córdova, an economic geographer and historian.

“There was a large area of land available for purchase for development west of the city, and you had eager governments,” Acosta-Córdova said of the collar counties, a five-county region west of Chicago. “There’s the need to move goods efficiently and rapidly around the world, and the need to store those goods as they were moving, right? So then the ’80s and ’90s and onwards, you see this huge logistics boom started happening.”

As massive warehouses were built, thousands of new jobs were created.

Over the last century, America’s agriculture and food production industries — including meatpacking plants, corn fields and industrial animal farms — have increasingly relied on immigrant labor as a way to maintain low pay and substandard working conditions.

With few other options, some of the immigrants who have flocked to jobs at Chicago’s food warehouses told Investigate Midwest they are forced to deal with demanding quotas and unsafe conditions.

“I came to this country with the American dream,” said Ricardo César González-Valentína, a warehouse worker from Mexico City. “But [abuse] begins to take away a piece of your life, of your body. You come here to work, you don’t come to do bad things. When I get to know the warehouses, it’s work that sustains the country, because that’s truly what we do. Contributing our part so that every American, from every country, can be fed. It has to pass through working hands. And those hands are mostly Latinos, from the moment a seed is harvested, from the moment it is planted, it blossoms, and the fruit emerges.”

While roughly 42% of farm workers are undocumented, less is known about how many undocumented people work in food manufacturing because it’s not tracked by a federal agency.

“This is a number that’s kind of difficult to put your finger on,” said Theodore, the UIC professor. “What we do know is that these workers are the backbone of the food system in Illinois and nationwide.”

Even before Trump’s second term, the food supply chain struggled to find enough workers, but in recent months, farms, meatpacking plants and warehouses have reported a rise in labor shortages. The work can be physically demanding and repetitive, and the pay is low. Huerta is paid $18 an hour to drive a forklift all day.

Theodore believes Trump’s mass deportations will worsen the problem.

“Labor markets are not going to just seamlessly adjust without friction,” Theodore said. “I don’t think that there is a waiting workforce that is hoping to be employed by food processing plants. And this applies both to the city of Chicago, the collar counties, the rest of Illinois, and the major food manufacturing belts in Nebraska, in Iowa and elsewhere.”

Many individuals employed in the food distribution and processing industries are hired by temporary staffing agencies that often do not provide a clear pathway to full-time employment. This arrangement creates a “permatemp” workforce that critics say traps people in low-paying and sometimes hazardous jobs for decades.

González-Valentína, the warehouse worker from Mexico City, received a work permit through the DALE program before Trump took office. He described the food logistics company he previously worked for as “a mafia.”

“They fire people every six months. The company won’t let you have seniority because it doesn’t want to give benefits,” he said. “When we were there, they fired people every six months and still had the nerve to hire another 100 people.”

Worker centers in and around Chicago have attempted to advocate for better pay and benefits, increased safety and more job security. But the decks are stacked against temp workers, according to Maria Alfaro, an organizer with Warehouse Workers for Justice.

“If [a higher up] doesn’t like you, they’ll give the harder spots to the people that don’t have status, because they know that they need the job. And if they complain, they can get rid of them,” Alfaro said.

“That’s where people are getting hurt. People are getting hernias. People are getting their hands messed up with rotary tears because of the weight that they have to carry. And some of these people are women, you know, puny women that are carrying 50-pound bags. I don’t know how they do it all day.”

State lawmakers push for worker protections

In recent years, Illinois lawmakers enacted measures enshrining public education rights for children of undocumented parents, approved driver’s licenses for noncitizens, and restricted state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.

Legislators also required employers to notify workers within five business days when federal authorities flag discrepancies in their E-Verify — the voluntary federal system that verifies worker eligibility — or I-9 employment forms. An I-9 audit means that ICE or the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division within ICE may do an on-site investigation of a worksite. A raid is different in that it won’t be announced. The law also prohibits employers from screening job applicants through E-Verify before hiring.

In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of Illinois, arguing that its state law interferes with immigration enforcement. A federal judge in Chicago dismissed that lawsuit in August.

This past legislative session, lawmakers also nearly passed amendments to the Privacy in the Workplace Act, which would have allowed worker centers and workers, regardless of their immigration status, to sue employers for violating their rights. The proposal was a response to the Trump administration’s funding cuts to federal labor enforcement.

Those funding cuts could put more pressure on states to investigate worker violations, but Illinois is facing its own funding challenges.

“The state is in financial straits,” said State Rep. Edgar Gonzalez, a Chicago Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, who said the proposal will be brought back in November. “And we don’t want to impose too much on the attorney general’s office, or anybody who would need to enforce this. Allowing the interested party [to sue] allows them to go through other mechanisms in order to seek remediation.”

One of the most significant improvements for undocumented workers prior to the second Trump administration came with the federal DALE program, which allowed undocumented workers to avoid deportation if they had credible information about a workplace violation.

Before DALE, a complaint could mean losing a job.

“Complaining means they tell you they don’t need you anymore,” said Huerta, the worker from Puebla.

DALE gave labor agencies access to workers and victims when investigating a potential case of child labor violations or a preventable fatality.

“It made doing their work a bit easier,” said Ann Garcia, a senior staff attorney with the National Immigration Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. “Investigators could look into [reports] and not lose out on potential witnesses who otherwise wouldn’t have been there.”

However, Trump ended DALE soon after becoming president, a move first reported by Bloomberg Law.

Although only about 7,700 people had been granted DALE status by late 2024 (a fraction of the undocumented workforce), its end has had a ripple effect: Worker centers and community groups told Bloomberg they stopped filing applications altogether, fearing immigration authorities could use the personal information.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processed DALE applications, did not respond to questions from Investigate Midwest.

“Unfortunately, we’re kind of back to a situation today where neither of these agencies can do their work adequately,” Garcia said. “There’s really no possibility at this point of getting this kind of relief.”

Garcia believes DALE could make a comeback, though, with the next administration in 2029.

“I am hopeful that if we get a change in an administration that’s more positive, then we might be able to pick up from where we left off,” she said. “We were just getting started building trust and getting the word out.”

Fear of ICE shapes life inside Chicago’s warehouses

For many warehouse workers, the greatest fear is an ICE raid.

Chicago has been a focal point for the Department of Homeland Security, but federal agents have focused mostly on street arrests, using traffic checkpoints or entering public parks.

Workplace raids have been rare, but there’s worry from both employers and employees.

Some workers, who did not want their names published for fear of deportation, said they worry each time they leave for work. “I think we all worry about whether we’re going to come back or not,” said a mother of two from Mexico.

Brenda Palomares, a worker from the Mexican state of Guerrero, said the fear in her community reminds her of the shelter-in-place rules during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think that this year, this year in particular, will be a year that no one will ever forget,” Palomares said. “It will go down in history, just like the pandemic. Right now, we’re in another pandemic, but it’s Trump’s pandemic, because they are tearing so many families apart.”

Since Trump took office, several food processing and warehouse businesses have reached out to local worker centers to ask how they should handle a raid.

“We’re normally training workers and fighting the boss, but now we’re helping to train bosses how (to) protect your workers,” said Shelly Ruzicka, communications and finance director for ARISE, an advocacy group for temporary workers.

Kevin Amaro from Illinois Workers in Action, a Chicago-based worker center, said that preparing for an ICE raid is a lot like conducting a fire drill. It involves educating management about what their rights are and what to do if ICE comes to their facility, because “a lot of employers are scared, too.”

“We have a checklist…we really work with companies to strategize and figure out this plan,” Amaro said. “ I mean real training, not just ‘here’s a 10-minute talk. Here’s a flyer.’ Great. You ready? No, like an actual in-depth, 40 minutes or more, check-in and plan.”

He emphasized the importance of not volunteering information beyond what’s legally required, and understanding the difference between audits, E-Verify checks and raids.

“There’s rights for everyone,” he said, “no matter your immigration status.”

The lawsuit filed Monday by Illinois and Chicago alleges Trump’s authorization Saturday to deploy 300 troops to the Windy City is “unlawful and dangerous.”

Trump continues to flex federal power and claims the troops are needed to protect federal buildings during immigration enforcement efforts.

But a federal judge Sunday told Trump he couldn’t send troops to Oregon — hours after that state’s governor said 101 California National Guard members already had arrived Saturday with more on the way and headed to Portland.

Sending the National Guard to states despite their governor’s objections is not a new idea in Trump’s inner circle.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in November 2023 that a second Trump administration would order the Guard in sympathetic Republican-led states to Democrat-run states that refuse to cooperate with his drive for mass deportations.

“The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia. And if you’re going to go into an unfriendly state like Maryland, well, there would just be Virginia doing the arrest in Maryland, right, very close, very nearby,” Miller said at the time on “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

READ MORE: Chicago and Illinois sue to block Trump’s Guard deployment plan after Portland ruling

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand with federal law enforcement activity in Portland, Chicago and elsewhere:

Trump’s efforts meet pushback

The lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago comes after Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said some 300 of the state’s guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to the nation’s third-largest city, along with 400 others from Texas.

The ACLU of Illinois also filed suit Monday against Trump, DHS, ICE, Border Patrol and several of these agencies’ national and local leaders, accusing them of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of protests outside an ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois.

At the facility, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago, federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response and at least seven people have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

Filed by a coalition of news outlets, media associations and protesters — including the Illinois Press Association, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Headline Club — the lawsuit alleges federal agents used “indiscriminate” and “violent force,” including tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and flash grenades, interfering with First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and press.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint says.

Latest federal deployments target Portland, Chicago

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed that the president authorized using the Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness” that local leaders have not quelled.

Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest, calling the former a “war zone” and suggesting apocalyptic force was needed to quell problems in the latter. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore, Maryland; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek talked to Trump in late September and said the deployment was unnecessary. She refused to call up any Oregon National Guard troops, so Trump did so himself in an order to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. That prompted the lawsuit from city and state officials.

In Chicago, alarms raised about racial profiling

On Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order barring federal agents from using city-owned property as staging areas. It applies to parking lots, garages and vacant lots.

“We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority,” Johnson said in a statement.

The sight of armed, camouflaged and masked Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous downtown landmarks has amplified concerns about racial profiling. Many Chicagoans were already uneasy after an immigration crackdown began earlier this month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged that federal agents shot a woman Saturday morning on the southwest side of Chicago. A statement from the department said it happened after Border Patrol agents patrolling the area “were rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

“The officers exited their trapped vehicle, when a suspect tried to run them over, forcing the officers to fire defensively,” the statement said.

No law enforcement officers were seriously injured, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

The woman who was shot was a U.S. citizen and was armed with a semiautomatic weapon, according to McLaughlin.

The woman was in fair condition at a hospital, according to fire officials.

Deployment in Portland blocked by judge

About 400 protesters marched Saturday from a park to a Portland ICE detention facility. Federal agents used chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls, the Oregonian reported.

At least six people were arrested as the group reached the facility.

Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut later issued her first ruling temporarily blocking the deployment on Saturday afternoon, saying the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing that the deployment could harm Oregon’s state sovereignty.

The Trump administration responded with another attempt to send in National Guard troops from California and Texas, prompting Kotek and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, to go back to court Sunday. Immergut granted the request, blocking any National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon for 14 days.

Efforts in Memphis and Louisiana

On Wednesday, Hegseth, Bondi and Miller rallied members of a federal law enforcement task force that began operating in Memphis as part of Trump’s crime-fighting plan. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has supported the effort.

On Sept. 30, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry asked for a guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities to help fight crime.

He said there has been “elevated violent crime rates” in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, as well as shortages in local law enforcement.

Appellate court weighs California deployment

Trump deployed guard soldiers and active duty Marines in Los Angeles during the summer over the objections of Gov. Newsom, who sued and won a temporary block after a federal judge found the president’s use of the guard was likely unlawful.

The Trump administration appealed, and the block was put on hold by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate case is still underway, but the panel has indicated that it believes the administration is likely to prevail.

Last year, the Biden administration paused the contract with Paragon Solutions, which operates Graphite, while it conducted a review to ensure it complied with an executive order issued in 2023 which limits the government’s use of spyware. In August, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, news that was first reported by All-Source Intelligence.

The letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was signed by Democratic Reps. Summer Lee (Pennsylvania), Shontel Brown (Ohio), and Yassamin Ansari (Arizona).

The lawmakers asked Noem to provide information on the government’s use of surveillance technology by October 14, including “a comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE’s strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States.”

The lawmakers warned that allowing ICE to use to spyware “threatens Americans’ freedom of movement and freedom of speech.”

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” they wrote.

Paragon was founded in 2019 by former Israeli military intelligence officers who worked in the Israeli military’s Unit 8200. Last year, the Florida-based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, bought Paragon.

Recently, Microsoft blocked Unit 8200’s access to its cloud software after an investigation published in The Guardian revealed that the unit was using the cloud to store information on Palestinians — information that was then used to plan deadly attacks on Gaza.

Paragon has been repeatedly accused of violating people’s human rights. Earlier this year, the company was embroiled in a scandal after investigations revealed that the software had been used to spy on activists and journalists in Europe.

“There’s no link to click, attachment to download, file to open or mistake to make,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, told the Associated Press of Graphite. “One moment the phone is yours, and the next minute its data is streaming to an attacker,” he said.

Researchers with The Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto, conducted a forensic analysis of two reporters’ phones — “a prominent European journalist” who asked to remain anonymous, and Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino. Both journalists’ phones were targeted with Graphite, according to the researchers’ report released in June.

Amnesty International says Graphite “can never be human rights compliant and should be banned.”

“Paragon’s Graphite spyware product is a form of highly invasive spyware capable of covertly accessing the most intimate and sensitive data on an individual’s phone, and cannot be independently audited,” the group said in March.

The letter to Noem comes as the Trump administration has targeted anyone it perceives as an enemy, including pro-Palestine activists, anti-ICE protesters, and Democratic elected officials. On Friday, the administration deported award-winning journalist Mario Guevara for livestreaming law enforcement activities, which is protected by the First Amendment.

In comments to Truthout on Monday, Lee said that she will “not allow ICE to operate in the shadows.”

“Once that kind of surveillance is allowed, it rarely stays limited to whatever the government claims it is for,” she said. “History shows what happens when governments are given this kind of unchecked access.

Fire destroys home of South Carolina judge who had received death threats

Edward Helmore

The cause of a huge fire at the beachfront home of a South Carolina judge who had reportedly been subjected to death threats is being investigated by state law enforcement investigators.

The blaze at the home of Diane Goodstein – a Democrat-appointed circuit court judge – erupted on Saturday, sending three members of her family to the hospital, including her husband, a former state senator.

However, Goodstein, 69, was walking her dogs at the time the blaze erupted at the three-story home in the luxury gated community on Edisto Beach in Colleton county.

A spokesperson for the South Carolina state law enforcement division (Sled) confirmed it was investigating a fire in the county. “The investigation is active and ongoing. More information may be available as the investigation continues,” a Sled spokesperson told FITSNews.

For his part, John Kittredge, the South Carolina chief justice, told the outlet: “At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Sled chief Mark Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security.”

Goodstein, who has served on the state judicial bench since 1989, in September issued a temporary injunction on the release of the state’s voter files to the Trump administration-led US justice department.

Goodstein’s ruling was later publicly criticized by an assistant attorney general for the justice department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon. The division has been at the forefront of efforts to acquire information, including names, addresses, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers, of more than 3 million registered voters under an executive order targeting “non-citizen voter registration”.

During her press briefing, Leavitt also claimed that the Democratic funding proposal would “require Medicaid to pay more for emergency care provided to illegal aliens than it does for American patients who are disabled, elderly or children”.

This statement is not true, mainly because emergency Medicaid is a way for hospitals to get reimbursement for providing care for any patient, regardless of immigration status, as required under federal law. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by the president earlier this year, cut those federal dollars, and Democrats are seeking to reverse that through their funding extension.

What’s more, according to a recent analysis by KFF, emergency Medicaid spending accounted for less than 1% of the program’s total expenditure between 2017-2023.

White House reaffirms that layoffs will be an 'unfortunate consequence' of government shutdown, blames Democratic lawmakers

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the layoffs that the president has telegraphed will be an “unfortunate consequence” of the government shutdown – of which the administration continues to blame Democratic members of congress.

“This conversation about layoffs would not be happening right now if the Democrats did not vote to shut the government down,” Leavitt said.

The administration, including Russ Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget, has said that the sweeping reductions-in-force (RIFs) would come as a byproduct of the government shutdown if Trump feels that negotiations to pass a funding extension remain at a standstill.

The Senate will reconvene later today, where the dueling stopgap bills are poised to be rejected again. “We hope that the vote will not fail, because this administration wants to reopen the government. We don’t want to see people laid off,” Leavitt added.

Leavitt calls Trump-appointed judge 'untethered in reality' following national guard ruling

Karoline Leavitt said that the ruling from Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointed federal judge, was “untethered in reality”.

Immergut temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any national guard units to Oregon, saying that there was no evidence that recent protests necessitated the presence of national guard troops.

Leavitt said that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Portland has been “really under siege by these anarchists”.

“They have been disrespecting law enforcement. They’ve been inciting violence,” she added. “We are appealing that decision, as you know, we expect a hearing on it pretty quickly, and we’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this.”

Leavitt went on to criticize Democratic leaders throughout the country, like JB Pritzker and Gavin Newsom, for pushing back against the administration’s use of federal troops in blue cities.

“Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place? They should be concerned about this. They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night, and the president all he’s trying to do is fix it,” the press secretary said.

White House touts ongoing negotiations in Egypt as 'incredible achievement'

Karoline Leavitt branded the ongoing technical talks in Egypt between negotiators, including special envoy Steve Witkoff, as “incredible”.

“The president wants to see a cease fire. He wants to see the hostages released, and the technical teams are discussing that as we speak, to ensure that the environment is perfect to release those hostages,” Leavitt said. “They’re going over the list of both the Israeli hostages and also the political prisoners who will be released. And those talks are underway, and the President is very much on the ball and is being apprised of this situation.”

The press secretary just noted that Donald Trump has been in touch with Republican leadership on Capitol Hill.

“The president is being kept very well apprised of the ongoing shutdown,” Leavitt said. “His position is very clear. There’s nothing to negotiate. Just reopen the government and then we can talk about all the important issues facing our country.”

White House repeats misleading claims that Democrats are trying to fund health care for ‘illegal aliens’

At today’s press briefing, Karoline Leavitt continued to repeat the misleading claims from the president and congressional Republicans that the Democrats’ version of a stopgap funding bill is seeking to fund health care for “illegal aliens”.

This is not accurate, as we’ve reported extensively. Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for federally funded health insurance. The Democrats’ funding patch seeks to reverse many of the cuts to Medicaid that are set to take effect after Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda passed earlier this year.

This includes allowing lawfully present noncitizens to still enroll in certain federal health care programs. Leavitt called these immigrants “illegal aliens” who “improperly were granted asylum and paroled under the Biden administration”. All of these people have entered the country legally and are accounted for by the federal government.

Ahead of the White House press briefing, it’s worth noting that a short while ago, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, signed an executive order to establish “Ice free zones” throughout the city.

This order prohibits immigration agents from using city property to carry out any federal immigration operations. “We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority,” Johnson said.

He went on to support Illinois governor JB Pritzker’s lawsuit against the Trump administration for deploying National Guard troops to Chicago. “We reject any attempt to occupy Chicago and we will use every tool at our disposal to resist this federal overreach,” the mayor added.

The order expands upon Mayor Johnson’s Protecting Chicago initiative, inviting local businesses and community organizations to join the citywide effort to safeguard our communities, while advancing measures to rein in the reckless behavior of federal immigration agents.

“We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority. ICE agents are detaining elected officials, tear-gassing protestors, children, and Chicago police officers, and abusing Chicago residents. We will not stand for that in our city,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “With this Executive Order, Chicago stands firm in protecting the Constitutional rights of our residents and immigrant communities and upholding our democracy.”

Mayor Johnson’s most recent Protecting Chicago executive order comes following documented use of Chicago Public Schools parking lots and a City-owned parking lot at Harrison and Kedzie as staging sites for federal immigration enforcement operations, a violation of Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance. The use of City resources for these actions erodes trust between immigrant communities and the City, weakening the relationships that are essential to ensuring community safety and constitutional policing.

Under Mayor Johnon’s leadership, the City is taking swift and decisive action to prevent these transgressions and wield municipal power to protect the safety, dignity, and human rights of every Chicagoan, regardless of race, religion, immigration status, or national origin. As ordered by Mayor Johnson, City Departments and agencies will identify all spaces that have been or may be used for federal immigration enforcement operations. City workers will then ensure that all such properties exhibit clear signage stating:

This property is owned and/or controlled by the City of Chicago.

It may not be used for civil immigration enforcement, including as a:

Staging area

Processing location

Operations base

City Departments and Agencies are directed to implement this order within five days. This could include, but is not limited to, ensuring that, wherever possible, physical barriers such as locked gates are used to limit access to City property for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.

The measure directs that City employees immediately report any attempted use of City property for immigration enforcement; any such instance will be reported to the Office of the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel.

The directive is the latest City-led effort to protect the Constitutional rights of every Chicagoan in concert with Mayor Johnson’s landmark Protecting Chicago initiative. Under Mayor Johnson’s leadership, the City is taking proactive steps to maintain essential trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement while ensuring every Chicagoan can feel safe while accessing City services.

In widely reported incidents, federal agents have been caught on video deploying tear gas outside a public school, acting outside their jurisdiction while putting a resident in a chokehold, and handcuffing a sitting member of the Chicago City Council.

In the wake of the ongoing incursion on the Constitutional rights of Chicagoans and the operations of federal immigration agents designed to stoke fear in communities across Chicago, Mayor Johnson is taking decisive action to protect Chicago’s immigrant community and the Constitutional rights of all Chicagoans.

Today’s order enables increased community participation in the Protecting Chicago initiative. The Mayor’s Office will design and distribute official signage, free of charge, that private landowners and leaseholders can post on their property. The signage clearly states that no federal immigration agents may enter for the purpose of civil immigration enforcement and that the property may not be used as a staging area, processing location, or operations base.

The City will distribute “Know Your Rights” materials that explain the rights of employees, tenants, and security staff when approached by federal agents seeking access to a property

This order does not prohibit the lawful use of City property for purposes unrelated to federal immigration enforcement.

Additional information on Protecting Chicago can be found at chicago.gov/protect. The signed Executive Order will be posted on the City Clerk’s website.

President Trump and Illinois leaders escalated their legal battle over the deployment of National Guard troops to the state Monday, after Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.
President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday criticized a federal judge for blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, calling her ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

“The president has the right to call up the National Guard in cases where he deems it appropriate,” Leavitt said during a news briefing, accusing protesters outside a Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility of “inciting violence.”

Leavitt’s criticism came after US District Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy National Guard troops from other states to the ICE facility.

The administration has since filed an appeal, which Leavitt said Trump expects to win.

“We’re confident in the president’s legal authority to do this, and we’re very confident we will win on the merits of the law,” she said.

Pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on the administration’s justification for ordering the National Guard to Portland, Leavitt said protesters at the ICE facility had been “disrespecting law enforcement.” She added that the White House will soon host “independent journalists” who have been at the protests to share their first-person accounts.

Over the weekend, demonstrators gathered outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, a Chicago suburb. Six people were arrested Saturday and one on Sunday, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spent part of Friday on the rooftop of the controversial facility, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew, according to CNN affiliate WLS.

In recent weeks, protests at the facility have been met with tear gas and use of force, including against lawmakers.

Daniel Biss, the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, who is also running for Congress, said he was teargassed at a protest outside Broadview and called the experience “terrifying.” Kat Abughazaleh, a former journalist also running for Congress, was pushed to the ground by a federal law enforcement agent in camouflage, wearing a full face covering, sunglasses and a helmet, during the same protest, according to video from CNN affiliate WBBM.

After a protest Friday, Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes said she was handcuffed in a hospital emergency room during a confrontation with two men she said were ICE agents. Neither was wearing badges.

In their lawsuit Monday to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, city and state leaders argue the military is not necessary to keep order during ongoing protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the suburb of Broadview.

“The manufactured nature of the crisis is clear,” the lawsuit states.

Arguing that the need for extra protection in response to protests around federal facilities is only a pretext to deploy the military inside the United States, the 67-page lawsuit cites President Trump’s own words, calling for military action in Chicago even before his second term began.

“The next president needs to send the National Guard to the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago until safety can be restored,” Trump said in July 2022, the lawsuit notes.

The plaintiffs also note the president’s provocative words in a speech last week to military generals in Quantico, Virginia.

“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military – National Guard, but military – because we’re going into Chicago very soon,” Trump said.

While Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is fighting Trump’s effort to federalize the Illinois National Guard, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott volunteered 400 of his state’s troops to be deployed to other states at Trump’s discretion.

Even with Abbott’s cooperation, Illinois argues the deployment of Texas assets to Chicago would be ” in excess of constitutional and statutory authority.”

“There is no insurrection in Illinois,” the lawsuit states. “There is no rebellion in Illinois.”

Federal law enforcement officers and protesters clashed outside an ICE detention facility in Portland, Oregon, on Sunday night in the wake of a federal judge’s ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to the city.

According to video, agents wearing tactical gear – labeled as police, Border Patrol and Department of Homeland Security – deployed gas canisters and stood face-to-face with demonstrators who were shouting and taunting the officers with obscenities and vulgar gestures.

Portland protesters clash with federal agents

In a video filmed on Sunday evening, protesters can be seen clashing with federal agents outside Portland's ICE detention facility. This comes as a federal judge blocked President Trump from sending the National Guard to Oregon.

Portland protesters clash with federal agents

00:50

Many of the protesters wore gas masks, and at least one protester was carried off handcuffed by three federal agents.

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement there were two arrests made on Sunday night in the area of the protests. In total, 36 arrests have been made in the South Waterfront area since the nightly protests began in June, police said.

The context: The protests outside the Portland detention facility have been going on since summer. President Donald Trump has used clashes between protesters and law enforcement outside the facility as justification for deploying the National Guard to protect federal agents at the facility, and to stop the “violent protests” carried out by “domestic terrorists,” he said.

CNN has reached out to ICE and DHS for comment on Sunday night’s activity and number of arrests made.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order Monday prohibiting ICE and other federal agencies from using city property for immigration enforcement.

Johnson said the order is aimed at “reining in this out-of-control administration.” The city also joined the state of Illinois Monday in a lawsuit against Trump’s deployment of the National Guard.

Johnson’s order bars federal agents from using city-owned property for federal immigration operations and encourages local businesses and city organizations to safeguard individual rights, his office said.

“Private establishments can partner with us to make it clear that private property is private property, that ICE cannot enter establishments without a valid warrant,” Johnson said at a news conference Monday.

Johnson said the city may be forced to take further action in the coming weeks.

President Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts to move the military into Chicago and Portland, Oregon, is facing legal challenges on both fronts.

The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional.”

Over the weekend, Trump authorized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago to “protect federal officers and assets.” Another 400 members of the Texas National Guard may be deployed there with the cooperation of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Trump’s plan to use the National Guard to help protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June was blocked by a federal judge.

Judge Karin Immergut, who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2019, issued an order Saturday preventing the Oregon National Guard from being federalized for the operation.

Immergut ordered the next day that no Guardsmen from any state could be deployed in Oregon for at least two weeks while she considers the case.

The decision was issued after the Trump administration tried an end-around of the original order by deploying federalized troops from the California National Guard to Portland on Sunday, which led to the state of California joining the lawsuit.

President Trump and Illinois leaders escalated their legal battle over the deployment of National Guard troops to the state Monday, after Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN.

Meanwhile, state leaders vowed to continue fighting the decision in court.

“Illinois is taking the Trump Administration to court for their unlawful and unconstitutional deployment of military troops to our state,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said on X Monday, thanking the state’s attorney general for “helping defend the rule of law.”

The state’s lawsuit argues that the Trump administration has not provided a legitimate legal explanation for its deployment of the troops, “and none exists,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement released by his office.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” Raoul said in the statement.

Over the weekend, an American woman was shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago, according to the Department of Homeland Security and a charging complaint.

The complaint states that on Saturday, Marimar Martinez and a “convoy” of other civilian vehicles followed a CBP vehicle before “driving into and striking” it.

A CBP agent then got out of his car and fired at Martinez five times. DHS described the shots as “defensive” and said the woman was armed “with a semi-automatic weapon,” although the complaint does not state that she was armed or used a weapon. No law enforcement agents were seriously injured in the incident, according to DHS.

Martinez was treated for a gunshot wound at a hospital and released. She is now in FBI custody, according to DHS.

CNN has reached out to Martinez’ attorney for comment.

Martinez isn’t the first driver to be shot by federal agents during intensified immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. In September, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who worked as a cook, after a traffic stop. DHS said he resisted arrest and dragged an officer with his vehicle.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-06t053210z-1296236702-rc256haohtzw-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-portland.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-06 14:01:31.479748

No reply. Another knock; nothing. Then Herrera walked to the side of the building, where he saw what he said were two guards behind the facility’s fence. He asked them if they knew anything about his client, Willian Giménez González, who had been taken by ICE that morning in Little Village, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Chicago. According to Herrera, ICE agents stopped Giménez González while he was driving with his wife to get a haircut. They took him away and left his wife, who can’t drive, alone in the car.

The guards listened to Herrera for a moment, then walked away, one of them throwing up a hand as if to say: “Who cares?”

More from Emma Janssen

Herrera left the facility that day with no idea where Giménez González was being held. The next morning, he returned to Broadview with elected officials, other advocates, and Giménez González’s wife to hold a press conference demanding information from ICE. At the end of the press conference, Giménez González’s wife received a phone call from her husband. He confirmed that he was being held in Broadview, just behind the building’s boarded-up windows and chain-link fence.

“His wife handed me the phone. I was talking to him, and his tone changed, and someone asked him who he was talking to,” Herrera said. “And he said, ‘a lawyer.’ And then he told me later that he was made to get off the phone.”

After the press conference, Herrera went home to file a writ of habeas corpus for Giménez González, a legal mechanism that would force a court to re-evaluate Giménez González’s detention and provide a clear justification for it. He filed the petition at midnight, and went to bed.

At 8 the next morning, Giménez González’s wife called Herrera and told him that ICE had transferred her husband out of state. That move nullified Herrera’s legal action. “Because he was in another state at the time that I filed the habeas petition, it couldn’t be heard in Illinois, and the judge just sort of waved it away and transferred it to where he’s being held,” Herrera explained. “I’m not going to talk about where he is [now], because one of the things I’m concerned about is him being moved again.”

HERRERA AND GIMÉNEZ GONZÁLEZ’S EXPERIENCE is increasingly common under ICE’s current regime. It’s not just happening in Chicago, either. Attorneys in New York and Los Angeles told the Prospect similar stories to Herrera’s, outlining how ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate their detainees from both their families and their lawyers, limiting their ability to get out of their predicaments and increasing misery and hopelessness.

Only 23 percent of defendants in immigration court have an attorney in court to represent them. Unlike in criminal courts, defendants in immigration court are not entitled to representation. But even those who do have attorneys are struggling to connect with them.

A data investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that so far this year, 12 percent of ICE detainees have been transferred four or more times. That’s double the number relative to last year.

ICE has a number of stated reasons for these transfers, attorneys told me. Sometimes, the agency says it’s a matter of space. Due to pressure from the administration, ICE is working to meet aggressive arrest quotas, leading to inhumane crowding in their detention facilities.

In Illinois, a well-intentioned law has played into ICE’s hands, giving the agency an excuse to transfer detainees out of state. In 2021, the state passed the Illinois Way Forward Act, which ended immigration detention in the state. When ICE arrests people in Illinois, they are processed at the facility in Broadview and then quickly transferred to facilities in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Kentucky.

“It has functionally meant … that when a person is arrested in Illinois, the government can justify taking them hundreds of miles from their family,” Herrera said of the law.

ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate detainees from both their families and their lawyers.

He said that in court, government lawyers used the law to explain why Giménez González was transferred out of state so quickly. But Herrera pointed to local reporting that says some detainees are held in Illinois’s Broadview facility for as many as five days. That leads him to believe that Giménez González’s transfer was retaliatory, or for the express purpose of keeping him away from his advocates.

Melissa Chua, who leads the Immigration Protection Unit of the New York Legal Assistance Group, said that it’s hard to know exactly why ICE moves its detainees, but that the results are clear.

“The outcome is that it is immensely cruel, and that people who actually do have rights are being strongly pressured to give them up,” Chua said.

New York has a universal defender system, which means that detainees are entitled to representation when they are within the state. But when ICE transfers detainees out of state, they lose that right. “[ICE is] not just isolating them emotionally, but taking them practically away from places where they would have had counsel,” Chua said.

These transfers then lead to a bureaucratic hellscape for those who have been arrested, their families, and their lawyers.

Chua described one client who was moved between five different facilities within the span of eight days. Because of how quickly he was being moved and inaccuracies in ICE’s detainee tracking database, her team was unable to speak with the detainee ahead of the briefing on his habeas case. They kept setting up calls, only to find out that he had been moved to an entirely different facility. “We weren’t able to even confirm that he wanted representation, because we couldn’t even speak to him,” she said.

A CHANGE OF FACILITY BRINGS a host of logistical issues. “It’s never straightforward,” said Ming Tanigawa-Lau, a staff attorney at Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles. “Every place has a different way of requesting a meeting, rules about how far in advance you have to request it, who to contact, what hours they can receive calls at.”

The confusion often means lawyers simply can’t meet with their clients—amounting to a lack of access to counsel. “Maybe if the systems that they had set up were functional, it would be acceptable,” Tanigawa-Lau said, referring to the phone, email, and meeting systems she and other attorneys are navigating. “They’re telling the attorneys that we all have this kind of access. But in practice, it doesn’t work.”

What’s more, ICE detention facilities don’t have a system that allows lawyers to remotely share documents with their clients, or vice versa. That means that lawyers and clients need to meet in person to share and review documents, which becomes complicated when clients are moved out of state and meetings are difficult to schedule.

Immigration attorneys can practice in any state, so having a client transferred out of state doesn’t necessarily mean their connection is severed. But in practice, attorneys told me, their inability to speak to their clients, review legal documents with them, and travel to appear in court functionally means they can’t represent their clients—or, at least, makes it much harder to.

Many immigration judges require clients and attorneys to appear in court in person, rather than virtually over video call. Tanigawa-Lau has represented clients virtually after they had been transferred to a different state, but her colleagues have had to fly out to appear in court. Chua said her team couldn’t represent a client who was transferred from New York to Arizona.

ICE is supposed to notify attorneys when they transfer their clients, Tanigawa-Lau says, but in practice the agency doesn’t. Sometimes, she won’t even know that ICE has transferred her client until she gets a call from their family informing her. That’s what happened in the case of Willian Giménez González in Chicago.

Keeping in touch with clients in other states is a major hurdle. Tanigawa-Lau described being on hold for over 30 minutes just to leave a message for a client, waiting days to schedule a meeting, and having to drive two hours to meet in person at the nearest detention facility to her in Los Angeles.

“One time I had to set up a call for a client on a Monday, and when I got there … I found out that he was actually deported the Saturday before,” she said.

CHUA, IN NEW YORK, IS DEEPLY CONCERNED that this lack of due process is leading to illegal and immoral deportations. Though she gave the caveat that she doesn’t have a specific example, she told me she’s almost certain that ICE has deported U.S. citizens who simply weren’t able to assert their rights without access to a lawyer and their community.

The stakes of ICE detentions and transfers seem higher today than they’ve ever been, due to recent legal decisions that have amped up the cruelty at ICE facilities. Just a month ago, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that anyone who enters the country without inspection doesn’t qualify for bond.

“So, they’re not only moving people hundreds of miles away,” Herrera explained, “but those people can’t get out at all. It’s a really punitive and desperate situation for them.” On top of that, the government’s quotas for arrests mean that detention facilities are inhumanely crowded. Chua said that New York’s 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration court that’s been a highly public site of ICE cruelty, has just four cells where up to 70 people have been held at the same time.

“Because of … the denial of access to counsel, there really aren’t any safeguards or stopgaps that keep someone from being moved or held,” Herrera said. “Everything we worry about when a person is in jail—all bets are off once you don’t have access to a lawyer.”

All told, ICE’s practices of transfers, isolation, and overcrowding amount to a desperate situation where due process rights are too easily ignored. “To me, it seems like cruelty is the point,” Chua said.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23639/download/Janssen-ICE%20Chicago%20100625.jpg?cb=122099bf79dc3718f22072d6839cbf77&w=1024,N,,2025-10-06 14:58:01.142461

The DOJ attorneys wrote that the detainees at the Everglades facility have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.
During a July 25 news conference outside the detention center, DeSantis said, ""Everybody here is already on a final removal order.""
He added, ""So, if you have an order to be removed, what is the possible objection to the federal government enforcing that removal order?""
Federal officials on Friday confirmed that Florida has been approved for a $608 million reimbursement for the costs of building and running the immigration detention center.","U.S. government lawyers say that detainees at the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" likely include people who have never been in removal proceedings, which is a direct contradiction to what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been saying since it opened in July.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice made that admission Thursday in a court filing arguing that the detainees at the facility in the Everglades wilderness don't have enough in common to be certified as a class in a lawsuit over whether they're getting proper access to attorneys.

A removal proceeding is a legal process initiated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to determine if someone should be deported from the United States.

The DOJ attorneys wrote that the detainees at the Everglades facility have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.

""The proposed class includes all detainees at Alligator Alcatraz, a facility that houses detainees in all stages of immigration processing — presumably including those who have never been in removal proceedings, those who will be placed into removal proceedings, those who are already subject to final orders of removal, those subject to expedited removal, and those detained for the purpose of facilitation removal from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal,"" they wrote.

Since the facility opened, DeSantis has been saying publicly that each detainee has gone through the process of determining that they can't legally be in the United States.

During a July 25 news conference outside the detention center, DeSantis said, ""Everybody here is already on a final removal order.""

""They have been ordered to be removed from the country,"" he added.

At a July 29 speech before a conference of the Florida Sheriffs Association, the Republican governor said, ""The people that are going to the Alligator Alcatraz are illegally in the country. They've all already been given a final order of removal.""

He added, ""So, if you have an order to be removed, what is the possible objection to the federal government enforcing that removal order?""

DeSantis' press office didn't respond Monday morning to an email seeking comment.

The court filing by the DOJ attorneys was made in a lawsuit in which civil rights groups allege the facility's detainees have been denied proper access to attorneys in violation of their constitutional rights. The civil rights groups on Thursday asked a federal judge in Fort Myers for a preliminary injunction that would establish stronger protections for detainees to meet with attorneys privately and share documents confidentially.

The court case is one of three lawsuits filed by environmental and civil rights groups over the detention center, which was hastily built this summer by the state of Florida and operated by private contractors and state agencies.

A federal judge in Miami ordered in August that the facility must wind down operations within two months, agreeing with environmental groups that the remote airstrip site wasn't given a proper environmental review before it was converted into an immigration detention center. But operations continued after the judge's preliminary injunction was put on hold in early September by an appellate court panel. At one point, the facility held more than 900 detainees, but most of them were transferred after the initial injunction. It wasn't clear on Monday how many detainees were at the center, which was built to hold 3,000 people.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. Federal officials on Friday confirmed that Florida has been approved for a $608 million reimbursement for the costs of building and running the immigration detention center.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/09/4f94c8f2-61a1-4810-bac5-23d300451899/thumbnail/1200x630/2dc6911eede1c9c8f15f4f5c7fd1e64b/ap25193643742990.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 14:01:38.003245

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, names the Chicago Headline Club, Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Newspaper Guild, NABET-CWA Local 54041, the Illinois Press Association, and several individual journalists as plaintiffs. They allege that federal officers, acting under the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” targeted members of the press with rubber bullets, pepper balls, tear gas, flash grenades, and arbitrary arrests at demonstrations outside ICE’s Broadview.

“Federal agents have repeatedly fired less-lethal munitions directly at clearly identifiable members of the press,” the complaint states, describing what it calls a coordinated effort to “silence coverage of federal misconduct”.

Among those named as victims:

Raven Geary, a local reporter struck in the face with a pepper ball while taking a photograph, despite wearing a helmet marked “PRESS.”

Charles Thrush, a DePaul journalism student on assignment for Block Club Chicago, who was shot in the hand while filming.

Stephen Held, co-founder of Unraveled Press, tackled, handcuffed, and detained after documenting an arrest—while displaying multiple press credentials.

A CBS Chicago reporter who was attacked in her car when a federal officer fired pepper balls into her vehicle.

The lawsuit alleges violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, seeking injunctive relief to bar federal agents from further violence against journalists, protesters, and clergy who have gathered daily at Broadview in opposition to stepped-up deportations.

The complaint also ties the violence to high-level directives from President Donald Trump, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and other federal officials, accusing them of explicitly encouraging officers to “hammer” demonstrators and redefine protest zones as “free arrest zones.” It cites public comments by Trump labeling reporters “the enemy of the American people” and directing agents to suppress dissent in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.

Local leaders including Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have denounced the federal deployment as an unnecessary occupation. Broadview’s mayor warned that relentless use of tear gas has endangered village residents and first responders.

The lawsuit mirrors similar litigation in Los Angeles, where the L.A. Press Club won a temporary injunction limiting federal agents’ use of crowd-control weapons against reporters and peaceful demonstrators earlier this year. Plaintiffs in Chicago now hope for comparable protections.

“Journalists should not have to choose between their safety and their duty to inform the public,” the plaintiffs argue. “This is about protecting the First Amendment at its breaking point.”

While awaiting a retrial would delay final resolution, the vote switch here will allow the defendants to seek prompt review in New York’s highest court, and the liability judgment will remain while they do that. Allowing a judgment of liability to persist in the face of majority opposition is problematic.

It’s just the latest ICE-tracking initiative to be pulled by tech platforms in the past few days.

A Padlet customer service representative told Celeste, one of the project’s creators, that the map “was trashed due to violations of our Content Policy,” without specifying which policy was violated. Celeste has not disclosed her last name for safety reasons.

But days earlier, the right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had tweeted at Padlet’s CEO about the project.

“Are you aware that @padlet is being used by radical left wing domestic terrorists, illegal aliens and their supporters to obstruct law enforcement operations and harass ICE agents?” she wrote, “PADLET’s Content Policy clearly notes that harassment, stalking, privacy violations, inciting violence, and any other unlawful activity are not on the platform.”

In the same thread, Loomer claimed responsibility for the removal of several similar apps, including ICEBlock, from Apple’s and Google’s app stores last week.

Loomer’s remarks echo statements made by officials at the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security claiming that ICE-tracking projects are responsible for a “1000%” increase in assaults on ICE agents.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has described “violence” against ICE agents as “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxxing them, it’s videotaping them where they’re at when they’re out on operations,” while the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, has indicated that the department “will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

Transparency or doxxing?

Celeste started People over Papers in January, after connecting with other TikTok creators who were also sharing information about ICE raids in their communities. In the 10 months since, it has received over 19 million unique visitors and has been averaging between 200,000 and 300,000 users per day.

She came up with the idea of mapping the raids “to inform people of what is happening in their communities” and says the project is “documenting history and gathering information about something that will likely be looked back on as an extremely dark time.”

It is among a number of volunteer-led efforts, including the ICEBlock app that was removed from app stores last week and the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network, that map anonymous reports about immigration enforcement agents conducting raids.

The maps play an important role in “offer[ing] protection, solidarity, and survival strategies in hostile territory,” Allissa Richardson, a scholar at the University of Southern California who studies how marginalized communities use social media, told MIT Technology Review this summer. They serve as “modern-day Green Books for immigrant communities,” she said. “Just as Black travelers once used the Green Book to navigate safely through a landscape of racial terror, these digital tools help Latine families move through spaces marked by surveillance and risk.”

Pressuring technology platforms to remove the maps is just one part of the administration’s strategy to stop efforts to track ICE or identify its masked agents conducting raids. In early September, DHS subpoenaed Meta for the personal information of users behind the Instagram accounts of the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network and a number of other nonprofit organizations and rapid response networks; the subpoena has been temporarily blocked pending a court hearing.

At least one person has allegedly lost her job in connection to these apps. Carolyn Feinstein, whose husband ran the ICEBlock app, was terminated from her job with the Department of Justice over the summer, which she says was in retaliation for her husband’s work.

“Trying to blunt these efforts to hold federal officers accountable” has the effect of “chilling speech and activism,” says David Greene, the director of civil liberties at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He says that identifying agents does not count as doxxing, because “the idea that law enforcement would be masked and and therefore unaccountable to the people they are serving is really anathema to American values.”

“Saying the doxxing itself is an act of violence would require a different definition of violence than the one we've traditionally used in regards to legal issues,” says Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies threats to public officials.

For its part, the People over Papers map was back online six hours after it was removed from Padlet—this time on its own website, which Celeste’s team has been working on since May and had planned to launch next week.

Celeste says she isn’t cowed: “I am personally super stubborn. The more someone tells me I can’t do something, the more I want to do it.”

Besides, “if this information isn't posted on our platform, it will be posted on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and any other social media platform,” she says. “People will continue to inform each other one way or another.”","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25278024170174.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 12:57:43.877277

Hayes",,,,,https://michiganadvance.com/2025/10/06/immigration-isnt-the-crime-story-were-being-told/,"After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community.
Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city.
This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime.
These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants.
Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.","Drive through Hamtramck today and you’ll see a city that has found new life. After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community. Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city. Small businesses line the streets, families walk to school and the community has regained much of the vitality it had lost.

This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime. In April, when a Michigan lawmaker characterized immigrants as “violent gangbangers, perverts, scammers and all sorts of other criminals,” he was speaking to widely held but unsupported concerns following a surge in immigration. So, what does the evidence actually show?

Consider what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) own data tells us. According to ICE’s September 2025 records from Michigan, the overwhelming majority of those detained, 86%, are classified as having “No ICE Threat Level,” with no prior criminal convictions. Decades of research have actually found that people who are undocumented are more than 30% less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.

What we’re seeing in Hamtramck reflects a broader trend documented across the country, where immigrant communities often contribute to neighborhood stability rather than undermining it. In fact, of the top 10 Michigan cities with the highest proportion of foreign-born residents, the majority had lower than average property crime and violent crime given both their size and poverty levels.

Why would this be? Laurence Benenson, policy liaison at the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force — a group primarily composed of police officers — observes that immigration is highly self-selective; the people willing to uproot their lives are typically motivated, law-abiding individuals, not criminals looking to exploit the system. This explains why crime rates often drop as immigrants move into an area.

Yet media coverage tells a dramatically altered story. Between 2022 and 2024, Fox News aired nearly 1,000 segments on “migrant crime,” with coverage jumping 880% in early 2024. These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants. At the same time, claims that the U.S. is under invasion by transnational Latin American gangs, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, have been used to justify the use of the Alien Enemies Act, enabling deportations without due process.

But Maya Barak, who teaches criminology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and specifically studied transnational Latin American gangs like MS-13, says these groups tend to be concentrated on the coasts and aren’t considered a significant public safety threat in Michigan. She adds that most gang violence is between and among rivals and tends not to extend into the community, where they don’t have a foothold.

Under the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, with H.R.1 transforming ICE into the highest-funded domestic enforcement agency, arrests have increased 150% in Michigan. Raids can now proceed at schools, churches and hospitals. Six Michigan cities and counties have signed potentially costly 287(g) agreements, deputizing local law enforcement for immigration duties and paving the way for mass deportation.

This enforcement environment undermines public safety. According to Barak, it pushes people underground out of fear, endangering community trust and limiting law enforcement. Current policies are terrorizing immigrant communities, preventing them from contacting emergency services, which are often intertwined with local police, discouraging life-saving calls.

Happy First Monday! On the first Monday of each month, you get a longer version of the Roundup with the headlines plus reading recommendations, job postings, events, and many other features. The first Monday in October is extra special because it is also the opening day for the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2025 Term.

In 2010, I wrote a law review article called “The Supreme Court’s Increased Attention to the Law of Lawyering: Mere Coincidence or Something More?” I described what has turned out to be the high-water mark for cases involving legal ethics issues taken up by the Supreme Court in a particular term. There were seventeen — seventeen! — such cases during the 2009 Term. You can read the full article here if you want to know more about the cases from the 2009 Term.

But what about the Supreme Court’s docket for the upcoming term? So far we have only one. But to be fair the Court has only granted cert to a few dozen cases to date. I’ll be keeping an eye out. For now, here’s an overview of Villarreal v. Texas, which will be argued today. Along with several other legal ethics scholars, I joined an amicus brief filed in this case. At issue is whether a trial court violates a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by prohibiting the defendant and his lawyer from discussing testimony during an overnight recess. We argue that a ban on discussions like this jeopardizes the lawyer’s compliance with core professional responsibilities and undermines attorney-client privilege and the duty of confidentiality.

In totally-unrelated-to-legal-ethics news, I’ve been listening nonstop to the newly-released album from Taylor Swift, The Life of a Showgirl (reviewed here by The New York Times – gift link). At the moment, my favorite tracks are CANCELLED! and Opalite. Whatever you think of her music, she always leaves her fans with something to look forward to. I hope that’s what I’m doing here for legal ethics fans each week!

Now, let’s get started with the headlines. Don’t forget to keep scrolling down to the very end for all the “First Monday” extra features. Enjoy!

Highlights from the Past Week – Top Ten Headlines

#1 “Texas Plans to End ABA’s Role in State’s Law School Oversight.” From Reuters: “The Supreme Court of Texas said in an order on Friday that it ‘is of the tentative opinion that the ABA should no longer have the final say’ on whether a law school’s alumni can sit for the Texas Bar or be licensed….University of Houston law dean Leonard Baynes told Reuters on Monday that he was pleased the court showed commitment to law degree portability and avoiding onerous requirements on law schools. But Baynes said the ‘order creates uncertainty for legal education in the backdrop of an already chaotic world of higher education.’” Read more here.

#2 “The Justice Department Seeks Information on the Georgia D.A. Who Prosecuted Trump.” From the New York Times: “The Department of Justice has issued a subpoena for records related to the travel history of Fani T. Willis, the Georgia district attorney who charged President Trump in a sweeping election interference case, according to a federal grand jury subpoena reviewed by The New York Times. The scope of the investigation is not yet clear. Also unclear is whether Ms. Willis is the target of the inquiry and whether she will ultimately face charges. Grand jury proceedings are secretive by law. But the document reviewed by The Times is an indication that the Justice Department under President Trump may be investigating another one of his old foes.” Read more here.

#3 “Michigan Justices Issue Scaled-Back Judicial Anti-Bias Rule.” From Bloomberg Law: “The Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday tweaked a conduct rule barring judges from exhibiting bias or harassing those in their courtrooms, but didn’t go as far as a proposal from earlier this year. The rule previously said a judge ‘should’ treat everyone fairly and respectfully, ‘without regard to a person’s race, gender, or other protected personal characteristic.’ The new one, which goes into effect Jan. 1, says a judge must perform their duties ‘without bias or prejudice.’ It changes ‘should’ to ‘shall,’ and says they ‘shall not intentionally or recklessly, in the performance of judicial duties, manifest bias or prejudice’.” Read more here.

#4 “What Ethics Rules Say On Atty Discipline For Online Speech.” From the Law360: “Though law firms are free to discipline employees for their online commentary about Charlie Kirk or other social media activity, saying crude or insensitive things on the internet generally doesn’t subject attorneys to professional discipline under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, says Stacie H. Rosenzweig at Halling & Cayo.” Read more here.

#5 “Ethics Opinion 1286: Requesting Former Clients to Write Google Reviews.” From the New York State Bar Association: “A lawyer may ask a former client to write a Google review of the lawyer’s services, and may offer the former client a nominal gift for doing so, provided the lawyer does not draft the Google review for the client or condition the gift on the content of the review. The lawyer may not use the former client’s confidential information to the disadvantage of the former client.” Read more here.

# 6 “Supreme Court Ethics Issues Trace to John Roberts’ ‘Original Sin,’ New Book Alleges.” From the Rolling Stone: “When he was pitching himself to George W. Bush for a seat on the highest court in the land, John Roberts famously declared that judges should be like ‘umpires,’ making calls but never stepping up to the plate for either team. Bush liked the line so much he didn’t just give Roberts a seat on the Supreme Court, he installed him as chief justice — the youngest person to hold that job in almost 200 years. A new book, Without Precedent — an excerpt of which has been shared exclusively with Rolling Stone — suggests another powerful reason why Bush may have felt such extraordinary confidence appointing Roberts to the most powerful position in the U.S. judiciary. At the time that Roberts was auditioning for the job, he was also presiding over a critical case to which the Bush administration was a party — and rather than acting as an ump in that case, author Lisa Graves suggests, Roberts was practically pinch-hitting for Bush and his cronies.” Read more here.

#7 “Using Military Lawyers as Immigration Judges is Ill-Advised and Potentially Illegal.” From the Brennan Center for Justice: “The Trump administration’s reported authorization of 600 military lawyers to act as temporary immigration judges would deprive immigrants of a fair hearing and further erode the line between the military and civilian government. This is true regardless of the professionalism of the military lawyers. Immigration judges are specially trained administrative judges in the Department of Justice who oversee deportation hearings. … In addition, ethical rules are fundamental to the rule of law, but the legal and ethical obligations of military lawyers and immigration judges are in tension.” Read more here.

#8 “Update to ‘Conflict U.’: Some Judges Are Recusing Due to a University Conflict.” From Fix the Court: “In July, Fix the Court released a report called Conflict U. that identified 24 federal judges who did not recuse in six dozen cases involving the universities where they also serve as law school instructors. This practice raises clear conflict-of-interest concerns, despite being sanctioned by judiciary policy. The report urges reforms to strengthen recusal practices and restore public trust in judicial ethics. This past month, Fix the Court conducted follow-up research on this issue, and what we found was somewhat surprising: several judges with adjunct positions at law schools are, in fact, choosing to recuse when the law schools’ parent universities find themselves in their courtrooms.” Read more here.

#9 “Law, Layers and the Battle Against Antisemitism.” From Eli Wald (Denver) in JOTWELL reviewing Antisemitism and the Law by Robert Katz: “According to the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer is ‘a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice. As Deborah Rhode has astutely pointed out, however, lawyers’ duties as public citizens have long been more of a rhetorical ploy than an actual commitment, in need of elaboration and exposition. In the twenty-first century, lawyers have been forced to come to terms with their asserted role as public citizens in the face of the #MeToo and the Black Lives Matter movements, reform calls for the deregulation of the legal profession designed to increase access to legal services for those who cannot afford to pay for them, and attacks on the rule of law. Professor Robert Katz’ new casebook, Antisemitism and the Law, constitutes an important contribution sure to help those aiming to understand the obligations of lawyers to pursue justice and combat discrimination.” Read more here.

#10 “Dealing with Social Media & Public Comment: Legal Ethics Lessons for Corporate Counsel.” From JD Supra: “Social media can turn small moments into corporate crises overnight. For in-house counsel, the ethical challenges are particularly complex: protecting confidential information, addressing employee conduct, and managing public backlash when private behavior goes viral. … The Oklahoma and Texas Rules of Professional Conduct frame the lawyer’s obligations when social media collides with the workplace.” Read more here.

“Legal Insurance and Its Limits” by Nora Freeman Engstrom (Stanford). From the abstract:

Courts are buckling under the weight of a staggering access-to-justice crisis. In three-quarters of cases, at least one side lacks a lawyer, default judgments are on the rise, and most Americans with valid claims never take legal action. The situation is dire, and it understandably has policymakers casting about for a fix. On the menu are a range of uncontroversial reform ideas, such as expanding legal aid, supporting system simplification, and promoting pro bono. But it is increasingly clear that those measures—even if accomplished—would not make a dent in the problem. Attention is thus turning to other reform ideas, such as relaxing unauthorized practice of law (UPL) rules and scrapping Model Rule 5.4(d), the provision that prevents nonlawyers from even partially owning entities that deliver legal services. Both reforms are promising. But both would dilute the longstanding lawyers’ monopoly. Perhaps not surprisingly, the bar is fighting these reforms tooth-and-nail.

Into this roiling landscape, some now have a new idea: legal insurance. They suggest that legal insurance is the way to expand access to justice for middle and working-class Americans. Reformers are also quick to point out that—unlike a relaxation of UPL restrictions or the abolition of Rule 5.4(d)—legal insurance stands to benefit lawyers.

We have seen this play before. In the 1970s, the bar seized on legal insurance as a solution to what was then seen as an urgent access-to-justice crisis afflicting the middle-class. … This Article recovers the lost history of the country’s first experiment with legal insurance. In so doing, it seeks to forestall another false start. In addition, by drawing on a range of disciplines—including insurance law (particularly insights concerning moral hazard and adverse selection), behavioral economics, legal ethics, and the legal profession—this Article explains why the legal insurance idea floundered, and seems destined to flounder, going forward.

“Interoperable Legal AI for Access to Justice” by Drew Simshaw (UNLV). From the abstract:

The access-to-justice gap is growing, affecting individuals with both civil and criminal needs in the United States. Though these challenges are multifaceted, procedural barriers in the U.S. legal system can often inhibit access-to-justice efforts. The resulting inequities undermine fairness for those interacting with courts and jeopardize the legitimacy of the broader legal system. Legal technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its potential to combat these challenges on three access-to-justice fronts that are often conceptualized in isolation: a consumer (i.e., self-help) front, a legal-service-provider front, and a court front. Progress on each of these fronts is apparent, though not at the pace or scale necessary to make meaningful inroads into closing the justice gap nationwide. The time has come to appreciate that, although progress on all three fronts is necessary for closing the justice gap and maximizing fairness, it is insufficient if there is not also some level of shared commitment and coordination across – and not just within – all fronts. This Essay argues that technological and procedural legal interoperability – that is, widespread consistency in technology design and related processes – should be at the forefront of these efforts, particularly as they relate to artificial intelligence. Further, although the consumer and legal-services fronts remain critically important, courts should be recognized as the necessary drivers in achieving this interoperable legal AI.

PITTSBURGH, PA – OCTOBER 6, 2025 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Federal Law Enforcement, Congresswoman Shontel Brown (OH-11), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) led a letter raising urgent concerns over reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has activated a contract with Paragon Solutions, a foreign spyware company whose surveillance product ""Graphite"" has the ability to covertly access private data on Americans’ cell phones without their knowledge or consent.

In the letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers warn that ICE’s potential use of Graphite, which employs “zero-click” exploits to access encrypted messages, photos, and real-time location data, poses a serious threat to civil liberties, privacy, and constitutional protections—all of which have been undermined under the Trump Administration.

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote.

The letter references alarming reports that Paragon spyware has already been used to target journalists and human rights advocates in Europe. It also invokes Supreme Court rulings — Riley v. California (2014) and Carpenter v. United States (2018) — which affirmed the need for a warrant before law enforcement can access cell phone content or location data.

In light of potential constitutional violations, the Members are demanding transparency and oversight. Specifically, they are requesting:

All communications and documents discussing ICE’s use of spyware, including but not limited to Paragon Solutions software like Graphite;

All communications and documents regarding the legality of and legal justification for using spyware or mass electronic surveillance for immigration enforcement;

A comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE’s strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States; and

All communications and documents regarding the legality of using spyware against individuals residing within the United States given Executive Order 14093.

“Allowing ICE access to spyware that can be used to easily track and monitor the public—including those vocally opposed to governmental overreach— threatens Americans’ freedom of movement and freedom of speech...[and] raises serious questions about whether ICE will respect Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure for people residing in the U.S,” the letter concludes.

The Members of Congress are seeking a full response from DHS by October 14, 2025.

This is the second batch of deportees that the Trump administration has sent to Eswatini as part of its hard-line approach towards immigration.

The 10 have been ""securely accommodated"", and posed no threat to the public, Eswatini's prison department said in a statement.

Eswatini human rights lawyer Mzwandile Masuku told the BBC he was ""shocked and dismayed"" that the government had taken in the group, despite an ongoing court case against the arrival of five deportees in July.

The US had described the five - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as ""depraved monsters"".

The Jamaican has since been repatriated to his country of origin, while another two were expected to be repatriated soon, Eswatini's government says.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would take in 11 deportees following an agreement with the US ""to cooperate in this manner"".

It did not explain why only 10 had arrived.

Their names have not been made public.

Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks out

Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent

The BBC reported in September that the Trump administration had told Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the centre of a long-running immigration row, he could be deported to the southern African kingdom.

The administration alleges that he was a member of a transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then returned to the US where he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He pleaded not guilty.

A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for ""vindictive"" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision.

The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported.

In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a ""secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin"".

Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane.

Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected the government to ""respect the court process and await its ruling"" before accepting more deportees.

In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments.

It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its ""border and migration management capacity"", HRW said.

The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to ""executive over-reach"" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance.

Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.

The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of ""democratic regression"", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.

""We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,"" the SALC's Melusi Simelane told the BBC.

The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.

Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at ""top clearance level"".

The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border.

Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area.
Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement.
A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities’ restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE — a 10-fold increase in its current budget — as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress’ failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration’s top priority, is still flush with cash.

Millions spent on the 30-second ads

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,” according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city’s mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

Local police can’t compete with ICE promises

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city’s Police Officers Association, said he’d seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city’s police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.”

The government shutdown could dampen ICE’s recruitment hopes, he said.

“They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,” he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it’s too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city’s recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It’s the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who’s in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That’s all this is, strengthening the belief that they’re doing something.”

The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.

JB Pritzker said Sunday night.

The Democrat blasted Trump’s “invasion” hours after the president mobilized 300 California National Guard members to Portland, where unrest has raged for over 100 consecutive days outside an immigration detention center — a scene that has been playing out in Chicago since September.

Pritzker said the plan defies his wishes, adding that federal officials haven’t reached out to coordinate or discuss the deployment.

“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” the governor said in a post on X, encouraging “every American to speak up and help stop this madness.”

“It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will not involve sending in another state’s military troops. I call on [Texas] Governor [Greg] Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for this decision and refuse to coordinate.”

Pritzker condemned Trump for wanting to send active-duty troops to a “sovereign state” without permission, accusing the president of using the National Guard as “political props.”

The White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

A violent wave of anti-ICE protests has intensified in the Windy City since US Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” an initiative aimed at targeting criminal illegal immigrants who feds say flocked to Chicago to seek protection under the state’s “sanctuary policies.”

The immigration enforcement operation has drawn pushback from Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other prominent local Democrats.

But despite their objections, demonstrations have escalated in recent days, with protesters using vehicles to attack ICE agents in the Chicago area, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said agents were targeted twice in such a manner one day earlier this week.

US Border Patrol agents patrolling Chicago’s South Side on Saturday also opened fire and wounded a woman — later found to be armed — after an angry mob attempted to attack the federal officers.

The agents were located about 15 miles from an ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, a site that’s been a hotbed of civil unrest, when the ambush began.

More than a dozen protesters have been arrested near the ICE facility since Friday, according to Fox News.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem — who touched down in Illinois Friday morning — called Chicago a “war zone” during an interview Sunday with “Fox & Friends Weekend.”

Noem also alleged that Chicago has been blocking federal law enforcement, including Border Patrol and ICE officers, from using public restrooms in the city.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Illinois.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:04.453590

Caveat: Researchers also warn that ICE data is typically incomplete, suggesting there could be an undercount of solitary confinement placements.
Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas, had the second-highest (1,075), followed by Buffalo Service Processing Center (642) in Batavia, New York, and South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Texas (488).
Solitary confinement is not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but violates U.S. and international law.
Yes, but: Prisoner advocates say ""administrative segregation"" is just a euphemism for solitary confinement, and that the differences are minimal.","The researchers focused on immigrant detention centers, which experts say are primarily used to hold immigrants and ensure they make their court hearings and check-ins — not to punish them for immigration violations.

Driving the news: Nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers nationwide between April 2024 and August 2025, per new data provided exclusively to Axios.

Researchers detailed an increase in solitary confinement placements and, for some populations, weeks-long isolation periods, in a recent report that focused on data between April 2024 and May 2025.

The report, which relies on ICE's data collections, didn't show the duration of solitary confinement placements for all detainees, just for those labeled as ""vulnerable,"" like those with mental health issues.

Zoom in: Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" who make up one-fifth of detainees between April 2024 and May, were placed in solitary confinement for an average of 38 days in the first three months of 2025.

In 2021, the average duration was 14 days, per the report.

ICE's own directives suggest using solitary confinement on people with mental health conditions only as a last resort.

This often happened in state and county jails contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold detainees.

Caveat: Researchers also warn that ICE data is typically incomplete, suggesting there could be an undercount of solitary confinement placements.

By the numbers: The report found that Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, had the highest number of people isolated (1,905) through May.

Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas, had the second-highest (1,075), followed by Buffalo Service Processing Center (642) in Batavia, New York, and South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Texas (488).

What they're saying: ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" says Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that uses medicine to advocate against human rights violations.

Solitary confinement is not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but violates U.S. and international law.

ICE didn't respond to several emails from Axios seeking comment.

The other side: Some jails and prisons, like in Massachusetts, say they have shifted away from solitary confinement and instead practice ""administrative segregation,"" which involves separating detainees believed to pose a threat to safety, property or correctional operations.

Massachusetts officials say segregated detainees regularly interact with staff clinicians and sometimes inmates, and that they have daily access to mental health clinicians.

Yes, but: Prisoner advocates say ""administrative segregation"" is just a euphemism for solitary confinement, and that the differences are minimal.

What's next: The report urged state and local officials to use their own power to end or reduce the use of solitary confinement in local facilities with ICE contracts.

The report also suggested unplanned facility inspections by local officials and steps to ensure detainees have legal representation, interpreters and due process protections.

The bottom line: ""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people, and these are people who are not imprisoned for criminal activity,"" Zarifi said.",https://images.axios.com/kLIrmxNB88IRcHKWScYhfUNbOLk=/0x9:1300x740/1366x768/2025/10/06/1759756539443.png,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:50.402810

But Immergut, the Oregon judge, ruled Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” enough to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard.
In an interview with CalMatters, Voss said the order specifically blocked Hegseth’s federalization of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard — it wasn’t a restraining order on all National Guard deployments.
The 300 California National Guard troops Trump is deploying to Oregon are a holdover from his June activation.
After most of the 4,700 troops left Los Angeles, Trump in August ordered 300 California National Guard troops to remain deployed in Southern California.","Hours after California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against the Trump administration Sunday seeking to prevent the president from sending 300 California National guard troops to Portland, Ore., a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order blocking federalized deployment from any state to Oregon.

The order came during an extraordinary Sunday night hearing after Oregon and California attorneys revealed that in addition to trying to send California troops to Oregon, President Trump’s War Secretary, Pete Hegseth, had ordered Texas National Guard members to deploy as well.

Oregon District Court Judge Karin Immergut interrupted Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton repeatedly during the hearing, saying the administration was trying to circumvent an order she issued Saturday temporarily halting the use of Oregon Guard troops in Portland.

She said that she sees the conduct of the Trump administration, and its federalization of 400 Texas National Guard troops, as a “direct contravention of the order that this court issued yesterday.” The Texas National Guard was also slated for Chicago and other locations, a legal document said.

At another point in the hearing she asked, “aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order, which relies on the conditions in Portland, and nothing has changed? Another point in the hearing. “So why is this appropriate?”

Hamilton, a deputy assistant attorney general, argued that the White House was authorized to send in the California National Guard, despite Immergut’s Saturday order, because the California troops were called up under a different Trump memo in June. Immergut dismissed that line of reasoning. “Mr. Hamilton, you are missing the point, because here it’s the conditions on the ground in Oregon that was a basis for my finding” yesterday. And those conditions haven’t changed.

After the 30-minute hearing, which was delayed nearly an hour for technical reasons, Bonta issued a statement applauding Immergut’s ruling.

“The President’s move to deploy the National Guard of one state over the objections of a Governor to another state over the objections of a second is well outside of the norms or practices of any President in recent history.” Bonta wrote. “This fight isn’t over, but today’s rebuke of the President’s illegal actions is a step in the right direction.” This was California 42nd suit against Trump in 36 weeks.

Stephen Miller, a senior White House advisor, condemned the judge’s decision Sunday in a social media post. “A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property.” Federal appeals court judges, including those appointed by Trump, disagree and have ruled that they can review a president’s decisions, but with deference.

He also called the ruling “one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen — and is yet the latest example of unceasing efforts to nullify the 2024 election by fiat.”

On Saturday, Immergut temporarily blocked the administration from activating a contingent of the Oregon National Guard to combat what President Donald Trump calls lawless behavior emanating from immigration protests in Portland.

Hegseth responded by calling in California troops. As of Sunday evening, 100 California Guard members had already arrived in Portland.

“The stakes could not be higher,” Bonta said before Sunday’s hearing. “People should understand clearly what is happening here: The president is seeking to deploy the California National Guard as federal military police indefinitely anywhere in the country. He’s not even hiding the ball.”

He and legal representatives for Portland and Oregon sought a temporary halt to the deployment of California troops.

Bonta’s messaging echoes Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said in a statement Sunday morning that: “we will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States.”

By Sunday morning 100 California National Guard troops arrived in Portland by plane from Los Angeles, the amended suit says. Hegseth intends to send another 200 California National Guard troops soon, Bonta added.

Trump has characterized Portland and other Democratic-run cities as dangerous, high-crime zones and last week told a gathering of U.S. generals that the military should “use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

Trump’s moves are ‘unique’

In the suit filed Sunday evening, lawyers for California and Oregon argue that the White House is again failing to meet the standards of the federal law that would permit Hegseth to federalize any National Guard troops — Title 10, Section 12406.

It also says that the initial reason for federalizing the California National Guard to Los Angeles is “wholly unrelated” to the Trump administration’s goals in Portland.

Bonta expressed dismay over the shifting reasons to deploy California’s troops. The White House does “not have the carte blanche … to deploy whatever military they want, whenever they want,” he said at the press conference.

The suit also argues that the Trump White House is violating a 19th century federal law prohibiting federal troops from acting as law enforcement.

The dynamic is highly unusual, in no small part because Trump is essentially pulling troops from one state that has opposed his use of the National Guard to another state where political leaders also reject Trump’s moves.

“I don’t think we’ve seen this scenario before, I think it is unique,” Bonta said.

Trump claims he must deploy federalized troops because Portland is under siege by protesters opposing the administration’s immigration enforcement actions.

But Immergut, the Oregon judge, ruled Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” enough to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard. Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued her decision as part of a temporary restraining order against the federal government after Oregon and city of Portland sued the administration last week.

Protesters there set up “a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials” while others flashed bright lights into the eyes of federal officials driving, Immergut summarized. “These incidents are inexcusable, but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces,” Immergut wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.”

The Trump administration on Saturday appealed that decision to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

What’s likely new

Immergut’s order over the weekend was narrow, said Loren Voss, a fellow at the legal affairs publication Lawfare who’s taught classes on domestic deployment of the military. In an interview with CalMatters, Voss said the order specifically blocked Hegseth’s federalization of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard — it wasn’t a restraining order on all National Guard deployments.

“But one of their (Oregon’s) big arguments, and one that judge Immergut found persuasive, was a diversion of their National Guard members from state responsibilities, right, which would not apply here,” Voss said.

She expects several overlapping legal proceedings to unfold. In addition to Newsom’s vow to sue, the Ninth Circuit may weigh in shortly on Immergut’s Saturday decision in response to the Trump administration’s emergency appeal, which could shape how future legal challenges unfold.

Voss noted that Trump federalized the California National Guard because of protests in Los Angeles, but now they’re being assigned to duties in Portland for a different purpose. “This is an interesting legal question,” she said. “I think there is a good challenge that can be made there.”

Trump sent thousands of troops into L.A.

California sued Trump in June after the president federalized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops and 700 Marines to protect federal property and provide support for federal immigration law enforcement officers after protests across Los Angeles County erupted over immigration sweeps.

A district judge, appointed by President Bill Clinton, sided with Newsom by issuing a temporary restraining order against Trump’s use of the National Guard in June. But a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit blocked that decision, giving Trump control of the federal troops again.

The 300 California National Guard troops Trump is deploying to Oregon are a holdover from his June activation. After most of the 4,700 troops left Los Angeles, Trump in August ordered 300 California National Guard troops to remain deployed in Southern California. Those are the troops Hegseth is sending to Oregon. Bonta had already sued to stop that extended deployment before Sunday’s suit.

The Oregon judge’s decision doesn’t conflict with the higher court’s reasons for returning the federal troops to Trump, said Kelly Simon, a legal director at the ACLU of Oregon, during a press conference.

The appeals court said judges can review such military decisions, rejecting an argument by Trump administration lawyers. And while the “courts have to give a substantial deference” to a president’s decision to deploy National Guard troops to a state against the wishes of a governor, the White House still has to make that “determination rooted in fact,” Simon said. “The president’s determination was untethered from the facts.”

The California federal lower court judge also ruled in September that federal troops were used for law enforcement purposes, a violation of a 19th-century law banning the military from such activity.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Judge Charles Breyer. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”

He blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the Trump administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-27.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:53.480657

Courts Find That Public Policy Does Not Prohibit Coverage for TVPRA Claims Many states prohibit insurance coverage for criminal acts or intentionally inflicted injuries on public policy grounds.
Insurers have sought to extend these public policy prohibitions to human trafficking claims.
Liberty Mutual raised the issue of intent in arguing that public policy precludes coverage for the Red Roof Inn defendants, pointing to Georgia law that states it is against public policy to insure against injuries intentionally inflicted.","Increasingly, many companies are finding themselves entangled in human trafficking claims under federal and state laws. The federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and similar state laws cast a wide net that is intended to snare those involved in or those that ""knowingly benefit"" from trafficking. Industries such as agriculture, construction, transportation, technology, banking, hospitality, and others are vulnerable to trafficking claims.

In addition to ""perpetrator liability"" for those directly involved in trafficking, the TVPRA allows victims to pursue civil claims against individuals and entities that benefit from the trafficking. To assert a claim for ""beneficiary liability,"" a plaintiff must allege, and ultimately prove, (1) the defendant knowingly benefitted from (2) participation in a venture (3) that it knew or should have known engaged in trafficking, including forced labor and sex trafficking. Recent examples include:

Filipino migrant workers alleging forced labor and violations of the TVPRA sued CH2M Hill International, Jacob Engineering Group, and related companies that worked with the Qatari government to construct soccer stadiums and facilities as part of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank faced civil lawsuits from victims of Jeffrey Epstein for their alleged role in facilitating and profiting from the trafficking.

com, Inc. faces multiple TVPRA lawsuits alleging that it assisted, supported, and facilitated sex trafficking by selling its software tools and providing operational support to Backpage.com.

According to the Human Trafficking Legal Center, the number of TVPRA filings has increased from six in 2004 to 280 in 2024. Unsurprisingly, the increase in TVPRA civil claims has led to an increase in disputes over insurance coverage for such claims.

Two recent decisions add to a growing number of courts concluding that TVPRA claims may trigger coverage under Coverage A (bodily injury and property damage) and/or Coverage B (personal and advertising injury) of a commercial general liability (CGL) policy. In both cases, the court rejected the insurers' arguments that (1) policy exclusions precluded coverage and/or (2) public policy barred coverage.

Courts Find That TVPRA Allegations Trigger Coverage

In Peerless Indemnity Insurance Company, et. al. v. Tilma, Inc., No. 24-492 (U.S.D.C. E.D. VA July 22, 2025), the court dismissed the insurers' lawsuit seeking a declaration that the insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify an insured alleged to have violated the TVPRA. The court concluded that the insurers had a duty to defend and indemnify the insured in the underlying trafficking lawsuit ""because the Policy unambiguously covers the conduct alleged against [the insured]."" Id. at 6. In the underlying lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged she was trafficked, her traffickers used the insured's hotel for their crimes, and that the insured turned a blind eye to the trafficking.

The Peerless court found that Coverage B encompassed the alleged conduct. Like standard CGL policies, the policy at issue in Peerless provided coverage for ""personal and advertising injuries,"" including injuries ""arising out of … false arrest, detention, or imprisonment."" Id. at 7. The Peerless court explained that the underlying complaint alleged the insured ""knew or should have known that [the victim] was being detained"" and that employees ""overheard [the victim] screaming while her trafficker caught her, dragged her back to her hotel room, and beat her following her attempt to escape her trafficker."" Id. The court properly concluded that the complaint's ""know or should have known"" language sounded in negligence, and the allegations alleged detention as defined under Virginia law. Therefore, the complaint alleged ""personal and advertising injury"" covered under the policy.

In Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., et. al., No. 23-02047 (U.S.D.C. N.D. Georgia August 15, 2025), the court concluded that ""Georgia law requires a finding that Plaintiff has a duty to defend the Red Roof Defendants"" in the underlying lawsuit under Coverage A of the policy. Liberty Mutual argued the underlying allegations did not trigger coverage because there were no allegations of ""bodily injury"" caused by an ""occurrence."" Liberty Mutual predicated its position on the definition of ""occurrence"" defined in the policy as ""an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions."" Liberty Mutual pointed to allegations of the insureds' active and intentional participation in the trafficking scheme, arguing that such intentional conduct could not be accidental. The Red Roof Inn defendants, however, argued that whether an event is an accident must be determined from the viewpoint of the insured and whether the insured's conduct was designed to injure the victim. Stated another way, the alleged injury would only not satisfy the ""occurrence"" definition if the insured subjectively intended or expected to cause specific injury to the plaintiff.

The court agreed with the Red Roof Inn defendants, noting that, while the complaint did include allegations of intentional conduct, the complaint also included allegations that the insureds ""should have known"" of the trafficking. The court correctly held that such ""constructive knowledge language sounds in negligence and implies that the Red Roof Defendants did not have the requisite intent to cause [the victim's] alleged bodily injuries."" Id. at 13. The court cited to Georgia law, reasoning that an insurer has a duty to defend if the facts as alleged ""even arguably bring the occurrence with the policy's coverage."" Id. And, because the insureds ""were alleged to be negligent in regard to the TVPRA violations, the Court finds that [Plaintiff's] complaint is arguably covered by the ‘bodily injury from an occurrence' provision of Coverage A.""

Courts Find That Policy Exclusions Do Not Preclude Coverage

Having concluded the allegations triggered coverage, both courts turned to the policy exclusions the insurers argued precluded coverage. Both courts properly found the exclusions inapplicable by focusing on the allegations and conduct of the insured as opposed to those of the traffickers.

In the Peerless matter, the insurer argued that an exclusion precluding coverage for ""personal and advertising injuries caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict personal and advertising injury"" applied. The court disagreed because the underlying complaint did not allege the insured itself sexually trafficked the victim or directed her traffickers to commit their intentional tort. Instead, the complaint alleged the insured's lack of action or lack of knowledge of the trafficking made it liable and such allegations do not ""equate to ‘causing or directing' actions with the knowledge that those actions would violate the rights of"" the victim. Similarly, an exclusion for injuries ""arising out of a criminal act committed by or at the direction of the insured"" was inapplicable because there were no allegations that the insured committed or directed the criminal conduct.

Likewise, the Liberty Mutual court rejected the argument that the Expected or Intended Injury Exclusion, which bars coverage for bodily injury ""expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,"" applied. In analyzing the exclusion, the court noted it must narrowly and strictly construe the provision against the insurer under Georgia law. Given the ""know or should have known"" allegations, the court found that at least some of the allegations did not allege the insureds acted with the intent or expectation of causing bodily injury and, thus, the exclusion did not unambiguously preclude coverage.

Courts Find That Public Policy Does Not Prohibit Coverage for TVPRA Claims

Many states prohibit insurance coverage for criminal acts or intentionally inflicted injuries on public policy grounds. Insurers have sought to extend these public policy prohibitions to human trafficking claims. At least one federal district court did just that, concluding that Pennsylvania's public policy bars coverage for those involved in allegedly enabling or profiting from human trafficking. In Samsung Fire & Marine Ins., Co., (U.S. Branch) v. UFVS Mgmt. Co., LLC, No. CV 18-04365 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2023), the court relied on Pennsylvania's anti-trafficking law, which criminalizes (1) harboring or maintaining a person with reckless disregard to the fact that they will be subject to sex trafficking and (2) knowingly benefitting from such trafficking as evidence of Pennsylvania's overriding public policy against sex trafficking. According to the court, the allegations against the insureds exposed them to independent criminal liability.

On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that deciding the issue would require weighing Pennsylvania's strong presumption of insurance coverage against Pennsylvania's public policy against sex trafficking and, because the court could not predict how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would rule, it certified the issue to the Supreme Court. Samsung Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (U.S. Branch) v. RI Settlement Tr., No. 23-1988 (3d Cir. Aug. 12, 2024). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted certification, and the case remains pending.

Beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, however, is not limited to criminal conduct and, for defendants that purportedly knowingly benefit from trafficking, plaintiffs often allege conduct that falls short of criminal as demonstrated in the Peerless matter. After ruling that the criminal act exclusion did not apply, the Peerless court addressed the insurers' argument that Virginia public policy prohibits coverage for criminal acts prohibited by the TVPRA. In rejecting this argument, the court explained that Virginia courts prohibit coverage only in cases where the insured acts with specific intent to cause harm. The court further explained that beneficiary liability under the TVPRA does not require specific intent on the part of a beneficiary and there were no such allegations in the underlying complaint.

Liberty Mutual raised the issue of intent in arguing that public policy precludes coverage for the Red Roof Inn defendants, pointing to Georgia law that states it is against public policy to insure against injuries intentionally inflicted. According to Liberty Mutual, because the Red Roof Inn defendants participated in the sex trafficking venture where injuries are often intentionally inflicted, it goes against public policy to provide coverage. The Liberty Mutual court rejected this argument, explaining that ""Georgia's public policy exclusion focuses on whether the injuries were intentionally inflicted, not simply whether the conduct was intentional,"" and there were no allegations that the insureds (as opposed to the traffickers) intended to injure the victims. Additionally, the Liberty Mutual court recognized that the TVPRA does not have a scienter requirement, nor does it require a showing of injurious intent.

The Peerless and Liberty Mutual decisions add to the growing body of case law concluding that TVPRA claims trigger coverage under CGL policies under Coverages A and B, of course depending on the specific allegations and policy language. The decisions also reinforce well-established principles of insurance law, including (1) insurers have a broad duty to defend; (2) exclusionary language must be narrowly and strictly construed against the insurer; and (3) intentional act exclusions focus on the subjective intent of the insured, not the intentional acts of others. Importantly, both courts also recognized that TVPRA beneficiary liability does not require specific intent on the part of the alleged beneficiary, making reliance on public policy difficult where there are allegations the alleged beneficiary acted negligently i.e., ""knew or should have known"" of the trafficking.

In sum, companies are increasingly targets of beneficiary liability claims under the TVPRA and should understand and evaluate the potential risk such lawsuits pose, including what insurance coverage may be available.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7704_2141.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:58.533085

There are two fundamental principles each member of the military learns when he or she takes the oath of office: first, that superior orders are presumed to be lawful and must be scrupulously obeyed; and, second, that if there is ever a conflict between orders and the law, the law prevails. Over the past year, these principles have come into sharp focus. America’s military personnel – volunteers all – are increasingly alert to the prospect that they may be asked to prioritize loyalty to an individual over their rights and responsibilities under the law.

In 2024, the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that a president is absolutely immune from prosecution for acts within the scope of his core constitutional authority. In the military context, what this could mean is that the other branches of government – Congress and the Judiciary – may not make or enforce any law that would make him criminally liable for any act performed, decision made, or order given in his capacity as commander-in-chief. Although the contours of the Supreme Court’s decision have yet to be fully tested or defined, what is already clear is that – impeachment aside – it effectively places a president above the law and eliminates any legal incentive for him to exercise restraint. This becomes even more dangerous when, as now, a president is ineligible for re-election, since the ballot box does not serve as a check.

The Supreme Court majority’s rationale was that if a president is subject to prosecution for exercising his exclusive constitutional authority – authority widely understood to include at least some aspects of his role as commander-in-chief – he might be “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties.” In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered a couple of military examples – “nightmare scenarios” such as staging a military coup or ordering SEAL Team Six to execute a political rival – to illustrate her conviction that, as a result of the majority’s decision, “the President is now a king above the law.”

The majority focused on the president’s authority and prerogatives; the dissenters focused on the potential havoc an unrestrained president might wreak. It’s understandable that no one examined the impact of this decision on military personnel who might be ordered to carry out orders for which a president can no longer be held accountable. Understandable because, other than Justice Samuel Alito (who served on active duty in the Army for three months following his law school graduation) no Justice has any military experience. Unfortunately, by failing to consider the impact of its decision on the military, the Court placed the entire burden of dealing with an unbounded commander-in-chief upon those serving in uniform and other federal employees who are subject to his orders.

When Is an Order Unlawful?

Following the reelection of Donald Trump, much has been written about the military’s obligation to obey lawful orders and right to disobey unlawful orders. Some have engaged in the academic exercise of drawing lines between lawful and unlawful orders. Others have suggested that military leaders standing firm against this president’s autocratic tendencies may be American democracy’s last hope. Few commentators have considered how Trump v. United States has changed the distinction between lawful and unlawful orders. Before the Supreme Court’ s decision, an order to kill unarmed civilians would have universally been considered an unlawful order. Think: My Lai Massacre, when hundreds of civilians were murdered by U.S. soldiers in Vietnam in 1968. Today, that conclusion is far less certain. Why?

First, although most scholars believe limiting the president’s criminal accountability has no effect on the prosecution of military personnel who violate the law pursuant to his orders, the case left a door open to the notion that absolute immunity might also extend to the president’s agents. If the Court is truly concerned that a president subject to criminal prosecution might be “unduly cautious,” why limit absolute immunity to him? If the Court wants to facilitate bold action, limiting immunity to him alone could mean that bold action will never extend beyond the Oval Office door.

Next, we must always remember that the president has the power to pardon anyone who violates federal criminal law, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During his first administration, Trump pardoned or granted clemency to military members accused or convicted of war crimes. Given that track record, it’s likely that he would pardon anyone who commits a military offense pursuant to his orders.

Finally, if criminal law doesn’t apply to the president when he exercises his core constitutional authority, it is no wonder that some in uniform might question: can any order he issues to the military be considered “unlawful?” To make matters even more confusing, shortly after his second inauguration, Trump seized the opportunity to fill this Court-created legal void by issuing an executive order stating that only the “President and the Attorney General … shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch.” In other words, for the armed forces, the law is what Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi say it is.

Americans who cling to the hope that the military will constrain the president’s excesses by disobeying his unlawful orders must recognize that in addition to the confused legal landscape, U.S. military personnel face an unprecedented tsunami of executive actions intended and designed to secure absolute and unquestioning military obedience. Hegseth’s admonition to America’s senior military leaders at Quantico to “do the honorable thing and resign” if his words made their “heart[s] sink,” made it clear that any act of what he considers disloyalty or dissent will be crushed.

Firing the Judge Advocates General of the Army and Air Force was a signal to the armed forces that the law will no longer constrain military operations. Sending 600 JAGs to serve as immigration judges will further thin the ranks of military attorneys available to help commanders and other affected personnel distinguish lawful from unlawful orders.

Targeting suspected “narcotrafficker” boats transiting between Venezuela and points north, reportedly killing 21 people to date, without a plausible legal justification has further eroded the idea that military operations must be conducted in lawful ways.

The subtext in these and many future military decisions, actions, and operations has been and will likely be: the law is what the president says it is.

The Law is Still the Law

If disobeying unlawful orders is no longer a clear legal option or predictable outcome, what is to be done?

First, every military leader, whether in attendance at the Quantico photo op or not, must understand that the law is still the law, even if the Court is willing to exempt the president from its consequences. Rather than maintaining a visible distance from their JAGs, who are increasingly being treated as irrelevant, commanders must proactively seek their legal advice.

For their part, JAGs must understand that the administration’s efforts to marginalize them has ironically underscored their importance. The only way the armed forces can continue to operate in a democratic society is if they understand what the law says and where it applies. If the law as it appears in the Constitution, statute, regulation, and judicial decisions conflicts with the law as the president has defined it or with orders issued in his name, JAGs need to identify, document, and report those conflicts. This is their duty as officers, attorneys, and citizens.

If commanders are ordered to engage in acts or operations affected by conflicting legal interpretations, they must first find a way to achieve stated objectives within the bounds of international and domestic law as commonly understood, not as the president has egregiously misinterpreted them. If that’s not possible, they must speak up, put their concerns in writing, and be willing to resign if necessary.

Lest any commanders or JAGs be lulled by the recent confusion over lawful and unlawful orders into believing that obeying orders commonly regarded as unlawful will be rewarded, not punished, they should understand that their careers, liberty, and honor are not the only ones at stake. The troops they lead are watching. Commanders and JAGs must model proper behavior, to include respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.

Finally, former and retired military leaders need to speak out. Understanding that retired regular officers remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, many will consider the risks too great. Those who do speak out do so for many reasons, not the least of which is their ongoing commitment to the current generation of leaders they have shaped and led. Speaking out professionally and respectfully is a proper way to support the generations of men and women who have succeeded us in uniform.

Our military is and must remain capable of lethality. But lethality and honor must coexist in a democratic society’s armed forces. Making that coexistence a reality today is as great a challenge as any our nation has faced.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2237900419.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:58:13.201876

President

Arab American Institute

If US President Donald Trump really wants to earn a Nobel Peace Prize, he’s going to need to do better than his 20-point “Comprehensive Plan to End Gaza’s Conflict.” While in his characteristic style of exaggeration, Mr. Trump called the release of his plan “one of the greatest days in human history,” poring over Arab, Israeli, and US press reveals that most analysts are not inclined to see it that way.

After reading commentaries by writers across the board what is most striking is how widely divergent their views are toward Mr. Trump’s effort. While a few in all three regions express hope that the plan represents a pathway to peace, there’s a significant group of Israelis, Arabs, and Americans who see it as flawed and dangerous, albeit for different reasons.

Israeli hardliners, for example, suggest that if Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan were implemented, it will inevitably lead to the creation of a Palestinian state that will pose a mortal threat to Israel’s security. Meanwhile, a sizable body of Arabs express the concern that, if followed, Trump’s plan will make Israel’s occupation permanent, resulting in the dissolution of the Palestinian cause. In fact, the only issues on which there is agreement are that the plan would stop the further devastation in Gaza and allow for the return of Israeli hostages and some Palestinian prisoners.

The reasons behind this wide range of interpretations about the plan’s intentions are many: the Arabs’ well-earned lack of trust in both Trump and Netanyahu; the belief of hardline ideological Israelis that Netanyahu will do whatever it takes to remain prime minister; the deliberate vagueness of most of the plan’s key points; and, especially galling for Palestinians, the fact that they were handed the plan as a fait accompli without having been asked to provide input and told to accept it or, as Mr. Trump put it, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.”

Of all of these factors, it’s the vagueness that is problematic for all sides. Israeli hardliners, for example, fret over the mention of an Israeli withdrawal, the presence of Arab peacekeepers, Palestinian police, and the possible return of the PA (which, in their minds, means a link between the West Bank and Gaza leading to a Palestinian state).

Palestinians, on the other hand, reading the document closely, see that none of these provisions are guaranteed. And while there is mention of a phased Israeli withdrawal, the plan provides for Israeli forces to remain in a security perimeter inside Gaza. For Palestinians this means a continuation of the two-decades-long stranglehold Israel has had over all access into and egress from Gaza. They see this plan as too focused on Israeli security, with little regard for justice and Palestinian security.

Another glaring problem is the lack of definition of terms and an enforcement mechanism that will ensure that the terms of the plan are implemented. What, for example, is the definition of the “technocratic apolitical Palestinian committee” that is to be created to run day-to-day operations in Gaza? Will its members be vetted by the Trump-led board? Will the Israelis be able to veto members? And, without any clarity on these points, will this committee be viewed as having legitimacy by Palestinians? And finally, without a defined neutral mechanism for enforcement, will the US allow Israel to act in Gaza as they have with regard to the ceasefires in Lebanon and Syria—where they act as the sole arbiter and enforcer of the agreements? (Their interpretation of ceasefire is apparently “you cease, while we continue to fire.”)

The plan mentions an economic development plan to attract foreign investment that is to be designed by experts who have helped “birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East” and a special economic zone with preferred tariffs. But one is hard pressed to understand the relevance of all of this to the plight and immediate needs of Palestinians, which must take precedence over fantasy cities of the future.

There is some detail provided with regard to Hamas members’ decommissioning their weapons, pledging to commit to peaceful coexistence, and the formation of an International Stabilization Force in Gaza. But what’s not clear is how this will be administered. And while our polls make clear that Palestinians in Gaza have had enough of this war and Hamas, they also express the desire to be governed by a national unity coalition of Palestinians, and want accountability for the crimes committed by the Israeli forces.

The bottom line is that far from being “one of the great days in human history,” the Trump plan is just a start. It may end the bombing and return those held captive, but in order to lead to peace, there must be a great deal more discussion that adds flesh to the bones of the plan. That will require openness and trust on all sides. That said, the following are essential.

First, Hamas should accept the Trump Plan, even while stating their concerns and objections. Continuing the conflict is (and has long been) a dead end. Hamas cannot and should not be the arbiter of the Palestinian future. Too many lives have been lost and many more shattered. The fighting must end. Second, Arabs and other nations must insist that Israelis be held accountable for the crimes they have committed. They can’t be brushed aside. Third, with a ceasefire agreed to by all sides, the massive influx of aid and support that Palestinians will require should commence. Fourth, working from the outline provided by the Trump plan, negotiations should begin, with serious Palestinian input at all levels to flesh out the details that can resolve unanswered questions. Fifth, if the president wants to earn his place in history, he must be willing to crack the whip requiring Israel to adhere to whatever terms are established. And finally, for this to be prize-worthy, the whip-cracking must also be applied to the West Bank and East Jerusalem—and not only with regard to annexation. If peace is to be achieved, settlement expansion, land confiscation, home demolitions, raids, and rampages by settlers must end. These behaviors have weakened the credibility of the PA, won greater support for Hamas, and prepared the ground for even greater conflict.

The Trump plan, with its focus on Israel’s security and vague assurances to Palestinians, succeeded in getting Netanyahu and Hamas on board, each side with their own reservations. If it is to lead to peace, there is hard work ahead.

As the U. S. Supreme Court starts its 2025-26 term Monday, Oct. 6, the justices will be deciding, among other matters, which litigants are entitled to bring suit, using the doctrine of standing to determine who’s in and who’s not.

The concept of legal standing is well-known to nearly all lawyers, and even to many lay people as well. It consists of the requirement that a litigant asserting a claim must have a sufficient, legally cognizable interest or stake in the outcome of a case to warrant proceeding with a lawsuit.

The U. S. Supreme Court is fond of using this device from time-to-time to avert ruling on the merits of a case, a tenet that Chief Justice Roberts occasionally espouses during oral argument and high court rulings.

A dozen recent cases provide a broad perspective on current and prospective standing suits.

Issue illustrated

An illustration of the standing issue during the court’s 2024-25 term was the granting of a Trump administration’s emergency appeal staying a lower court ruling ordering reinstatement of some 16,000 fired federal government probationary employees on grounds that posture of the nine nonprofit organizations bringing the suit was “insufficient to support [their] standing” in U.S. Office of Personnel Management v. American Federation of Government Employees, 145 S.Ct. 1914 (April 8, 2025) (per curiam).

But two months later the justices found standing for fuel manufacturers challenging a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency to the state of California allowing it to impose stringent restrictions on vehicle emissions.

The justices rejected another standing challenge in Diamond Alternative Energy LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency, 145 S.Ct. 2121 (June 20, 2025) on grounds that as “targets,” the fuel makers should not be “locked out” from contesting regulations that may impose harm upon them in the future. This was a decision in which the oral argument portended a ruling that fuel manufacturers have standing to challenge heightened California state regulation of emissions for vehicles and electric cars imposed under a Biden era waiver from lesser federal anti-pollution standards, a holdover case from the prior administration that the Trump administration somewhat surprisingly continued to defend, ostensibly to avoid a recent ruling giving greater latitude to judicial review of governmental-imposed restrictions.

The decision that drew a sharp dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that the court was exhibiting an obedience to “moneyed interests” rather than “ordinary citizens,” which she characterized as a continuation of the tribunal’s undue favoritism of “corporate interests.” Some observers scoffed at her concerns, noting that a couple of days earlier it was revealed that she has been paid nearly $3 million from a “moneyed” publisher for her autobiography “Lovely One: A Memoir.”

The ruling, however, might be moot as Congress has enacted a measure rescinding the EPA’s waiver-granting authority.

But standing, or lack of it, is a device occasionally invoked by the Supreme Court in declining to rule on the merits of cases, as it did last year in dodging and dismissing the challenge by a group of anti-abortion physicians to the accessibility of the mifepristone pill used by many women for induced abortions. FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 692 U.S. 367 (2024). That litigation has been revived, however, and is now pending in federal court in Texas as a trio of Republican state attorneys general have taken up the cudgel. Chief Justice Roberts is a frequent questioner at oral argument of the standing of claimants, although others occasionally chime in, too.

Minnesota matters

Those cases stem from a Federal judicial requirement in Article III of the Constitution that courts hear “Cases and Controversies” has been interpreted to incorporate the concept of legal standing. There is no similar provision in Minnesota law, but common law incorporates the same principle in matters arising in this state.

A pair of significant rulings by the Minnesota Supreme Court reached similar results, including one ruling earlier this year and a prior one last year regarding this doctrine.

Although arising in different contexts, the cases both centered on the subject of standing. One involved the restoration of voting rights to felons and the other concerned a collective bargaining issue for Minneapolis school teachers.

However, the outcomes were the same in both cases, with the Supreme Court dismissing the lawsuits based on lack of standing by taxpayers.

Ballot battle

A battle over the right of felons to cast ballots was resolved in favor of a Minnesota statute enacted in 2023 that restored voting rights to most felons after completion of their incarceration in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Hunt, 10 N.W.3d 163 (2024). In its first ruling of the year, the justices unanimously rebuffed a challenge to the law brought by a conservative-oriented advocacy group that frequently challenges voting rights issues.

In a unanimous decision, with two newly appointed jurists not participating, the court upheld the measure, Minn. Stat. § 201014, subd. 2a, entitled the Minnesota Re-Enfranchisement Act, which is estimated to apply to about 60,000 Minnesotans.

The lawsuit was brought by a group of three individual taxpayers and the association to which they belong, Minnesota Voters Alliance (MVA), which has contested a number of voting rights measures over the years, some successful.

This was not one of them because the Ramsey County District Court dismissed the lawsuit, and the Supreme Court, hearing the suit on an accelerated review bypassing the Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Natalie Hudson, affirmed the lower court determination.

Without addressing the merits, the court held that the claimants lacked standing as taxpayers because that indulgence only applies when a dispute is centered on expenditure of public funds.

Reviewing the history of taxpayer standing in Minnesota, the chief justice noted that “binding precedent on taxpayer standing is currently limited to issues of illegal expenditures.” Because the re-enfranchisement statute “does not contemplate government expenditures,” the concerns raised by the taxpayers “are incidental” to their claims for relief and, therefore, they lack standing. A contrary ruling would, the chief justice said, “render the limitations on taxpayer standing to become meaningless” by allowing unrestrained challenges to government actions that involve incidental expenditures, which are disallowed because a “taxpayer cannot manufacture standing by pointing to expenditures that are incidental to implementing the law.”

Because taxpayers lack standing, “it logically follows that their association … does not have associational standing.”

Another associational standing case was addressed this summer in Orono Oaks Volunteer Road Assoc. v. Orono Oaks Assoc., Inc., 2025 WL 2318221 (Minn. App. Aug. 11, 2025)(nonprecedential). The suit was brought by an association consisting of all homeowners in a subdivision that was established to address the failure of a nonprofit association tasked with maintenance of roads in the subdivision. The Hennepin County District Court dismissed the lawsuit for damages due to the neglected maintenance, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

The homeowner’s association bringing the case lacked standing since the claimed damages were “specific” to the individual property owner and cannot be pursued by the association, along with denying a request for a receivership.

Reimbursement ruling

A taxpayer challenge to a provision in a collective bargaining agreement between the union representing teachers in the Minneapolis public school system and the school district also faltered on grounds of lack of standing in Clapp v. Sayles Adams, 15 N.W.3d 648 (Minn. Jan. 8, 2025).

In its first ruling of this year, the court, again unanimously in a decision written by Justice Karl Procacinni, rejected the claim by a taxpayer who lived in Minneapolis seeking to eradicate a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that included preferential provisions for a racial and ethnic teachers, which the claimant asserted violated the Equal Protection clause of Article I, section 2, of the Minnesota Constitution.

The Hennepin County District Court dismissed the case, but the appellate court reversed, leading the Supreme Court to take the opportunity to apply the requirements for taxpayer standing … that [was] recently clarified” in the Hunt case last year. True to his word, Justice Procacinni, did “resolve this case based on standing,” relying upon “the recent clarification requirements for taxpayer standing in Hunt.” In so doing, the court concluded that the “central dispute in this case did not involve unlawful disbursement of public funds and, therefore, the claimant lacks taxpayer standing.”

Standing sustained

But in another case involving public school teachers in Minnesota, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed taxpayer standing in Huizenga v. Independent School District No. 11, 44 F.4th 806 (8th Cir. 2022). The case was brought by three residents in Anoka County against a school district and the union representing teachers, concerning a teacher reimbursement plan contained in the collective bargaining agreement, which the claimants alleged violated constitutional statutory provisions.

In a per curiam decision, reversing a ruling of U.S. District Court Judge Jerry Blackwell in Minnesota, the court held that the Anoka residents had “adequately alleged that the school district taxpayers” and further identified a “municipal action” that caused injury to them, consisting of the expenditure of tax revenue by a public school district on the “allegedly illegal action” under the bargaining agreement, because the teachers are given up to 100 days of paid leave, which their union does not fully reimburse the school district for those expenses. Because Judge Blackwell had not addressed “preliminary injunction factors,” the case was sent back for determination whether injunctive relief was appropriate.

On remand, Judge Blackwell last year decided it was not and dismissed the case, again, for lack of standing under Article III of the Federal Constitution on grounds that the lawsuit did not demonstrate that municipal taxpayer funds were spent on the contested activity relied on “unclear data and unfounded assumptions, [with] … no actual expenses.” He explained that the lawsuit was premised on an argument that is “the same kind made in households every day — that wages should be higher and expenses should be lower.” That government spending “should be more, less, or allocated differently,” constituted an insufficient basis to sustain standing for the three claimant taxpayers. 727 F. Supp. 3rd 812 (D. Minn. 2024).

The organization supporting the lawsuit, the Upper Midwest Law Center, expressed that it was “disappointed” in the ruling and pledged to appeal it, again, in its commitment to “defending constitutional rights,” which it promptly did last spring, taking it up again to the Circuit Court, which again reversed Judge Blackwell. Huizenga v. Independent School District #11, 2025 WL 2302432 (August 11, 2025) (nonprecedential). By a 2-1 vote, an appellate panel ruled that two of the taxpayers who still lived in the school district had standing to proceed with the case (the other one had moved out) because they established a “direct injury” due to the “direct expenditure of district funds” to pay for substitute teachers to fill in while full-timers were engaged in the permissible non-teaching activities allowed under the union contract. The case, thus, bounced back to Judge Blackwell for a third look at the litigation, a tripling down of the Groundhog Day phenomenon. See Perspectives, “Groundhog Day recalls litigation do-overs” in the January 27, 2025, edition of Minnesota Lawyer.

Latest lawsuits

But Judge Blackwell fared better this summer in another standing dispute in Pickle v. Minnesota Association of Townships, 2025WL 1793838 (8th Cir. June 20, 2025)(nonprecedential), the 8th Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds of lack of standing by Judge Blackwell of the most recent of a multitude of legal actions by a group opposed to actions of a nonprofit organization of township governments. But the court held that the disposition should be without prejudice, rather than with prejudice, because the absence of standing constitutes a jurisdictional defect.

In a case decided a week earlier, the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that a sole shareholder of a consulting company aggrieved by unreasonable expenses in connection with a business project could not sue “in an individual capacity” to seek reimbursement owing to his entity. Levy v. Daily Dental Care, LLC, 2025 WL 1733444 (Minn. App. June 23, 2025)(nonprecedential). The lawsuit could not proceed because the individual owner could not sue for a claimed injury to his company, which alone was entitled to bring the claim.

The summer came to a close with a standing issue that the 8th Circuit bypassed and chose to affirm on other grounds in Swanson v. Hilgers, 2025 WL 2425192 (8th Cir. Aug. 22, 2025). The case was brought by a midwife who challenged various state law regulatory practices that she claimed were violative of her rights and those of her future patients.

But her claim was stillborn at the district court level, which dismissed her claims on the merits and refused to address the prospective patients’ claims on grounds of lack of standing. The circuit court affirmed in the merits, skipping over the standing issue, on grounds that the various challenged licensing restrictions were within the “legitimate interest of protecting health, safety, and welfare.”

To cap off the nine standing suits, the Minnesota Court of Appeals early last month upheld the standing of a labor union-related organization to sue a business offering consumers coupons and access to prescription drugs discounts on grounds that the arrangements violated Minn. Stat. § 325F.784, which governs prescription drug discount cards although it did not claim any actual damages suffered by the group. Affirming a ruling of the McCleod County District Court, the Court of Appeals upheld the standing of the organization to bring that suit because the “plain and unambiguous language” of the statute permits a suit to be brought without the claimant alleging it that it has suffered “an injury in fact” due to misleading or other improper consumer practices, directed to consumers in Minnesota Teamsters Service Bureau v. GoodRx, Inc., 2025 WL 2502013 (Minn. App. Sept. 2, 2025)(nonprecedential).

Suspension standing

As the summer drew to a close the Minnesota Court of Appeals addressed standing, in a criminal case, State v. Peters, 2025 WL 2586840 (Minn. App. Sept. 8, 2025)(nonprecedential). The Polk County District Court’s dismissal of a suppressed motion in a drug possession an driving while impaired (DWI) case on grounds that the defendant lacked standing to challenge his seizure in his car by police in East Grand Forks was reversed. The district court rejected the motion because the defendant was employed in Minnesota in violation of an order from next door in North Dakota, where he lived, while leaving the state when he was on probation without court permission, which he lacked.

Lacking permission, he also lacked standing, the Polk County judge reasoned.

But the reasoning lacked a viable basis, according to the Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded. It reasoned that the lower court’s rationale was “misguided” because the resident it ruled upon involved a seizure in a home, rather than as here, a vehicle on a public street.

The issue of standing was dispositive last month in a decision by the 8th Circuit rejecting a challenge to the Minnesota “anti-captive audience” law, Minn. Stat. §181.531 in Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors v. Ellison, 2025 WL 2526268_(8th Cir. 2025)(nonprecedential). Reversing a ruling of U. S. District Court Judge Patrick Schlitz, the Court by a 2-1 vote, over the dissent of Judge James Loken of Minnesota, held that the claimant business groups could not pursue a pre-enforcement challenge to the 2023 measure known as the Employer – Sponsored Meetings and Communications Act (ESMCA), one of a dozen in the country, that bars adverse action by employers against employees who decline to receive communications or participate in meetings in which management expound on political “political or religious matters,” including labor union- related issues.

The controlling two members of the panel dismissed claims grounded on the first amendment right of freedom of expression and federal labor law preemption against Gov. Tim Walz and the commissioner of the Department Of Labor And Industry. A claim against Attorney General Keith Ellison also was dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment because he has declared that he will not enforce the law, which negates any “standing“ by the claimants to maintain the statutory challenge.

These varied cases reflect that, regardless of the merits of a lawsuit, claimants must often overcome standing barriers in order to pursue them.

A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.
“That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.” The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE — a 10-fold increase in its current budget — as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress’ failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration’s top priority, is still flush with cash.

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,"" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Friday, total spending on the ads had topped $5.7 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, $794,084, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city's Police Officers Association, said he'd seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city's police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.""

The government shutdown could dampen ICE's recruitment hopes, he said.

""They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,"" he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It's the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who's in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.”

The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.

This is the second batch of deportees that the Trump administration has sent to Eswatini as part of its hard-line approach towards immigration.

The 10 have been ""securely accommodated"", and posed no threat to the public, Eswatini's prison department said in a statement.

Eswatini human rights lawyer Mzwandile Masuku told the BBC he was ""shocked and dismayed"" that the government had taken in the group, despite an ongoing court case against the arrival of five deportees in July.

The US had described the five - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as ""depraved monsters"".

The Jamaican has since been repatriated to his country of origin, while another two were expected to be repatriated soon, Eswatini's government says.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would take in 11 deportees following an agreement with the US ""to cooperate in this manner"".

It did not explain why only 10 had arrived.

Their names have not been made public.

Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent

The BBC reported in September that the Trump administration had told Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the centre of a long-running immigration row, he could be deported to the southern African kingdom.

The administration alleges that he was a member of a transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then returned to the US where he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He pleaded not guilty.

A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for ""vindictive"" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision.

The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported.

In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a ""secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin"".

Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane.

Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected the government to ""respect the court process and await its ruling"" before accepting more deportees.

In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments.

It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its ""border and migration management capacity"", HRW said.

The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to ""executive over-reach"" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance.

Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.

The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of ""democratic regression"", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.

""We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,"" the SALC's Melusi Simelane told the BBC.

The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.

Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at ""top clearance level"".

The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border.

Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility.

The Trump administration has adopted a foreign policy approach of prioritizing economic and security relations with countries where interests converge. This strategy may be initially popular with some foreign leaders who think their countries could gain more from trade than they did from aid, but it is already clashing with the administration’s credo of “America First.” This tension is most visible in U.S-Africa relations.

The Trump administration’s early push for a commercial diplomacy strategy for Africa that prioritizes trade over aid was welcomed by many African leaders. These leaders have long called for the United States to recognize the African continent as a commercial partner, and not only as an aid recipient. The United States, of course, has a long history of commercial diplomacy in Africa. The Trump administration is trying to distinguish its approach, especially for its domestic constituencies, by emphasizing trade benefits, private sector investments, and bankable partnerships for U.S. businesses, while also seeking to persuade African leaders of the potential for economic growth. Recently retired Ambassador Troy Fitrell, the State Department’s senior bureau official for Africa who helped craft the administration’s policy, told an audience in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, in May 2025 that the administration’s strategy would be implemented in close partnership with U.S companies, African governments, and other stakeholders to create conditions for economic growth on the continent.

While the U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region.

Africa’s growing strategic and geopolitical relevance—given the potential of its burgeoning population and its store of the critical minerals needed to serve the globe’s high-tech needs—offers clear areas where U.S interests converge with opportunities, and a commercial diplomacy strategy could help achieve alignment. But foreign policy does not operate in a vacuum: All foreign policy is inherently domestic, and under this administration, domestic priorities such as supporting U.S. businesses strongly influence the foreign policy agenda. This creates challenges in the conception and execution of a commercial diplomacy strategy for Africa. Perhaps two areas where this tension is most visible are trade protectionism and immigration reform.

How Have Trump’s Policies Impacted Africa? How Is Africa Responding?

Trade Protectionism

The Trump administration’s April 2, 2025, “Liberation Day” Executive Order 14257, which proposed significant tariffs aimed at addressing trade deficits and promoting U.S. economic independence, undermines the administration’s own trade-over-aid agenda in Africa. The order (since modified more than once) initially imposed baseline 10 percent tariffs on 29 African countries and placed higher tariffs on 20 more African countries, reaching up to 50 percent for Lesotho—the second-highest rate after China. Lesotho, one of Africa’s smallest economies and greatly reliant on textile exports to the United States, declared a state of disaster in its textile industry before Trump announced a 90-day pause. Following the administration’s modification of reciprocal tariff rates on July 31, Lesotho’s new duty on imports decreased to 15 percent, which has provided some relief. But about 12,000 textile jobs in Lesotho hang in the balance. The country is now courting buyers from other markets for its goods.

Trump also has imposed a 30 percent tariff on select South African goods and has threatened a 10 percent increase in tariffs for nations aligned with the BRICS bloc of major emerging economies. These sets of tariffs impact two of Africa’s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, along with many smaller countries. The 30 percent tariff on South Africa is expected to significantly impact the country’s job market, especially in the automotive parts industry, which relies heavily on duty-free exports to the United States. Nigeria’s tariff rate, now at 15 percent, may rise by an additional 10 percent given it recently joined BRICS in January 2025 as a partner country, just before Trump took office with a view of BRICS’ policies as “anti-American.”

Although the Trump administration ultimately modified some of its tariffs on Africa, the levies have caused uncertainty and panic for many African countries that rely heavily on trade with the United States. The tariffs have shaken African economies and raised significant doubts about the intent of the United States’ commercial diplomacy strategy, with some questioning whether it is only about securing minerals from the continent and not a mutually beneficial partnership.

The Trump administration has demonstrated a preference for a transactional foreign policy approach on the continent; for example, earlier this year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) offered exclusive mineral rights for U.S. companies in exchange for U.S. security assistance against the M23 rebel group, a paramilitary force backed by neighboring Rwanda. The request influenced a subsequent peace deal between the DRC and Rwanda, brokered by the United States, that apparently would grant rights to certain critical minerals to foreign investors, including from the United States. The declaration of principles for peace that was signed in June 2025 by the foreign ministers of the DRC and Rwanda purportedly is intended to provide economic incentives for all parties involved through what State Department Senior Advisor on Africa Massad Boulos described as a “regional economic integration framework.”

The U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region.

The quest to secure critical minerals appears to be a key focus of this administration, playing a significant role in Trump’s early overtures to Ukraine as well. And while the U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region. Notably, the presidents of the warring countries were absent from the June signing, which included an Oval Office appearance with the two foreign ministers; a key rebel group was not involved in those talks; and significant hurdles to implementation remain. Without an enabling environment of stability and security, it would be difficult for U.S businesses to operate in the region.

The tariffs also placed a question mark over the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which has given African countries tariff-free access to U.S. markets for 25 years. AGOA expired in September 2025, and at the time of this writing, there is no clear indication of whether and how it will be renewed, a step that would have to be taken by Congress. Many in the Trump administration have noted its significance, and Trump himself, when asked about AGOA during the July 2025 summit he conducted with five African presidents—from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal—said that he would “look at” extending the trade pact. But many African leaders doubt the prospects of AGOA’s renewal, given its no-tariff regime for some goods.

Meanwhile, China is already Africa’s biggest trading partner, giving nearly the entire continent tariff-free access to its markets: In June 2025, China removed tariffs for 53 African countries. That will help expand the already notable gap between Chinese and U.S. trade figures with Africa—Africa’s trade in goods with China rose 6.1 percent in 2024 to $295 billion compared with $72 billion of goods traded with the United States.

In response to this uncertain environment and to counter Trump’s tariffs, African countries are doubling down on efforts to leverage their flagship free trade initiative, the African Continental Free Trade Area. That initiative, which began trading in 2021 to bring the continent’s 1.4 billion people in more than 50 countries into a single market, has been slow in implementation. While 49 countries have ratified the agreement, fewer than half are actively trading under its umbrella—though the initiative has still seen some progress. In the meantime, African nations are expanding trade ties with China, the European Union, and Persian Gulf states.

Immigration Reform

The Trump administration’s immigration policies also undermine its commercial diplomacy strategy and economic partnership narrative with Africa. Washington has imposed sweeping visa and travel restrictions under the premise that tightening them protects U.S. national security. But these moves significantly harm many African countries by, among other impacts, hindering the travel required for trade and investment, distracting African leaders who must deal with the sociopolitical effects, and poisoning the atmosphere between U.S. and African leaders.

Distracting from economic issues, the administration’s July summit with the five African leaders included a push to have African countries accept third-country nationals deported from the United States, hardly creating the atmosphere of mutual respect needed to develop strong economic relations. Furthermore, the United States has imposed complete or partial visa bans on at least 19 countries, 10 of which are in Africa. All this comes on top of Trump’s divisive new policy of admitting white Afrikaner South Africans who claim persecution because of discrimination and violence as refugees.

Multiple African officials have condemned the punitive Trump administration measures as unacceptable and counterproductive. Nigeria, for example, said that while it is eager to strengthen trade ties with the United States, the travel restrictions are a major hinderance. Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar publicly rejected the Trump administration’s pressure for the country to accept third-nation asylum seekers, saying the country has “enough problems of our own” and will not cave to U.S. coercion to take in deportees with no ties to Nigeria.

The Trump administration’s new immigration policies also severely restrict student visas, with many African youth heavily impacted; even those already studying in the United States are being cautioned against leaving because they may not be able to return. This is another case of the Trump administration shooting its foreign trade and investment policy in the wallet, so to speak, as Africa’s youth boom is becoming a major economic force globally. The World Economic Forum has reported that “by 2035, there will be more young Africans entering the workforce each year than in the rest of the world combined.” And China already has a significant numbers advantage over the United States in attracting the best and brightest of them to its education system.

Implications and Recommendations for the United States

The United States must rightfully prioritize its domestic national interests. But foreign policy interests are inextricably intertwined with domestic priorities in today’s globally interdependent world, even for the economically powerful United States. It would be shortsighted, to say the least, to hamper potentially beneficial and even lucrative economic ties abroad with counterproductive measures that might undermine the goals of trade and economic growth. The Trump administration risks falling further into that trap by failing to balance these interests in a way that helps, not hurts, Americans—not to mention, in this case, Africans as well. The administration’s much-touted commercial diplomacy is at stake.

As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, the United States must clearly identify why it wants to—and why it must—engage with African countries.

As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, the United States must clearly identify why it wants to—and why it must—engage with African countries, and it cannot just be to displace China with more of the same. That would be of little interest to African leaders or Africa’s citizens. Why shift from one usurious “partner” to another?

Instead, the Trump administration would find more economic success by understanding fully how it can distinguish itself in the eyes of potential partners. As noted, China already surpasses the United States in trade with African countries and is also increasing its investment in the soft-power approaches that the United States has been using for years, such as in education. And now the Trump administration is eviscerating many of the soft-power tools that gave the country a competitive edge in Africa, not only by restricting immigration and educational exchange but also by dismantling major institutions such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the source of extensive U.S.-Africa economic ties. Among other initiatives, the gutting of USAID took down the 2013 Power Africa project, which aimed to help the continent get up to par on energy production—crucial to any economic development. Another program that fell to the axe was Prosper Africa, a promising initiative created under the first Trump administration that facilitated the creation of the government-backed but private U.S.-Africa Trade Desk to further enhance trade cooperation. The Trump administration has also suspended the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, which once helped reduce risks in early-stage investments and could have been instrumental in ensuring a successful commercial diplomacy strategy. And while the administration retained its Africa bureau in a recent reorganization of the State Department, it has considered significantly scaling back embassy representation on the continent.

Some of the best-performing government agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) are now under severe budget-cutting pressure. Despite this, the MCC seems to be rebounding with the recent announcement of a $300 million electrification grant for Cote D’Ivoire. Investments like this by the MCC are crucial to deliver the infrastructure needed for successful trade and investment and ensuring that its high-profile senior-level delegations to the continent are not simply symbolic. The administration has signaled that it plans to rely much more on financial institutions such as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation—also facing reauthorization this year—which provides financing and other assistance for development projects, and the U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank, which provides credit to support U.S. trade. The EXIM Bank, for example, announced in August a $66 million guarantee for a small Washington, D.C.–based exporter of equipment for a new national data center in Côte d’Ivoire. But even then, the announcement makes clear that a key motivator is that the offer “displaces competition” from China. The project could nevertheless be promising, if it is accompanied by the right personnel on the ground—after all, people equal policy.

Similarly, the administration still has a chance to correct or offset its travel restrictions and tariff decisions and its extensive cuts to foreign assistance and diplomacy in ways that support the president’s agenda of commercial diplomacy with Africa, rather than weakening U.S. influence around the globe. The reorganization of the State Department, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in May 2025, should be aimed at ensuring that qualified personnel with experience on the continent are in decisionmaking positions for any offices or programs related to Africa. The department needs advanced skills and experience to successfully navigate complex relationships, not only with overseas partners but also with other U.S. government agencies that could be helpful if the president is really serious about an agenda that prioritizes trade over aid. Any budget deliberations with Congress for FY 2026 should ensure sufficient funding to keep embassies staffed and running and for the State Department to advance these priorities. Renewing AGOA should be another priority—it is not a perfect tool, but it offers the possibility to innovate and create more jobs and opportunities for both the United States and Africa.

In pursuing their commercial diplomacy, Trump and his cabinet should ask—and answer—a question honestly: What makes the United States different from China? The perceptions of citizens everywhere are shaped by their lived experiences, and Africans’ perceptions of China remain relatively positive despite some recent decreases in Chinese funding to the continent. The most recent Afrobarometer survey of 30 African countries finds that 60 percent of Africans hold a positive view of China’s economic and political influence, compared with 53 percent who say the same of the United States. Five years earlier, the two global powers were neck-in-neck, at 59 percent for China and 58 percent for the United States.",https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-10/GettyImages-2224312581_cropped.jpg?VersionId=iL6bdy8.YpsqMfu0HWT5SyI4ZXGAG1zr,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:33.699253

The group of agents was conducting a routine patrol on the city’s South Side on Saturday “when they were attacked and rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

The agents were on patrol about 15 miles from the anti-ICE protests that had been simmering for several days outside the ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when the attack began.

Once they attempted to flee their trapped vehicle, a woman — later found to be toting a semi-automatic weapon — attempted to run the officers down, but was shot by police.

Local cops were initially prepared to help the agents, but were ordered to stand down by the chief of patrol, according to shocking dispatch audio transmissions.

“Younger male Hispanic wearing all black … wanted for the hit-and-run, this guy fled from the scene,” a female dispatcher blares in response to a call for help from the surrounded ICE agents on audio shared by ExxAlerts.

“When the offending vehicle crashed, they ran the federal agent off the road, they fled on foot westbound.”

A male voice then comes on the radio channel, telling the dispatcher to direct officers to head to the scene and “stay put” a few blocks away and await further instruction, which she relays.

A few seconds later, the male voice is heard again, saying tersely: “Per the chief of patrol: Clear everybody out, we’re not responding over there.”

The female dispatcher then tells officers on the way to the distress call, “per the chief of patrol, all units clear out from there, we’re not sending anybody out to that location.”

A male officer responds over the sound of sirens wailing in the background, saying, “We’re going to clear out as soon as we can, we’re like blocked in over here so we’re going to do the best we can to get out of here as soon as we can.”

An internal department memo sent to Chicago cops and obtained by Fox News confirms the shocking reversal.

“PLEASE CHIEF OF PATROL NO UNITS WILL RESPOND TO THIS AS RELATED FROM 04-Oc5-2025/12:34:44…CALLER IS 1 OF APPROX 30 ARMED PATROL AGENTS (ICE) WHO ARE BEING SURROUNDED BY A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE REQUESTING CPD,” the dispatch message read.

The Chicago Police Department disputed the claims, saying its officers were on the scene.

“To clarify misinformation currently circulating, CPD officers did in fact respond to the shooting scene involving federal authorities on Saturday to maintain public safety and traffic control,” the department said in a statement to Fox.

“The Chicago Police Department will always respond to anyone who is being attacked or is under the threat of physical harm,” the department added. “For incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, CPD supervisors will respond to the scene and determine the appropriate course of action in accordance with City law.”

Ten cars had surrounded the federal agents, Trump officials said.

“Today in Chicago, members of our brave law enforcement were attacked — rammed and boxed in by ten vehicles, including an attacker with a semi-automatic weapon,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X in response to the attack, pledging to send more resources to the crime-ravaged city.

The mob had gathered in the area near 39th Place and South Kedzie Avenue to protest the shooting of the armed woman and was met with tear gas deployed by federal agents, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The latest spate of violence in the Windy City comes after US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” an initiative to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor [JB] Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the department announced in an X post.

Protesters have increasingly used vehicles to attack ICE agents in the Chicago area in recent days, according to DHS, which said agents were targeted twice in such a manner in one day earlier this week.

No officers were injured in the mob attack, and the woman shot defensively by police reportedly drove herself to the hospital to be treated for her wounds.

More than a dozen protesters have been arrested near the ICE facility since Friday, according to Fox News.

But until now, the justices have not squarely addressed the legality of Mr. Trump’s boundary-pushing policies to transform the government.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, cautioned against reading too much into the Supreme Court’s preliminary orders.
Only in this term, he said, will the justices show whether they plan to curb Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power.","When the nine justices of the Supreme Court return to their raised mahogany bench each year on the first Monday of October, it typically marks the end of a three-month stretch of rest and reflection.

But this summer’s traditional recess was anything but a cooling-off period.

Instead, the justices churned through emergency requests from the Trump administration that sharply divided the court along ideological lines, in a reflection of how much President Trump’s agenda has consumed their calendar.

The president’s policies will have an even more central role in the term that begins on Monday, after the justices agreed to take three cases with broad consequences for his agenda. In November, they will hear arguments about the legality of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, a centerpiece of his trade strategy. In December, they will consider Mr. Trump’s efforts to wrest control of independent agencies, and in January, his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board.

By the time the term ends in June, there could be others. Already, the administration has asked the court to take up a pair of cases testing the legality of the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, an issue that raises fundamental questions about what it means to be an American.

The result will be a term of generational consequence for the court and the presidency, and a defining one for the legacy of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will mark his 20th year on the bench.

“It’s hard to imagine bigger tests of presidential power than these potentially once-in-a-century separation-of-powers battles,” said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer at the firm Gupta Wessler who frequently argues cases before the justices. “And we’re seeing more than one of them at once.”

Since Mr. Trump took office in January, the court’s conservative majority has repeatedly sided with the administration. But those decisions came in a series of emergency, unsigned orders. Often published without reasoning on what critics call the “shadow docket,” the orders have technically been temporary, addressing whether a challenged policy could be implemented while its legality was tested in court.

But until now, the justices have not squarely addressed the legality of Mr. Trump’s boundary-pushing policies to transform the government.

That will change this term, as the justices confront Mr. Trump’s policies head-on, offering final judgments on whether they are legal, in cases that include oral arguments and decisions with lengthy opinions.

“We’re going to see, among others things, whether the Supreme Court is actually going to say no to Donald Trump on anything,” said Pamela S. Karlan, a co-director of Stanford Law School’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic and former Justice Department official in the Obama and Biden administrations.

“They’ve tried to dodge and tried to dodge and tried to dodge saying no to him by coming up with procedural ways to say yes to him,” Ms. Karlan said. “But I don’t see how they get out of this term doing it that way.”

Apart from the administration’s cases testing the limits of executive authority, the court will hear a series of other consequential matters, including more politically charged legal battles over gender identity.

Last term, the court divided along ideological lines when it allowed Tennessee to prohibit some medical treatments for transgender youths. On Tuesday, the justices will consider a challenge from a Christian therapist who objected to a Colorado law prohibiting licensed mental health therapists from counseling minors to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.

The court will also hear legal challenges to state laws barring transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams.

Major cases that could reshape the election landscape are also on the docket, including one that could result in the justices striking down or severely restraining a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

That case involves a challenge to Louisiana’s voting map, which was adopted following the 2020 census and includes two majority-Black congressional districts.

The justices heard a challenge to the map in the spring. Rather than rule on whether state lawmakers unlawfully emphasized race in drawing the map, as some non-Black residents had argued, the justices announced that they would hear the case again with a more expansive constitutional question. The rare move suggested that some members of the court might be ready to use the case to gut the Voting Rights Act, a pillar of the Civil Rights era that conservatives have been whittling down in recent years.

The justices this week will also hear a challenge to rules on mail-in ballots in Illinois, a case that could open the way for efforts to restrict voting by mail. And later in the term, the court will consider what could become a landmark case on campaign finance regulations — a challenge to federal guardrails that limit political parties from coordinating with candidates to spend money on campaign advertising.

But the heart of the court’s work this term, which by tradition will stretch into late June or early July, is likely to involve Mr. Trump.

The justices have so far issued more than 20 orders in response to emergency applications involving the Trump administration, ruling overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s favor in decisions that were technically placeholders.

Their rulings have addressed preliminary questions, such as who has the right to sue and in which court. But the immediate impact of those interim orders has been significant. In recent months, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to withhold billions of dollars in foreign aid funding; to begin dismantling the Education Department; to deport migrants to war-torn countries where they have no connections; and to kick transgender troops out of the military. While the majority’s rulings are often brief, the three liberal justices have issued lengthy and impassioned dissents.

Irv Gornstein, who leads the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown Law School, said it was hard to ignore the court’s overwhelming habit of dividing along ideological lines when issuing emergency orders in the Trump administration’s favor.

Mr. Gornstein added that if those voting patterns hold when the court reaches final decisions about the validity of the administration’s policies, and with other controversial cases on its docket, “we are in for one of the most polarizing terms yet.”

The opening months of the term feature back-to-back tests of the president’s agenda. The justices have fast-tracked review of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, after a lower court said the president exceeded his authority by invoking a 1970s-era emergency power to tax imports from major trading partners. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act has typically been used to impose sanctions and embargoes against other nations. It does not mention the word tariff.

Some leading conservative and libertarian scholars have said in court filings that the president’s use of the statute to impose tariffs was unlawful, and that the power to tax must remain with Congress. If the justices agree with the lower courts that Mr. Trump improperly invoked the act, the president will be forced to remove that set of tariffs. But the administration is already issuing tariffs under other legal provisions.

In December, the court will examine the president’s power to fire a leader of the Federal Trade Commission, revisiting a 90-year precedent that has allowed Congress to pass laws preventing presidents from removing independent regulators solely over policy disagreements.

Even before Mr. Trump returned to office, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority had taken steps to make it easier for presidents to remove independent agency leaders, signaling it would be receptive to claims of executive power.

In January, the court will consider whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor. The justices have signaled in a separate case that the Fed is uniquely independent, and their decision will have far-reaching implications for the central bank and the U.S. economy.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, cautioned against reading too much into the Supreme Court’s preliminary orders. Only in this term, he said, will the justices show whether they plan to curb Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power.

“That’s why this term is so important. Plenty of folks think that question has already been answered, but the conclusive evidence is still to come,” Mr. Vladeck said.

Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William & Mary who specializes in administrative and constitutional law, said that one reason Mr. Trump had been so successful at the court so far was that his lawyers had been able to cherry-pick which cases to bring to the justices, largely avoiding some of the thornier disputes.

The result, he said, was an “unrepresentative sample.”

The rulings so far “don’t really tell us how the court views the substance of what the administration has been planning,” he said.

Chief Justice Roberts this term will become the fourth-longest-serving chief in the court’s history.

A student of history, he is an admirer of the longest-serving chief justice in American history, John Marshall, who avoided issuing rulings that would provoke direct confrontations with President Thomas Jefferson — a model he will now have to decide whether to emulate.

He will preside over a court with members who appear to be growing more restless. Throughout the summer, in appearances at judicial conferences and book talks, the justices aired disagreements over how the court was handling the president’s many requests, including how much the court should explain itself to the public and lower-court judges.

Tensions among the justices have also spilled out in their emergency rulings, in which the court’s liberals have sometimes included sharp words as their colleagues have cleared the way for the president’s agenda.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in particular has pointedly criticized her conservative colleagues, characterizing one ruling in July as “not only truly unfortunate but also hubristic and senseless.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested in a separate dissent in July that the majority was giving special treatment to Mr. Trump, writing that the administration “has the Supreme Court on speed dial.”

Kannon Shanmugam, who regularly argues cases before the court, said the bench that Chief Justice Roberts joined in 2005 was made up of justices who appeared more interested in the court’s institutional reputation.

“I think the chief justice is very much in that vein, but he doesn’t have a lot of partners right now in that regard, said Mr. Shanmugam, who was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. “The challenge the chief justice has going forward is in managing this somewhat more individualistic and somewhat more fractious group of colleagues.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/05/multimedia/05DC-SCOTUS-fclj/05DC-SCOTUS-fclj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:58:28.516172

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu and his government resigned today. Lecornu, who was appointed in September, named his new cabinet hours before their resignations. Lecornu pointed to political parties “who continue to posture as if they had a majority” in France’s hung National Assembly as the reason for his decision. France’s main opposition parties called on French President Emmanuel Macron to call new parliamentary elections or resign in the wake of Lecornu’s departure. Victor Goury-Laffont reports for POLITICO.

The populist party of the Czech Republic’s former Prime Minister, billionaire Andrej Babiš, on Saturday won parliamentary elections in the country, although it fell short of an overall majority. Babiš, who during the election campaign argued that the high consumer costs are linked to the Czech Republic spending too much to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, is expected to be invited to lead talks on forming a new coalition. Rob Cameron reports for BBC News; Lara Jakes reports for the New York Times.

Syria yesterday held its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad regime, with the vote count ongoing at the time of writing. Voting in three provinces dominated by Kurdish and Druze factions was postponed due to “security and logistical challenges,” the authorities said. Eyad Kourdi reports for CNN.

Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Saturday elected hardline conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. If confirmed in an Oct. 15 parliamentary vote, Takaichi will become the country’s first female prime minister. A protégé of the late former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has vowed to bring back his economic vision, known as “Abenomics.” Tim Kelly, John Geddie, and Satoshi Sugiyama report for Reuters; Shaimaa Khalil reports for BBC News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner are expected to participate in negotiations in Egypt today on ending the war in Gaza, according to a White House official. Delegations from Israel and Hamas will participate in indirect talks on the first phase of the deal, concerning hostage release and prisoner exchange mediated by Egypt and Qatar, the Egyptian foreign ministry said yesterday. Hamas on Friday expressed willingness to release the remaining hostages but did not comment on many other parts of the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan, such as disarmament. Ashley Ahn, Shawn McCreesh, and Aaron Boxerman report for the New York Times.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday said that the United States was aiming for a quick deal to return the hostages to Israel, noting that the next phase of negotiations dealing with disarmament and setting up a new government in Gaza would be tougher. Trump said yesterday that talks with Hamas were advancing rapidly. “I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said on social media. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters; Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

Israeli airstrikes killed at least 36 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, according to local health officials. 18 people died in sporadic incidents, while 18 others were killed in a strike on a house in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, medical staff said. The strikes occurred after Trump’s call on social media on Friday evening for Israel to stop bombing Gaza. Trump on Saturday said he appreciated that Israel had “temporarily stopped bombing.” Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Mahmoud Issa report for Reuters.

“I don’t know why you’re always so f***ing negative. This is a win. Take it,” Trump told Netanyahu on Friday evening following Hamas’ initial positive response to the ceasefire plan, a U.S. official told Axios. The source said that Netanyahu had told Trump there was nothing to celebrate and that Hamas’ position meant nothing. An Israeli official said that Netanyahu viewed Hamas’ response as a rejection of Trump’s plan. Trump told Axios on Saturday that Netanyahu’s “fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine.” Barak Ravid and Marc Caputo report.

Israel has deported a further 29 activists who were detained last week for taking part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, the Israeli foreign ministry said yesterday. Israel has deported 170 of the 450 detained activists so far. Alexander Cornwell reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russia yesterday killed at least five people and damaged energy infrastructure across Ukraine, officials said. Four of those killed were in the western Lviv region, bordering Poland. The combined assault, which involved dozens of missiles and over 500 drones, struck nine regions in Ukraine and cut electricity for tens of thousands of people. Siobhán O’Grady and Serhiy Morgunov report for the Washington Post; Andriy Perun and Dan Peleschuk report for Reuters.

There is evidence of a “high level of cooperation” between China and Russia “in conducting satellite reconnaissance” of Ukraine to identify strategic objects to target, a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said on Saturday. The official did not disclose what evidence supported this position. Ron Popeski reports for Reuters.

Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda will not sign an economic framework agreement this week as scheduled under the U.S.-brokered June peace agreement, sources told Reuters on Friday. According to a Rwandan official, the text was finalized after a round of negotiations in Washington, D.C., but Kinshasa was unwilling to sign the deal. Daphne Psaledakis, Jessica Donati, and Sonia Rolley report.

The U.N. Human Rights Council will today consider an EU proposal to set up a U.N. investigation into abuses in Afghanistan by both the Taliban and foreign troops similar to existing investigations into crimes in Syria and Myanmar. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Trump is expected to reduce refugee admissions from 125,000 to 7,500 people per year, according to a presidential determination signed 30 September seen by the New York Times. The unannounced refugee program proposes to reserve a bulk of the limited slots for white Afrikaners from South Africa, according to sources.

ICE agents arrested 37 people and separated U.S. children from their parents during an overnight raid on apartments in Chicago last week. The Homeland Security Department said the building was targeted because it was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members.” Tenants said it appeared that everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including four children who are U.S. citizens. DHS said the children were taken because their parents were detained due to their lack of legal status. Rebekah Riess and Bill Kirkos report for CNN.

The Trump administration is offering $2,500 to minors who came to the United States alone to “voluntarily” return to their home countries under a programme rolled out on Friday without a press release. ICE confirmed to POLITICO that ICE and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugees and Resettlement are offering a “strictly voluntary” self-deportation service. Erica Bazail-Eimil reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN THE CARIBBEAN

Trump said yesterday that U.S. forces hit another vessel allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela on Saturday. It is currently unclear if Trump was in fact referencing a strike announced on Friday by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. “They’re not coming in by sea anymore, so now we’ll have to start looking about the land,” Trump continued in a speech delivered at Naval Station Norfolk. Reuters reports.

The U.S. military killed four people in a strike against a boat in international waters near Venezuela, Hegseth announced on Friday. Hegseth alleged that the men had been smuggling narcotics but did not offer any evidence. This was the first strike since the Trump administration told Congress that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with Latin American cartels. Hegseth said yesterday that he has every authorization needed for U.S. military strikes on vessels off the coast of Venezuela. “These are designated foreign terrorist organizations.” Charlie Savage reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

China is using a barter-like system to pay Iran for oil while bypassing U.S. sanctions, Western officials told the Wall Street Journal. In order to side-step the international banking system, Iranian oil is shipped to China and, in return, state-backed Chinese companies build infrastructure in Iran. Some officials said that up to $8.4 billion in oil payments flowed through the hidden funding conduit last year to finance the Chinese infrastructure projects. Lauren Norman and James T. Areddy report.

Advisers of Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir approached U.S. officials with an offer to build and run a port on the Arabian Sea, according to a plan seen by the Financial Times. The plan envisages U.S. investors developing the town of Pasni as a terminal to ship Pakistan’s critical minerals to the United States. A senior U.S. official said that Trump and his advisers had not discussed such a proposal. Alec Russell and Humza Jilani report.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) yesterday criticised ICE agents for using increasingly violent tactics in Chicago, such as deploying chemical agents near a public school. “They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Pritzker said. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades.” Pritzker suggested that the Trump administration was intentionally heightening tensions in Chicago in order to send “even more troops.” Sophia Tareen reports for AP News.

“This morning, the Trump administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Gov. JB Pritzker said on Saturday, adding that Trump plans to federalize 300 National Guard troops in Illinois despite his clear opposition. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth considered sending an elite U.S. Army strike force to Portland to quell the protests last weekend, according to messages shared with the Minnesota Star Tribune. The messages show high-level officials discussing the deployment of the Army’s 82nd Airborne, an infantry division deployed during both world wars and the Vietnam War. Anthony Salisbury, a deputy to White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, sent the texts over Signal while traveling in Minnesota, in clear view of others. Andy Mannix reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Trump administration is preparing a plan that would make it harder for older Americans to qualify for Social Security disability payments, sources tell the Washington Post. Under the plan, the Social Security Administration would either no longer consider age in assessing whether a person can adjust to other types of work, or the age threshold would be increased to 60 years, the sources said. Meryl Kornfield and Lisa Rein report.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge this weekend twice blocked the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops into Oregon. In her initial Saturday order, the judge ruled that Trump’s claims that Portland was experiencing daily unrest were “untethered to facts” and said that she expected a trial court to find that the move exceeded Trump’s constitutional authority and likely violated the Tenth Amendment. Late yesterday, the judge issued a follow-up order banning the Trump administration from sending any National Guard troops to Portland after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tried to send hundreds of members of Texas’ and California’s National Guard to Oregon. The judge said that Hegseth’s action appeared to be “in direct contravention” of her earlier decision. The Trump administration has appealed the Saturday order. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO; Anna Griffin reports for the New York Times; Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration can, for now, proceed with plans to remove the Biden-era extension of Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday. The case returned to the Supreme Court after the administration appealed a substantive lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to have broken the law by revoking the TPS for Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants. In a brief order, the majority of the court ruled that “although the posture of the case has changed [since May, when the Supreme Court stayed a preliminary injunction blocking Noem’s move], the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not.” Julianna Bragg reports for Axios; Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that there was a “realistic likelihood” that the indictment filed against Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia amounted to a vindictive prosecution by the Justice Department. The judge held that Abrego is entitled to discovery and requires an evidentiary hearing before the Court decides on his motion to dismiss his indictment. Alan Feuer reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION — LAWSUITS

A group of unions, higher education professionals, religious organizations, and others on Friday filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to charge a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, granted to skilled foreign workers. The lawsuit argues that Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally alter the visa program and that the administration did not go through the required regulatory process to institute the fee. Madeleine Ngo and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times.

A federal workers union on Friday filed a complaint suing the Trump administration over its insertion of blaming Democrats for the government shutdown into Education Department employees’ out-of-office email messages. The lawsuit argues that “Forcing civil servants to speak on behalf of the political leadership’s partisan agenda is a blatant violation of federal employees’ First Amendment rights.” Shannon Bond reports for NPR.

Over 200 international students whose visas were withheld by the Trump administration are suing the State Department to get their visas reinstated, according to court documents reviewed by the Hill. Surina Benkat reports.

The justices have so far granted a small list of petitions with employment and labor law implications, but are set to hear at least one dispute by November concerning the legal and constitutional protections that apply to prisoners or detainees who perform work.

The FTC case and equal protection challenges to states banning transgender girls and women from competing on female athletic teams are likely to have significant ripple effects in the labor and anti-bias legal arenas.

More cases are likely to come this term.

The high court is expected to ultimately review the merits of ongoing disputes over President Donald Trump’s unprecedented terminations of Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as mass firings of federal workers after the majority used its controversial “shadow docket” to greenlight those actions as litigation plays out.

Here’s how the upcoming Supreme Court term is kicking off for employment law:

Separation-of-Powers

The Trump administration’s push to topple a 90-year-old precedent and expand the White House’s power over federal agencies that previously operated outside of its direct control, including those regulating labor and employment, will take center stage in Trump v. Slaughter.

That case concerns a FTC Democratic member’s challenge to his termination. But it goes to the heart of the Supreme Court’s Humphrey’s Executor v. US decision, which upheld the constitutionality of job shields for FTC members by allowing only dismissals for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” and opened the door for similar safeguards for other independent agencies.

The administration hasn’t argued that Humphrey’s Executor must be overturned to justify Trump’s dismissal of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox and MSPB member Cathy Harris, who have tenure protections similar to those of FTC members. The US Justice Department claimed the justices’ 2020 Seila Law v. CFPB ruling suggests they’re not insulated by Humphrey’s Executor due to the executive authority they exercise.

Cases arising from the president’s recent firings raise novel legal questions. The high court’s final decision in Slaughter could offer precise guidance to lower courts on the scope of presidential removal power.

The case will be argued during the court’s December argument session, which begins Dec. 1 and ends Dec. 10.

Detainee Wage Case

Attorneys for Geo Group Inc. and a class of civil immigrant detainees will face off at oral arguments on Nov. 10 over whether the high court should allow the private prison operator to seek immediate appellate review of its derivative sovereign immunity defense.

GEO, which has a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract to run detention facilities, is accused of forcing detainees in Colorado to perform various jobs—including preparing food, operating the library, and doing laundry—or risk solitary confinement under a voluntary work program. They were paid just $1 per day, the suit said.

The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit last year upheld a district judge’s summary judgment ruling on GEO’s immunity defense, saying immediate review is unwarranted before the detainees’ underlying claims are addressed.

The justices now have an opportunity to resolve a split among eight federal circuit courts, five of which the private prison operator said foreclosed immediate review of district court orders blocking government contractors from raising a derivative sovereign immunity defense in litigation regarding their contracts.

A Supreme Court order mandating immediate circuit review of the legal defense, which allows government contractors to claim immunity that the US would have had if sued for the same actions, would benefit cases beyond the labor law context. But for detained immigrant workers, an additional procedural step in the litigation process would further extend the timeline for arguing the merits of their allegations in court, attorneys and prison labor scholars said.

GEO’s high court petition maintained that the justices need to clear up the circuit divide, as the legal path for litigants is currently unclear.

The underlying lawsuit is just one of several currently being litigated across the US for similar programs, and the question of whether state labor law applies to federal immigration detainees has been a novel issue.

Transgender Rights

High court cases Little v. Hecox and West Virginia Board of Education v. B.P.J. center on whether state laws banning transgender athletes from participating on female sports teams violate the US Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

A ruling in both disputes could significantly affect transgender rights in sports, but also potentially clarify the scope of anti-discrimination protections for gender identity in broader contexts like employment and education, court watchers said.

Transgender workers have invoked the Equal Protection Clause in discrimination cases, including a recent challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s retreat from transgender discrimination enforcement.

Last term, the Supreme Court declined to clarify the level of review for Equal Protection claims in transgender bias cases, but three conservative justices expressed that the more lenient rational basis applies, rather than “intermediate” scrutiny.

Asked on Sunday night when federal workers would be fired as he has threatened to do, Trump told reporters: ""It's taking place right now and it's all because of the Democrats.""

""The Democrats are causing the loss of a lot of jobs,"" Trump added, declining to answer a question about which agencies are subject to the cuts.

The possibility of layoffs would escalate an already tense situation in which Washington lawmakers have struggled to find common ground and build mutual trust. Leaders in both parties are betting that public sentiment has swung their way, putting pressure on the other side to cave.

Democrats are insisting on renewing subsidies to cover health insurance costs for millions of households, while Trump wants to preserve existing spending levels as he believes that Democrats will have to cave because of the jobs and federal projects being put at risk.

The squabble comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as Trump's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting last Monday.

""And, unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,"" Jeffries said. ""And what we've seen is negotiation through deepfake videos, the House canceling votes, and of course President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That's not responsible behavior.""

The Trump administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.

Even though it would be Trump's choice to cut jobs, he believes he can put the blame on the Democrats because of the shutdown.

""It's up to them,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday morning before boarding the presidential helicopter to celebrate the Navy's 250th anniversary in Norfolk, Virginia.

While Trump rose to fame on the TV show ""The Apprentice"" with its catchphrase of ""You're fired,"" Republicans on Sunday claimed that the administration would take no pleasure in letting go of federal workers, even though the administration had also put funding on hold for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic areas without clear signs of remorse.

""We haven't seen the details yet about what's happening"" with layoffs, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday morning on NBC. ""But it is a regrettable situation that the president does not want.""

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, also said the administration would prefer to avoid the layoffs.

""We want the Democrats to come forward and to make a deal that's a clean, continuing resolution that gives us seven more weeks to talk about these things,"" Hassett said on CNN. ""But the bottom line is that with Republicans in control, the Republicans have a lot more power over the outcome than the Democrats.""

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying on NBC that the possible increase in health care costs for ""millions of Americans"" would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a ""crisis.""

But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has stopped congressionally approved spending from being used. That essentially undermines the value of Democrats trying to seek compromises on the budget since the administration could block the spending of money from any deal. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in "" pocket rescissions "" on foreign aid, a process that meant the spending was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.

""We need both to address the health care crisis and we need some written assurance in the law - I won't take a promise - that they're not going to renege on any deal we make,"" Schiff said.

The television appearances indicated that Democrats and Republicans are busy talking, deploying internet memes against each other that have raised concerns about whether it's possible to negotiate in good faith.

Vice President JD Vance said a video putting Jeffries in a sombrero and thick mustache was simply a joke, even though it came across as mocking people of Mexican descent as Republicans insist that the Democratic demands would lead to health care spending on immigrants in the country illegally, a claim that Democrats dispute.

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for any federal health care programs, including insurance provided through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. Still, hospitals do receive Medicaid reimbursements for emergency care that they are obligated to provide to people who meet other Medicaid eligibility requirements but do not have an eligible immigration status.

The challenge, however, is that the two parties do not appear to be having productive conversations with each other in private, even as Republicans insist they are in conversation with their Democratic colleagues.

On Friday, a Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed to notch the necessary 60 votes to end a filibuster. Johnson said the House would close for legislative business next week, a strategy that could obligate the Senate to work with the government funding bill that was passed by House Republicans.

""Johnson's not serious about this,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on CBS. ""He sent all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How are you going to negotiate?""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Sunday that the shutdown on discretionary spending, the furloughing of federal workers and requirements that other federal employees work without pay will go on so long as Democrats vote no.

""They'll get another chance on Monday to vote again,"" Thune said on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

“Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,” Vice President JD Vance said Sept. 28 on “Fox News Sunday.”

President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and Republican members of Congress have repeated this line.

It’s wrong.

Democrats have refused to vote for Republicans’ resolution to extend the federal spending deadline, and their position does, in part, hinge on health care spending. Democrats want to extend covid pandemic-era Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back Medicaid cuts in the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law this summer.

The Democrats’ proposal wouldn’t give health care to immigrants who lack legal status; that population is already largely ineligible for federally funded health care. Instead, the proposal would restore access to certain health care programs for legally present immigrants who will lose access under the Republican law.

The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment for this fact check. Vance addressed criticism of his talking point in another interview by saying it was included in the Democrats’ spending proposal. It’s not.

A White House X account followed up with screenshots of the Democratic proposal repealing a section of the Republican law labeled “alien Medicaid eligibility.” It’s important to know that these changes would not give Medicaid access to immigrants who lack lawful status.

Vance defended his statement again in an Oct. 1 White House press conference, saying former President Joe Biden “waived away illegal immigration status” that helped migrants access federal assistance. It’s important to note that many people granted lawful status through humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status programs don’t automatically qualify for Medicaid; TPS recipients aren’t eligible, and many people who entered the U.S. on humanitarian parole are required to wait five years before accessing it.

The Trump administration has ended humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status for many people, rendering them ineligible for Medicaid and health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

We did not find evidence that Democrats want to spend “hundreds of billions” in costs for insuring migrants with unlawful presence.

Immigrants Lacking Legal Status Are Already Ineligible

Most federal health care dollars cannot be spent on health care for people in the U.S. who lack legal status. They cannot enroll in Medicaid or Medicare, and they are ineligible to purchase health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. A small Medicaid program reimburses hospitals for uninsured emergency care, which can include immigrants in the country without authorization but is not exclusive to them.

States such as California and Illinois expanded Medicaid coverage for people regardless of their immigration status, and the states pay for that. Federal law already banned states from using federal money for these programs. An earlier version of the Republican spending law would have penalized such states by withholding funding, but that provision didn’t last.

People in the country without permission might receive some federally funded health care in emergency cases; in those situations, hospitals must provide care even if a person is uninsured or in the country illegally. Emergency Medicaid covers hospital care for immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. The Republican tax and spending law reduced the amount hospitals can receive for emergency immigrant care.

Most Emergency Medicaid spending is used on childbirth. In all, it represented less than 1% of total Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2023, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

GOP Law Limited Care Access for Immigrants With Legal Status

The Republican tax and spending law made several changes to health care eligibility for immigrants living in the country with permission. An estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants are expected to lose their health insurance, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office projections.

Starting October 2026, the law will restrict eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to lawfully permanent residents, people from the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, or Palau who lawfully reside in the U.S. under an international agreement, and certain Cubans and Haitians.

Previously, a broad group, described as “qualified noncitizens,” was eligible for Medicaid and its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, including refugees and people granted asylum.

Some immigrants eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, such as lawful permanent residents, are required to wait five years before accessing the benefits.

The law also limited Affordable Care Act marketplace eligibility to the same group eligible for Medicaid and CHIP beginning Jan. 1, 2027. Previously, people who were described as “lawfully present” were eligible. That group included the “qualified noncitizens” eligible for Medicaid and people with short-term statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status or international students.

Beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, for immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization as children were previously eligible for Affordable Care Act coverage and its subsidies. They are ineligible since a Trump administration rule took effect in August.

Democrats’ Proposal Would Restore Legal Immigrants’ Access

The Democrats’ Sept. 17 budget proposal would, in part, permanently extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back billions in Republican cuts to Medicaid and other health programs.

The change would make Medicaid, CHIP, and Affordable Care Act coverage available to all legal immigrants who were previously eligible for it, such as refugees and people granted asylum.

The Democratic proposal would not broaden eligibility to federally funded health care programs to immigrants lacking legal status.

Vance said the Democratic policies would “give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,” and the White House did not offer its source for that figure. When Johnson was pressed to support a similar talking point, he referenced the Congressional Budget Office. The KFF analysis of CBO estimates found that the Republican law’s provisions related to legal immigrants would reduce federal spending by $131 billion; this projection did not include an estimate for people without legal status.

Our Ruling

Vance said, “Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens.”

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are largely ineligible for the federally funded health care programs Medicare and Medicaid, and they cannot seek coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace or apply for subsidies.

The Democrats’ budget proposal would not change that.

The Democrats want to restore access to certain health care programs to legal immigrants who will lose access under the Republican tax and spending law — among other measures aimed at making Medicaid and Affordable Care Act insurance plans easier to keep.

Their proposal would not grant federally supported health care benefits to people in the U.S. illegally, because they did not have access to them in the first place. The small amount of funding designated for Emergency Medicaid reimburses hospitals that provide emergency care to immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. Finally, we did not find evidence for Vance’s assertion that Democrats want “hundreds of billions” in health benefits for migrants in the country illegally.

Trump was asked via text message by CNN's Jake Tapper about shutdown talks. The Republican president responded with confidence but no details.

“We are winning and cutting costs big time,” Trump said in a text message, according to CNN.

His administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.

While Trump rose to fame on the TV show “The Apprentice” with is catchphrase of “You're fired,” Republicans on Sunday claimed that the administration would take no pleasure in letting go of federal workers, even though they have put funding on hold for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic areas.

“We haven’t seen the details yet about what’s happening” with layoffs, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on NBC. “But it is a regrettable situation that the president does not want.”

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said that the administration wants to avoid the layoffs it had indicated could start on Friday, a deadline that came and went without any decisions being announced.

“We want the Democrats to come forward and to make a deal that’s a clean, continuing resolution that gives us seven more weeks to talk about these things,” Hassett said on CNN. “But the bottom line is that with Republicans in control, the Republicans have a lot more power over the outcome than the Democrats.”

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying on NBC that the possible increase in health care costs for “millions of Americans” would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a “crisis.”

But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has withheld congressionally approved spending from being used, essentially undermining the value of Democrats' seeking compromises on the budgets as the White House could decline to not honor Congress' wishes. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in pocket rescissions” on foreign aid, a process that meant the spending was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.

“We need both to address the health care crisis and we need some written assurance in the law, I won’t take a promise, that they’re not going to renege on any deal we make,” Schiff said.

The television appearances indicated that Democrats and Republicans are busy talking, deploying internet memes against each other that have raised concerns about whether it's possible to negotiate in good faith.

Vice President JD Vance said that a video putting Jeffries in a sombrero and thick mustache was simply a joke, even though it came across as mocking people of Mexican descent as Republicans insist that the Democratic demands would lead to health care spending on immigrants in the country illegally, a claim that Democrats dispute.

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for any federal health care programs, including insurance provided through the Affordable Care Act.

The challenge, however, is that the two parties do not appear to be having productive conversations with each other in private.

On Friday, a Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed to notch the necessary 60 votes to end a filibuster. Johnson said the House would close for legislative business next week, a strategy that could obligate the Senate to work with the government funding bill that was passed by House Republicans.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Sunday that the shutdown on discretionary spending, the furloughing of federal workers and requirements that other federal employees work without pay will go on so long as Democrats vote no.

“They’ll get another chance on Monday to vote again,” said Thune on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

NICK EICHER, HOST: It’s Monday the 6th of October.

Glad to have you along for today’s edition of The World and Everything in It. Good morning, I’m Nick Eicher.

MARY REICHARD, HOST: And I’m Mary Reichard.

This is not just any old Monday. This is the first Monday in October, when the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court return to the bench for a new term.

EICHER: Here on Legal Docket, that’s a little like opening day in baseball, except it’s the playoffs, so it’s more like the opening faceoff for a new hockey season, but I digress.

What the First Monday brings is a fresh slate of cases and controversies, many that will bring rulings that will affect our daily lives.

REICHARD: Starting next week, we’ll have coverage of oral arguments so you can hear directly from the lawyers and justices. But today we’re looking ahead at some of the bigger disputes already on the docket.

EICHER: And for that, we’ve brought in all the senior partners in the firm Reichard, Rough, and West—WORLD’s legal reporters Jenny Rough and Steve West join us. Good morning to you both.

All three of the lawyers have prepared three cases each, matters they’ll be following closely this term.

REICHARD: So let’s get started. Jenny has the first case for us.

EICHER: She does. First up, Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections. This one involves the dreadlocks an inmate wears, or rather the dreadlocks he used to wear. Dreadlocks that were cut off against his will. The question is whether he can sue prison officials for damages under federal religious-liberty law. Jenny, what happened here, and why is this before the U.S. Supreme Court?

JENNY ROUGH: Damon Landor is a practicing Rastafari, so he took the Nazirite vow to not cut his hair. But as you mentioned, the prison officials cut it anyway. And the statute at play is known as RLUIPA, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Now there’s no circuit split in this case. Circuit courts have consistently said an inmate cannot sue individual prison officials for money damages under the federal law. But there is a Supreme Court case about a sister statute that has identical wording in its relief provision that says such lawsuits are allowed. So the court is going to have to thread that needle.

EICHER: If the Court were to side with Landor here, Jenny—if it opens the door to damages—how big could that be for other inmates?

ROUGH: Well, it could expand an inmate’s ability to sue under this federal law, but the law does fall within a certain context. But it would certainly be a strong deterrent to prison officials.

EICHER: Alright, number two Trump v. Slaughter. President Trump fired the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, and he fired her without giving a reason. Federal law says commissioners can only be removed for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance. So could you lay the facts out in this one..

ROUGH: Well, the president, as the head of the executive branch, has very broad powers to remove members of the executive branch. But as you mentioned, there’s a federal law, the Federal Trade Commission Act, that says a commissioner can only be removed for specific reasons. And Slaughter argues her removal was unlawful because none of those reasons existed.

EICHER: So I understand a lot of the case law here goes way back to the 1930s when the size of government really exploded.

ROUGH: Yeah, ninety years ago, the Supreme Court decided Humphrey’s Executor versus the United States. In a very similar set of facts, President Franklin D. Roosevelt fired Federal Trade Commissioner William Humphrey because Humphrey didn’t agree with the president’s policies. But the Court held that the president couldn’t do that because of the statute.

And the rationale at the time was that the commission’s job wasn’t purely executive. It included quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial tasks.

So jumping forward to the current case, the court wants answers to two questions: Does the federal statute’s removal protections violate the separation of powers? And if so, does Humphrey’s Executor need to be overturned?

But either way, it seems like the court will look at the role of the FTC and how it has changed over the years.

EICHER: Alright, Jenny, well the third one is Case v. Montana. In this one, police entered a man’s home without a warrant after a welfare call. So it’s a little bit different. He says that violated his Fourth Amendment rights. So could you walk us through how this case unfolded.

ROUGH: Yeah, and just a real quick reminder, the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. And it says search warrants must be based on probable cause. But there are exceptions.

So, it was actually William Cases’ ex-girlfriend called the police. She was on the phone with Case when she heard a pop and then silence, and he had been threatening suicide. So the police went to his house. Nobody answered. They entered. Case stepped out of a closet holding a dark object in his outstretched arm. And an officer shot him in the abdomen. And the dark object was a gun. So Case was arrested for assaulting a peace officer, but he now wants the gun and other evidence suppressed, saying police violated his Fourth Amendment rights by entering his house without a warrant.

So the question here is what standard applies for this emergency aid exception to getting a warrant. The traditional standard is probable cause that an emergency was unfolding, or is it a lesser standard like reasonable suspicion?

EICHER: So I guess, too, whether it makes a difference that this wasn’t a criminal investigation, but rather just a welfare check? That’s pretty key I would imagine.

ROUGH: That is such an interesting question, and it flags a tension that makes this case so hard. If police had been investigating Case for a crime, they would have needed probable cause. But because they were supposedly helping, they’re arguing the standard is lower. The Court has long said the home is entitled to the highest level of protection. So it kind of begs the question: Why would a criminal be entitled to greater protection than a person who needs help?

So the justices are going to have to wrestle with protecting the sanctity of the home, but at the same time, wanting police to be able to enter a house when a life is in danger.

EICHER: All right, Jenny, thanks so much time now to turn to Steve West. He's been watching several cases with First Amendment and executive power themes. Steve first up for you, Chiles v. Salazar. Colorado bars licensed counselors from engaging minors in what the state calls “conversion therapy.”

Colorado bars licensed counselors from engaging minors in what the state calls conversion therapy. So in this one, we see a Christian counselor saying that the state ban violates her free-speech rights because it allows therapists to affirm same-sex attraction or affirm a gender transition, but not to question any of those things. So talk a bit about that for us, Steve.

STEVE WEST: Well, Nick, the law actually says that it prohibits mental-health professionals from engaging in any practice or treatment, and that includes simply talking to a person that attempts or purports to change their minds about their sexual orientation or gender identity. So it’s like a lot of other laws that have proliferated around the country, whether they’re passed by states or local municipalities or counties.

It’s a speech ban. You can help an individual explore and even affirm their same-sex attraction or a gender not matching their sex, but you can’t help them become comfortable in their own sex or cope with their same-sex attraction.

So Kaleigh Chiles—she’s the counselor here—says this is a free-speech issue, that this is a ban of certain speech not approved by the state, whereas other speech is approved by the state. So it’s focused on the content of speech and therefore violates her free-speech rights.

EICHER: Well, there’s a pretty direct tie from this one to the next case, Steve—going from free speech and counseling to free speech and association in a different context, pro-life ministry.

This one is First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin. New Jersey’s attorney general had subpoenaed a pro-life pregnancy center, demanding donor lists and demanding internal records. The center says this is a clear violation of its First Amendment rights. So what is the state after here?

WEST: Yeah, first of all, just to clarify, the subpoena issued by the attorney general is an investigatory subpoena. It’s not a court subpoena. So it doesn’t have any power, in and of itself, to force the pro-life ministry here to disclose the identities of its donors or their other information—their names and addresses and that kind of thing.

So he has to go to court—state court—in order to get an order enforcing it, which is what the attorney general has done. And also, the pro-life ministry here has gone to federal court at the same time and asked for an order barring the state from getting this information.

And the federal court has deferred to the state and said the issue is not yet ripe for consideration, that you can certainly litigate your claims in state court. So what the case is about is which court can we be in, rather than the constitutional issue at this point at least.

EICHER: Well, Steve, Jenny had a case on presidential power, and you do too. This last one for you is Learning Resources v. Trump.

Two family-owned toy companies in this one are challenging tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They argue that Congress gave too much trade authority over to the President. So, Steve, go through the facts here for us

WEST: Yeah, these are two companies that import educational toys that are made in China and a few other countries that are affected by tariffs. The Constitution says Congress can assess tariffs, but Congress has also delegated some of that authority to the executive branch through this International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

And so it authorizes the President to take action to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States if he declares a national emergency—which is what President Trump has done in this case.

EICHER: And so on top of everything, it’s on an expedited schedule.

WEST: It is. It'll be heard In November—pretty quickly.

EICHER: Yeah, all right. Well, questions of free speech, donor privacy, and executive power. Steve, thank you very much.

WEST: You’re welcome.

EICHER:Well, Mary, you’ve been looking at three more cases, starting with a pair of them on women’s sports.

First up, West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Little v. Hecox.

So what are these about? I thought we’d settled these women’s-sports questions.

These two could answer some of the questions left open by the recent Skrmetti decision, right? (And while you’re at it, remind us what Skrmetti was about.)

REICHARD: Well, we haven’t. These two cases come out of West Virginia—obviously for one of them—the other one comes out of Idaho, which was the first state to pass laws protecting women’s sports and reserving female sports for females. There is a court split about whether those laws are constitutional. But this really is a big deal because twenty-seven states have something similar to the laws in these two states also protecting women’s sports.

EICHER: All right, so these two could answer some of the questions, I guess, left open by the recent Skrmetti decision. And maybe while you’re at it, tell us what Skrmetti was all about.

REICHARD: Yeah, be glad to. That was a six-to-three ruling that upheld Tennessee’s law banning medical intervention on minors suffering from gender dysphoria. So this is a really big deal affecting all those other states, and there is a court split whether these laws protecting women’s sports are constitutional, which is one reason SCOTUS took the case in the first place. And then one issue that remains is whether the “T” in the LGBT is a protected class, and that is hugely important.

EICHER: All right, so the justices here are going to have to decide what standard applies—what legal standard—whether it’s strict scrutiny or something else.

REICHARD: Yeah, bingo. You can recall we have three levels of scrutiny. We have rational-basis, which is really easy to meet; intermediate, a little bit harder; and then, as you say, strict scrutiny, which is the most difficult to overcome. And what classification we’re talking about determines which level of scrutiny we use. So here the justices will have to decide which level applies.

EICHER: Okay, so we have sports, we have equal protection, we’ve got money in elections—another perennial topic for the Court.

This one is National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC, the Federal Election Commission. It’s a campaign-finance case about how much coordination is permitted between political parties and their candidates.

So how are the Republicans framing up the argument here?

REICHARD: Well, like a lot of cases, it’s money, money, money. That’s what this is about. And the Republicans are arguing that this is a First Amendment-violation case. They say, “Hey, why limit parties like that when we have super PACs without any spending limits at all?” Political parties and candidates can coordinate their spending. There are limits in the law about how much you can donate to a campaign individually. So that’s what the Republicans say—that makes no sense at all.

EICHER:All right, your final case, Mary. It has to do with immigration and asylum.

This one is Urias-Orellana v. Bondi. That’s Pam Bondi, the attorney general. A man from El Salvador here fled after gang violence killed two of his brothers and threatened the rest of his family. He entered the U.S. He asked for asylum.

So walk us through this case. What is the Court being asked to decide

REICHARD: Yeah, it’s a technical legal question, and that is whether appellate judges have to defer to immigration courts on what persecution means under the law, or can appellate judges decide for themselves if the facts are indeed persecution. So it has a very particular meaning. We just don’t know what it is yet.

EICHER: So ultimately this dispute is over who makes the final call here, whether it’s an immigration judge or an appellate court.

REICHARD: That’s right, and we get a lot of cases like that. The facts are pretty dazzling, but the technical legal question—not so much. And this is one of them.

EICHER: All right, and that is this week’s Legal Docket. Jenny Rough, thank you.

ROUGH: Thank you. That was fun.

EICHER: And Steve West, thank you too.

WEST: Thanks Nick.

Millions more are living in vulnerable situations as stateless individuals, frequently unable to exercise even their most basic rights.

The population of displaced persons is larger than that of more than 220 countries and dependent territories. In other words, only 12 countries in the world have a population larger than 120 million people. As the UN High Commissioner for Refugees explains, “one out of every 67 people on the Earth” is displaced from their homes. More than “20 people are forced to flee every minute of every day” according to the International Rescue Committee. These figures do not even account for the day-to-day oppression that millions, if not billions, face but who are unable or reluctant to leave to seek a safe haven.

Most refugees in the world are either internally displaced in or are fleeing from the following countries: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Yemen.

As violence, war, and climate destruction affect more countries and regions of the world, the growing numbers of refugees and migrants could put a strain on social systems. National governments have responded to immigration flows in different ways, some limiting immigrants from entering their claimed territories and others welcoming newcomers. Just five countries — Iran, Turkey, Colombia, Germany, and Uganda — have welcomed almost 40% of the world’s refugees and others fleeing persecution and war.

The nation-state system has created the “refugee” and “stateless person,” as well as the severe problems associated with being considered outside the law or without “legal” status. All human beings are legal and have rights that should be respected wherever they live. Yet, due to violations of their human rights frequently perpetuated by or ignored by national governments, thousands of people flee their homes and countries every day trying to find safety, stability, and asylum.

By dividing up the world into 200 or so different countries, we have created “in” and “out” groups, with some achieving dignity, acceptance, inclusion, and rights fulfillment, and others being treated as less than human, unable to meet their basic daily needs. This disparity of treatment destabilizes society.

Why should our fellow humans have to flee to have their rights and basic needs upheld? Why are millions stuck in refugee camps with inadequate food, housing, healthcare, education, and opportunity?

To have the kind of world in which the rights reaffirmed in various declarations and treaties such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights are fully met, we should all be able to claim, and then exercise, our rights no matter where we happen to live on the planet. Human rights and duties are not bound by territory; they are not dependent upon the nation-state in which one happens to be born or where one happens to live.

Human rights are innate and unalienable; we are born with them, and we cannot give them up. We have them simply by being human.

What if we were to claim a citizenship that inherently affirms our rights wherever we find ourselves on planet Earth?

If everyone had citizenship everywhere, statelessness would no longer exist, and only natural disasters would forcibly displace people. With world citizenship, if we do not like where we live, if we do not like the politics or the rulers, then we could choose to live somewhere else, rather than being forced to flee for our safety and livelihood.

World citizenship, as a valid and legal citizenship beyond any other status that someone may carry, would ensure that everyone has at least one citizenship which, in its inclusiveness, upholds our concomitant rights and duties.

Requiring all governments to respect world citizenship status legally is the next step – a step that will support millions of displaced persons, by ensuring that governments will begin to fulfill their obligations to respect refugees, stateless and displaced persons’ innate and unalienable rights. To promote respect for this highest citizenship status, global institutions of law, such as a World Court of Human Rights and a World Parliament of the people, must be established.

World citizenship, as the highest level of allegiance, empowers us to focus on equity, justice, sustainability, unity, and harmony with each other and the Earth.

As long as we, the people of the world, allow the nation-state system to maintain the arbitrary and exclusive borders that divide humans from one another, immigration will continue to be viewed as a problem rather than as an educational, economic, political, and social opportunity. When we respect each other, our rights and duties, as world citizens, the entire earth will be a sanctuary of peace and safety for all.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/salah-darwish-hgS8njCYwP8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 02:56:25.836199

The ECHR and the Human Rights Act make little difference and the numbers relying on them are small.","This is the final of a series of articles from the Society of Labour Lawyers outlining the arguments and issues around the UK’s relationship with the European Convention on Human Rights. You can read the first here and the second here.

Why are the ECHR and Human Rights Act relevant to immigration? I thought they were just supposed to protect citizens, not foreigners with no right to be here.

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act apply to everyone, even asylum-seekers. However, they are not the first thing to which people turn to know where they stand. Just as fair trial rights existed for us in our common law before appearing in the Human Rights Act, so asylum policy is set by the UK government, with the Human Rights Act acting as a backstop check to make sure we have got it right.

The UK, as a liberal democratic state with the rule of law, does not tolerate torture or inhuman treatment. Our criminal law protects us from such things and we can bring civil claims against anyone who harms us like that. We don’t deport people to places where they will be tortured either. It’s part of our values. The Human Rights Act reinforces those values but does not create them.

READ MORE: What has the European Convention on Human Rights ever done for us?

The same goes for British citizens wanting to be joined by their foreign national family members such as a spouse or children. It’s our Home Office that sets immigration policy and can reject applications using the strong, muscular, definition of the public interest that Parliament provides. The ECHR and the Human Rights Act make little difference and the numbers relying on them are small. The rare cases that succeed usually involve British family members that need care or looking after. Even then, a foreign national with a criminal record may be refused in the public interest.

Doesn’t the ECHR/HRA mean that people wanting to come to the UK, or who have landed on small boats with dodgy asylum claims, or who are here illegally, can get round the immigration rules?

No. There are tough rules in place that ensure that people who cross the Channel may be sent back to France to have their asylum claims determined there. The new UK-France Treaty on preventing dangerous journeys means that France has to take them back when the UK asks. Those asylum-seekers that remain here get their claims processed here because like all democratic states in Europe, we abide by the Refugee Convention. We don’t send people back to counties where they face persecution or torture. Like all European democracies we are signed up not only to the ECHR but to the big UN global treaties on this as well.

Doesn’t the ECHR/HRA stop us deporting foreigners who have committed serious crimes because their child would miss chicken nuggets or because life is a bit tough back home?

No. The public interest dominates consideration of these issues by the Home Office and immigration judges. Where a UK-resident British citizen has a foreign national spouse or child and aspires to live with them in the UK there are demanding conditions, including a high-income threshold to be satisfied. Presently, an income of £29,000 is required to apply to bring in a spouse. Family life human rights provide a backstop for the small, residual number of hard cases or unusual cases for which the rules – being general in nature – make no provision.

There are also some cases concerning foreign nationals convicted of criminal offences who stand to be deported from the UK. Some of them seek to resist deportation as they have UK-resident family members, again typically, a British citizen spouse or child. It is these cases that tend to get media attention. In fact, Home Office policy and appeals law define the public interest at such a high level that almost all foreign national criminal claims fail.

Parliament has said in law that the deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest. It also states that the more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater the public interest in the deportation of that person. Foreign nationals given prison sentences on conviction face very high hurdles. Without a British citizen family member with care needs or who needs looking after, for whom it would be unjustifiably harsh or who has very compelling circumstances, foreign national criminals have very little chance of success. A case that might succeed is where a sick British citizen child needs her foreign national parent to look after her.

The numbers who succeed in an immigration appeal are tiny. A 2025 Bonavero Institute report estimates that the number of deportation appeals won on family life human rights grounds is about 2.5% of those deported. In the 15 months to June 2021 only 45 deportation appeals were allowed by an immigration tribunal on human rights grounds. That is not very many.

READ MORE: ‘Quitters never win – the problems with leaving the ECHR’

Great caution should be taken when reading media reports of a dislike of foreign chicken nuggets or an affection for a pet being the central issue in any cases. If such matters sound like a fantastical basis for deciding an immigration appeal, that is because in reality immigration appeals are not won on such grounds.

Didn’t the ECHR/HRA stop the Tories’ Rwanda plans? Could it stop Labour’s returns deal with France?

No. France is not Rwanda. Human Rights law stopped removal to Rwanda as there was a risk of the asylum seekers sent there being sent on to their home country where was a risk of ill-treatment or torture. The Labour government’s scheme to transfer asylum-seekers to France under the 2025 UK-France Agreement does not face the same hurdles. Like the UK, France applies ECHR human rights. It is also bound by EU asylum laws. Asylum-seekers in France can seek protection from French courts.

Aren’t appeals to the Strasbourg Court a way in which lawyers representing clients with dodgy cases can frustrate and spin out the process?

No. UK immigration cases barely feature there. UK domestic tribunals are where immigration cases end in all but a literal handful of cases. There is a right of petition to Strasbourg once domestic remedies have been exhausted. However, the chances of a successful outcome are miniscule. Only a small number of applications are made. Of those, the vast majority are filtered out at the admission stage, for example as being manifestly ill-founded.

In the tiny number of cases that progress to a full hearing, the UK government mostly wins. Since 1980 there have been only 29 UK deportation cases decided by the Strasbourg Court, of which the UK won 16. The reality is that the Strasbourg Court’s judgments make little difference.

If we left the ECHR and scrapped the HRA wouldn’t we be able to deport anyone we decided shouldn’t be here without pesky courts getting in the way?

No, it’s not that easy. There are other impediments such as the high cost of immigration detention and removal, the problems of documenting and securing the identity and nationality of persons, the role of our common law in fundamental rights protection, and the lack of effective re-admission co-operation by home states.

In any event, as already mentioned, the UK is a liberal democratic state with the rule of law. We do not tolerate torture or inhuman treatment. Our criminal law protects us from such things and we can bring civil claims against anyone who harms us like that. We don’t deport people to places where they will be tortured either.

The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat at odds with the Trump administration, says the state officers are simply keeping protesters safe from overzealous feds while protecting their First Amendment rights. But some demonstrators say Illinois troopers are now effectively shielding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement outpost in suburban Broadview.

Previously, disruptors have blocked access to the ICE facility, prompting federal authorities to use crowd-control methods, such as tear gas, to disperse mobs. Over the weekend, the Illinois State Police has been moving crowds back with wooden batons, herding them behind concrete barriers that are meant to keep the street clear.

Protesters like Ranell Conine told NewsNation they are confused by the disconnect between Pritzker’s public comments about the Trump administration and his use of state police to protect ICE.

“I think (Pritzker) needs to come and see the way that citizens are being treated and the way that our right to protest is being oppressed and challenged,” she said on Saturday.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said state authorities are not hiding behind masks in Broadview, in contrast with federal agents.

“They show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois,” the spokesperson said.

Tory plans announced on Sunday would see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.
The proposal is modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which the Conservatives said had provided a “successful approach” in removing illegal immigrants.
The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan” announced at the start of the party’s annual conference on Sunday.
Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.","The Conservatives will pledge to create a new ""Removals Force"", modelled on US immigration enforcement, which would be tasked with deporting 150,000 people a year as part of plans to detain and deport illegal immigrants.

The force would be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

Tory plans announced on Sunday would see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

The proposal is modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which the Conservatives said had provided a “successful approach” in removing illegal immigrants.

But ICE has also been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and US citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan” announced at the start of the party’s annual conference on Sunday.

Immigration is set to be one of the key themes of the annual gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre in Manchester.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system which would see refugee status granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants and arguing there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The plan follows the Tories’ announcement that they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it won the next election, arguing the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

It also comes as Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – that has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/1eAGm5cXqvdfm19D55VGfq/c056372af97df1cc03062fac2deb6384/PA-81876547.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80,N,,2025-10-06 00:56:52.798489

Gavin Newsom (D) said and the White House confirmed Sunday.

The big picture: The move, which Newsom says he'll sue over, comes the day after a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration's deployment of Oregon troops, saying the government had failed to prove immigration-related protests in the area couldn't be handled by local law enforcement.

The latest: While Newsom said 300 California National Guard members would be deployed, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told Axios Sunday evenining that about 200 troops would be sent from the state to Portland.

They're ""being reassigned from duty in the greater Los Angeles area"" to the city to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ""and other federal personnel performing official duties, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" he said.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield (D) said the state is ""preparing to take legal action"" over the move.

Driving the news: State and local officials have slammed Trump's directive to send federal troops into the city as unnecessary and dangerous.

Newsom said in a Sunday statement that the personnel are on their way now, calling the administration's action ""a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.""

""This isn't about public safety, it's about power,"" Newsom's statement continued. ""The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens.""

However, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to Axios: ""President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.""

Friction point: The bitter feud between Trump and the California governor was escalated this summer when the president mobilized thousands of Guard troops and hundreds of Marines in response to Los Angeles-area protests.

Earlier this year, Trump also sent Guard personnel into Washington, D.C. He'd repeatedly teased sending troops to Chicago — before eventually moving Saturday to call up 300 National Guard members in Illinois.

Catch up quick: U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, on Saturday granted a temporary restraining order that halted the deployment of Oregon National Guard members to Portland.

She noted in her order that the ""protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days—or even weeks—leading up to the President's directive"" and said Trump's ""determination was simply untethered to the facts.""

Soon after, the administration filed a notice of appeal to challenge the decision.

Local officials have pushed back on the administration's characterization of what's happened at demonstrations at a South Portland facility, saying they've been relatively small and easily handled by local police, Axios' Kale Williams reported.

What they're saying: Gov. Tina Kotek (D) said in a statement that her administration is aware of 101 Guard members who arrived in Oregon Saturday night and that they believed more were on the way Sunday. She added she had yet to receive any official notification from the federal government.

""The facts haven't changed,"" her statement read. ""There is no need for military intervention in Oregon. There is no insurrection in Portland.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said the administration's move ""circumvents the court's decision and threatens to inflame a community that has remained peaceful.""

The other side: Trump on Sunday said Immergut ""ought to be ashamed.""

He told reporters outside of the White House, ""I appointed the judge, and he goes like that."" Immergut is a woman.

Pritzker’s directive was issued Friday after reports emerged that armed federal immigration agents descended on an apartment building on the South Side of Chicago on September 30 and pulled men, women, and children from their beds in the middle of the night.

In an interview with CNN Sunday, the governor cited reports of “children who were zip-tied and held, some of them nearly naked” and “elderly people being thrown into a U-Haul for three hours and detained.” At least one U.S. citizen was detained, Pritzker added.

Federal agents were “just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Mr. Pritzker added.

Witnesses told WBEZ Chicago and the Chicago Sun Times that armed agents arrived at the five-story building with U-Hauls and broke down residents’ doors, dragging them out of bed. Some told CNN that a Black Hawk helicopter was flying above the apartment complex.

“Imagine being a child awakened in the middle of the night by a Black Hawk helicopter landing in your neighborhood,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Imagine an armed stranger forcibly removing you from your bed, zip-tying your hands, separating you from your family, and detaining you in a dark van for hours. This didn’t happen in a country with an authoritarian regime – it happened here in Chicago.”

Pritzker said he was “appalled” by the reports and that “military-style tactics should never be used on children.”

The Independent has asked the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Federal agents and officers with the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol, the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives were involved in the immigration raid. Authorities said the neighborhood where the raid was conducted was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates.”

Eboni Watson, a resident of the building, told WLS that children appeared “terrified” during the raid.

“The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught,” Watson said.

“I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” Watson added.

Approximately 37 people were arrested in the September 30 raid, some of whom had criminal records related to drug or weapons crimes, DHS said.

That’s what we intend to do.” Newsom has already clashed with the administration over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard in June in Los Angeles.
Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.","President Donald Trump’s clash with Oregon escalated after about 100 California National Guard members were deployed to the Pacific Northwest state, despite a court order holding that isolated protests in Portland did not justify the use of federalized troops.

The troops arrived Saturday night with no prior notice to state officials, and more troops are on the way, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek said in a statement Sunday.

Oregon officials said they were going to return to federal court Monday because the 14-day restraining order from US District Judge Karin Immergut only stopped the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops. The state’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a news conference that California was joining Oregon’s lawsuit to stop the deployment of the California Guard.

Troops were ordered to Illinois in a similar manner.

Rayfield and Kotek told reporters they hoped US District Judge Karin Immergut would rule Monday on their request, which is the same day the Trump administration is appealing her Saturday ruling.

“The president is trying to out-hustle us” in this process, Rayfield said.

The Trump administration has said that federalized troops are needed to protect immigration officers from protesters in Democratic-run cities, even as local officials said demonstrations have been modest and largely peaceful.

“There is no need for military intervention in Oregon,” Kotek said in the statement. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. Oregon is our home, not a military target.”

The move marks another dramatic escalation in Trump’s campaign to federalize law enforcement in Democratic cities, with his administration now trying to find ways around federal court orders. Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Memphis, with varying goals of protecting federal property and fighting crime.

Protests in Portland began in June when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents started arresting undocumented immigrants as they appeared in court for procedural hearings. The sporadic protests have focused on a single ICE facility outside downtown, a far cry from the often violent protests that rocked Portland during social-justice protests in 2020.

Nevertheless, Trump called Portland “war-ravaged” and said Sunday the city was “burning to the ground.”

Kotek countered that description on Sunday, noting that the protest was confined to one city block and that the Portland Marathon had occurred that day.

“Thousands of people running 26 miles through the streets of Portland — clearly not a war zone,” she said. “We cannot normalize the approach he is taking with the military in our country.”

The deployment of California troops to Oregon came hours after a Trump-appointed federal judge in Portland issued a strongly worded court order temporarily blocking the administration’s plan to call up 200 Oregon National Guard members to the state’s largest city.

Immergut concluded there was no justification for the deployment. She cited the limited nature of the protests and the ability of local law enforcement to handle the situation, which typically involved about 20 protesters at a time in recent weeks. The judge also said that the deployment risks “blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request to confirm the deployment, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Sunday that the federal government expects to win its appeal of the Portland judge’s order.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Jackson said. California Governor Gavin Newsom, she said, “should stand on the side of law-abiding citizens instead of violent criminals destroying Portland and cities across the country.”

Rayfield said Trump is falsely portraying Portland as a war zone to justify sending in federalized troops.

“This president is obviously hellbent on deploying the military in American cities, absent facts or authority to do so,” Rayfield said earlier in a statement. “It is up to us and the courts to hold him accountable. That’s what we intend to do.”

Newsom has already clashed with the administration over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard in June in Los Angeles.

“Despite a federal court order finding no legal basis to deploy state National Guard troops to the streets of Portland and ordering that control of the Oregon National Guard be returned to state command, the Trump administration is now sending 300 federally controlled members of the California National Guard to Portland to take their place,” Newsom said in a statement.

The judge said there were no facts to support Trump’s claims that Portland was “war-ravaged” and that anarchists and professional agitators were trying to burn down federal property and other buildings.

“The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

Immergut agreed that courts should give great deference to the president in making such decisions, but she disagreed that Trump had made his determination about Portland in good faith and ruled that deference “is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.”

Trump also ordered 300 National Guard troops to Illinois on Saturday on a similar rationale, over the objections of Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, who called the move “un-American.”

Illinois received no prior notice from the White House about the deployment, said a Pritzker spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity. The spokesperson added that the Illinois National Guard informed the Pentagon that the situation does not require the use of the military and reiterated its objection to the deployment.

The California National Guard was federalized in June for 90 days, when Trump first started using military troops to help combat what he claims is high crime and to protect federal agents carrying out his deportation actions. Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.

The Memphis deployment was conducted with the agreement of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.
