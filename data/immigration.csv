No, Mr. President, no kings, no dictators, no need for the National Guard in Chicago.

We don’t need Trump’s troops on our streets. What we need is investment in our neighborhoods, food on our tables, health care for our families and safety, rooted in justice and opportunity, in our communities. In fact, thanks to the investment in community intervention initiatives, Chicago’s rate of violent crime has fallen 22% this year to date; homicides are down more than 33% and shootings are down 38%. Similar declines have been observed in other Democratic-led cities, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C., that are also being threatened by Trump’s unlawful actions.

You can’t claim to protect people while stripping away the resources they rely on to survive.

Trump knows that. He knows there is no good reason to deploy the military inside the United States. For him, abusing the power of the National Guard is not about protecting public safety — it’s about control. It’s about threatening diverse, successful Democratic-led cities, like ours, that refuse to bow to authoritarianism.

Trump has repeatedly targeted cities that fight back against his power grabs and harmful, unconstitutional actions — whether by defending immigrants, protecting reproductive rights or standing against his disastrous economic policies like his tariffs. He has sought to use U.S. military power to retaliate against his political opposition, while creating a political spectacle that distracts from his unpopular and damaging policies.

We’ve seen this playbook employed before. Earlier this year, Donald Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to clear peaceful protesters standing up for their neighbors, against his violent immigration raids. Their actions didn’t quell unrest or de-escalate the situation — they inflamed tensions, instigated confrontation and created opportunities for the administration to violate Americans’ constitutional First Amendment rights.

So when Trump talks about “restoring order” with National Guard troops, let’s call it what it is: a suppression of dissent. An expensive, unlawful political stunt. A distraction from failed policies. An attempt to instill fear in the communities that have every right to protest.

Chicago is next on his list. But we will not be intimidated.

Chicago is the city of labor strikes, sanctuary movements and civil rights. We are home to freedom fighters, organizers and community caregivers. We know how to take care of one another — and we know how to defend our rights and communities.

This is not just about one city. It is not about politics. It’s about who we are as a nation.

From day one, this White House has done its best to make Chicagoans poor, sick, scared and silent. Trump and his administration have cut the very programs that keep our communities safe and help us thrive. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Justice Department froze and rescinded community violence prevention grants, undermining programs that were designed to interrupt cycles of gun violence in cities.

His 2025 budget proposes cutting $3 billion from Medicaid and reducing SNAP benefits for millions of working families, gutting access to health care and food for tens of thousands of Chicagoans. These aren’t luxuries; they are the foundation of public safety and community well-being. You can’t claim to protect people while stripping away the resources they rely on to survive.

Instead of stealing our resources and programs to provide trillions of taxpayer dollars to the ultrawealthy in tax breaks, Trump and his administration need to invest in our communities.

We see through the smoke and mirrors. The president’s harmful policies, combined with his use of fear-based propaganda and militarization, clearly reflect tactics commonly used by authoritarian regimes to silence dissent. But we will not be silenced nor will we bend the knee.

Combined with the National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Trump’s threat against Chicago desensitizes us to federal overreach. He is eroding our constitutional boundaries and normalizing the abuse of our military power so that he can succeed where he failed his first term: to undermine our democratic institutions, perpetrate a coup and hold our country hostage.

This is not just about one city. It is not about politics. It’s about who we are as a nation. When armed troops are sent into American communities to suppress protests, target civil society leaders or facilitate the disappearances of our neighbors, that is not just a local issue — it strikes at the core of our democracy. We cannot let this continue.

Everyone in local government, in the business community, in civil society and in Congress — regardless of political affiliation — needs to show courage, recognize the threat to our people, our freedoms and our democracy, and condemn Trump’s unlawful overreach before it becomes normalized. We need to speak out, to push back and to define the very values that have been laid out by our Constitution: the right to free speech, peaceful assembly and protection from government overreach. If this continues, we risk eroding the very rights that define what it means to be American.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250828-donald-trump-Delia-Ramirez-vl-421p-8d2af6.jpg",N,,2025-08-28 19:56:41.084147

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago, said Wednesday.

WATCH: Pritzker says alleged Trump plan to deploy military to Chicago is illegal and un-American

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Although details of the administration’s plans for Chicago are scarce, city leaders said Thursday that they are preparing for multiple possible scenarios, from troops assisting in immigration arrests to patrolling in the streets.

“We don’t want to raise any fears,” Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters. “We don’t want to create any speculation around what’s going on.”

Chicago leaders want more communication

City leaders said Thursday that the White House hadn’t contacted them about its plans, and a spokesman for the Illinois National Guard said the base hadn’t received requests regarding a Chicago mobilization.

Mogle, the base spokesman, said no decisions had been made on the request, and that the base hadn’t received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

DHS did not confirm whether it had asked to use the base. But it said in a statement Thursday that it was working to make “our streets and cities safe again.”

Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have pushed back against a possible mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn’t want or need the military’s help. They are planning to sue.

City leaders said workers were circulating know-your-rights cards in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, which offer tips on what to do in case of an encounter with an immigration agent. Other workers were checking in on Chicago’s homeless encampments and providing information about shelters since Trump has pushed to move homeless people far from Washington.

Snelling asked for more communication on plans involving law enforcement.

“To make sure that we’re not stoking fears through neighborhoods and we don’t have people running scared and it doesn’t create chaos on our streets, we’re willing to have those conversations,” Snelling said.

Many Chicagoans are on edge about the rumored deployment. Former President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago, weighed in Thursday, posting on X: “The erosion of basic principles like due process and the expanding use of our military on domestic soil puts the liberties of all Americans at risk, and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike.”

The politics of a deployment

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen and said there is no emergency in Chicago requiring military intervention. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he’s trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump.

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump’s second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump, who has zeroed-in on Democrat-led cities, have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

In recent days, the administration has been pointing out recent shootings in the city, including at Thursday’s White House press briefing when press secretary Karoline Leavitt listed crime statistics.

“This is JB Pritzker’s legacy, by the way,” she said.

Crime in Chicago

Violent crime has dropped significantly in Chicago in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem in parts of the city.

Chicago had a homicide rate of 21.7 per 100,000 residents in 2024, according to analysis of federal data by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Seven other major U.S. cities — St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Indianapolis and Richmond, Virginia — had higher rates than Chicago.

Still, Chicago reported 573 homicides in 2024, the most of any U.S. city that year. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of this year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22% compared with the first half of 2024.

In Illinois there are roughly 10,000 members of the Illinois Army National Guard and 3,000 Air National Guard. They routinely mobilize at armories around the state, including nearly a dozen in Chicago and its suburbs. But they are state-owed property and if the federal government mobilizes the Guard without the governor’s blessing, the armories aren’t available for use.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the DOJ agency that oversees the nation’s immigration courts, announced the change on Wednesday in a final rule scheduled for publication in the Federal Register the following day.

A Major Expansion of Authority

Under the rule, EOIR’s director, with Bondi’s approval, can “designate or select any attorney to serve as a temporary immigration judge” for six-month renewable terms. That means the department can bypass earlier restrictions limiting temporary appointments to former immigration judges, certain administrative law judges, or Justice Department attorneys with at least a decade of immigration law experience.

The department argued those restrictions were “needlessly narrow” and hampered efforts to manage an immigration court backlog that peaked at more than 4 million cases earlier this year.

“Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success as an IJ,” EOIR wrote in the rule, pointing to permanent judges hired without prior immigration law backgrounds who it says went on to become “exemplary” jurists.

Critics Warn of Politicization

The move has alarmed immigration advocates, who warn that it risks turning the courts into political instruments of the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.

“There is an attempt here to more quickly address the backlog of the immigration court and prioritize speed over justice,” Adriel Orozco, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, told GovExec. He cautioned that temporary judges, subject to renewal every six months, would feel “an added incentive to ensure they are meeting the expectations of leadership.”

The DOJ dismissed such concerns in the rule, calling accusations that new hires would not be neutral arbiters “unsupported”.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

Court System Under Strain

The administration is framing the rule as a pragmatic response to a crisis. Even after Congress authorized EOIR to hire up to 800 permanent judges by 2028, the agency says the backlog is too large to be resolved through traditional hiring alone.

Still, critics note that DOJ itself has worsened the staffing crunch by firing dozens of judges or pressuring them to leave since Trump returned to office.

Terminology Rollback

The final rule also rescinds several changes made under the Biden administration, striking the terms “noncitizen” and “unaccompanied child” from DOJ regulations and restoring the statutory language of “alien” and “unaccompanied alien child”. The department said the newer terms created confusion and were inconsistent with congressional usage.

The Bigger Picture

For Trump and Bondi, the new authority could accelerate deportation cases at a moment when the White House is leaning heavily on mass removal as a signature policy. With the backlog still hovering near record highs, immigration advocates see the rule as less about efficiency and more about consolidating executive power over who decides the fate of migrants in the United States.

“This is about control,” said one immigration lawyer who reviewed the rule. “If you can put any lawyer you want on the bench, you can stack the courts with people who will deliver the outcomes you want.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XyVn!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F843442e8-057d-4ee2-a1d3-31b276fce1d1_1500x1000.webp",N,,2025-08-28 18:56:32.653420

Lawmakers, led by the Democratic Socialist caucus, proposed a package of five bills to meet those goals at a press conference Thursday. Federal agents have used increasingly aggressive tactics to arrest immigrants as they seek to advance the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. In Wisconsin, ICE arrests have doubled under Trump with agents arresting an average of 85 people per month since January.

“The Trump administration is threatening our state’s fundamental values by commanding ICE and its agents to ignore due process, rip people from their communities and repeatedly violate basic human rights,” Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) said. The bills, he said, will implement “strong accountability measures so that all Wisconsinites, regardless of their background, are welcome and safe here.”

Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) said that most of the people being detained by the Trump administration aren’t criminals. According to ABC News, a recent report found that since late May, people with no criminal convictions and no pending criminal charges have started to make up an increasing percentage of those arrested by ICE.

“The vast majority have been people who pose no public threat,” Ortiz-Velez said. “They are the essential workers that put food on our tables, milk the cows and keep the meat factories operating. They build our homes, and they’re our neighbors, and they’re our friends.”

Republicans, who hold majorities in the Senate and Assembly, would be necessary for the bills to advance.

Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said it’s unlikely Republicans will sign on.

“We hope that our Republican colleagues will work with us on common-sense legislation, especially when the stakes are this high, but no, I don’t anticipate any support from our Republican legislative colleagues on this,” Clancy said.

Republicans introduced a bill earlier this year that would require local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE. It passed the Assembly in March.

One of the bills in the Democratic package is a measure introduced earlier this year by Ortiz-Velez to do the opposite by prohibiting cooperation of law enforcement with ICE

Another bill would require law enforcement officers to identify themselves when arresting someone including making their name and badge number visible, providing the authority for arrest or detention and prohibiting them from covering their face or wearing a disguise. Face coverings would be allowed if worn for safety or protection.

Violations would be a Class D felony and carry a penalty of maximum $100,000 fine.

Leaders of the Department of Homeland Security have said agents are covering their faces to protect themselves from doxing and threats, according to NPR.

“It’s not normal for any law enforcement officer, any agency to wear masks and hide their identity, nor is it safe,” Ortiz-Velez said. “No exception should be made here.”

One bill would prohibit state employees and police officers from aiding in the detention of someone if the person is being detained on the “sole basis that the individual is or is alleged to be not lawfully present in the United States.” The bill would also prohibit law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin from participating in 287(g) agreements.

The federal 287(g) program provides the opportunity for state and local law enforcement agencies to partner with ICE, allowing local officers to perform certain immigration-related duties, including identifying, processing and detaining removable immigrants in local jails.

According to the ACLU of Wisconsin, there are 13 counties in Wisconsin as of the end of July that formally participate in the program. Several have joined this year including Kewaunee, Outagamie, Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood.

“It’s important to remember as we’re here at the state capitol that Wisconsin has shown strong opposition to policies like 287(g),” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director and co-founder of Voces de la Frontera, a nonprofit immigrant rights organization.

Neumann-Ortiz noted that in 2016 thousands protested immigration legislation that Republicans were proposing at the time, and it ultimately failed.

“People can make the change,” Neumann-Ortiz said.

Another bill would prohibit state and local facilities from being used to hold detained immigrants and would prohibit funds from being used to establish new immigrant detention facilities. The bill’s co-author, Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire), called it “the Communities, Not Cages” bill.

“Over the past eight months, my constituents have stopped me at events and contacted my office and shared personal stories of fear and horror that grows and comes with watching the Trump regime abduct, detain and deport people they perceive to be immigrants without due process without accountability, often without even showing their faces,” Phelps said. “Our constituents in every corner of the state wish for us to be welcoming, safe and humane — a state that invests in communities and not in cages.”

The final bill would establish a grant program run by the Department of Administration for community-based organizations in Wisconsin to support them in providing civil legal services to people and families in immigration matters.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250828_150121367-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 18:56:41.968818

The new guidance permits officers to arrest their “target” at courthouses, as well as noncitizens, such as “family members or friends accompanying the target alien to court appearances or serving as a witness in a proceeding.” Masked federal agents now routinely roam the hallways of courthouses, abducting people as they leave immigration appointments and hearings.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-28-immigration-court-nyc.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 18:56:45.639230

Md.) against all 15 judges in that same court, seeking to block a standing order issued by that court that gives every alien facing removal who files specified papers an automatic stay from deportation. On August 26, Judge Thomas T. Cullen of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia (W.D. Va.) issued an opinion dismissing that complaint — while offering a roadmap for DOJ to follow to achieve its goals.

“Standing Orders”

As the Committee on Rules and Practice of the Judicial Conference of the United States (the latter being “the national policymaking body for the federal courts”) has explained:

For years, judges and lawyers have been concerned about the proliferation of “standing orders[]” ... in the federal district courts. The term ""standing orders"" describes orders — including ""administrative orders"" or ""general orders"" — adopted by district courts or bankruptcy courts as district-wide or division-wide orders, without an opportunity for notice or public comment.

Those ”concerns” are that local standing orders undermine uniformity across the 94 federal district courts (“undermining consistency in areas where the national rules were meant to provide it and creating traps for the unwary and even for the wary”); they are promulgated without public input; they are hard to find; and that there are variations of such orders between different districts and even different judges.

In most law schools, students spend two semesters on the national rules of federal court procedure (and even then, only get a handle on them in practice), so you can imagine the complexity added by local rules — not that I expect anyone to have sympathy for lawyers.

Amended Standing Order 2025-01

The standing order in question is Amended Standing Order 2025-01, issued by the D. Md. on May 28.

It’s a slightly different version of a standing order (Standing Order 2025-01) issued by Chief Judge George L. Russell III on May 21 that I analyzed on May 27. There’s not much difference between the two orders, and the flaws I identified in the first iteration carried over to the amendment.

Most saliently, both enjoin and restrain DHS for two business days from removing any alien who properly files a petition for writ of habeas corpus and other information with the D. Md.

The court apparently doesn’t think that a two-day delay makes much difference, but then the judges on that court don’t have much experience in immigration, either.

That’s not a dig at the esteemed jurists on the D. Md.; as Judge Cullen notes in his first footnote in his opinion, “Congress has limited the authority of federal district courts to review immigration matters”, and consequently they rarely get into the nuts and bolts of the process.

In practice, however, DHS must have three things to physically remove an alien under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA): (1) an order of removal; (2) a travel document issued by the country of removal; and (3) a plane ticket or a seat on a chartered flight out of the United States.

Removal orders are evergreen (unless and until they are reopened, reversed, or rescinded), but travel documents are often issued for limited windows of time, plane tickets expire, and vacant seats on charters are a waste of taxpayer’s money.

In other words, this isn’t a simple issue of executive branch peevishness in response to a standing order that forces them to wait a few days.

“Judicial Review”

Nor is district court review necessary from a due process standpoint in any but the most exceptional cases.

That’s because Judge Cullen could not have been more correct in his initial footnote: Congress twice — in 1996 and again in 2005 — amended section 242 of the INA to cut the district courts out of the judicial review process for final orders of removal.

That’s not to say aliens under final orders aren’t entitled to seek judicial review of administrative removal orders. As I explained in May:

In section 106 of the REAL ID Act of 2005 ... Congress amended the judicial review provisions in section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to channel aliens’ challenges to final removal orders away from the district court to the U.S. Courts of Appeals.

Specifically, section 242(g) of the INA provides:

Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter. [Emphasis added.]

Section 242(a)(2) of the INA eliminates all court review of certain issues (like denials of some forms of discretionary relief), but otherwise section 242(b) allows aliens to file a “petition ... with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings” within 30 days to seek judicial review of their removal orders.

There are rare cases in which a district court could properly review an alien’s claim, but when it comes to most alien claims, Congress deliberately cut district courts out of the process entirely.

The “Rare Case” of Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Which brings me to the “rare case” of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

I will spare you the extensive legal analysis of that case (which you can find elsewhere), to note that in March, Abrego was (1) under a final order or removal; that (2) permitted DHS to remove him to any country other than El Salvador, from which an immigration judge in 2019 (in a truly convoluted order) granted him “statutory withholding of removal” under section 241(b)(3) of the INA.

Of course, Abrego was living in Maryland when DHS arrested him in March and summarily removed him to the one country it allegedly couldn’t, El Salvador.

DOJ later admitted it removed Abrego “in error”, but not until after Abrego’s family filed suit with the D. Md. to have him returned to the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Paula Xinis, and let’s just say that after she ordered the government to return Abrego, she wasn’t happy with either the speed or the manner with which the government complied with her order.

I have no insight into the deliberations that preceded the issuance of either of these standing orders, but it’s not much of a stretch to conclude Abrego’s case precipitated both.

Having handled immigration cases over the course of decades, I can tell you that while such erroneous deportations occur, they are few and far between. When aliens are erroneously deported, the State Department almost always locates the alien and DHS gives the alien a travel document back and allows the alien to return.

The government’s compliance with Judge Xinis’s return order in Abrego’s case was complicated by the fact that as soon as he landed in El Salvador, the Salvadoran government immediately took him into custody and put him in prison.

Usually, when aliens are deported home, they are admitted and hit the street. But that’s not what happened in Abrego’s case, and nowhere in any of the thousands of barrels of ink that has been spilled about his case has anyone asked why he was detained in El Salvador.

The popular consensus is that the Trump administration asked El Salvador to detain him, but respectfully, that doesn’t make any sense: So long as he’s not in this country, who cares where he goes or whether he’s free or detained abroad?

That suggests the Salvadoran government decided on its own to detain him, but regardless, Abrego’s return in accordance with Judge Xinis’s order required a diplomatic negotiation between Washington and San Salvador.

Still, the inescapable conclusion is that the D. Md. treated Abrego’s removal as the rule, not the wild exception that it was, which is why it issued these two standing orders.

Judge Cullen’s Order

Because all 15 judges on the D. Md. were defendants, they were all recused from hearing the case, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit tapped Judge Cullen of the W.D. Va. to hear the matter.

His order dismissing the DOJ complaint is 37 pages long, but overly simplistically, it comes down to his conclusion that the judiciary and the executive are equal branches of government and there’s no mechanism in law or precedent that allows disputes between the two to be resolved in this manner.

But that’s not to say that his order is a ringing endorsement of the standing orders, either. As he explained:

According to the Executive, the standing orders are unlawful for three principal reasons. First, the Executive argues that they are inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because they automatically afford injunctive relief only to a special class of litigants (i.e., removable aliens) without requiring those litigants to satisfy the prerequisites for this type of equitable relief. Second, the Executive contends that the standing orders are ultra vires — or beyond the power of the court — given the limited statutory authority of district courts to review immigration matters. Third, the Executive submits that, in issuing the orders, the District of Maryland violated well-established procedures for promulgating local rules of court.

Fair enough, as far as it goes.

The Proper Forum

He continued, noting that “If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” while clarifying that the proper forum was not the D. Md. but rather the appellate Fourth Circuit, either on a direct appeal of one of the habeas cases the orders focus on or “by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules”.

The statute governing federal courts’ rulemaking power, 28 U.S.C. § 2071, states at clause (c)(1) that, “A rule of a district court ... shall remain in effect unless modified or abrogated by the judicial council of the relevant circuit”, while 28 U.S.C. § 332(d)(4) gives those judicial councils authority to “periodically review” rules established by the district courts and abrogate any rule “found inconsistent”.

Of those two choices, a direct appeal seems to me to be preferable as it would get these standing orders to the Supreme Court for review most expeditiously. Whether DOJ listens to Judge Cullen, however, is an open question.

A “More Confrontational Path”

Finally, the judge complains that instead of either of those options, DOJ “chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely”, adding in a footnote:

Indeed, over the past several months, principal officers of the Executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as “left-wing,” “liberal,” “activists,” “radical,” “politically minded,” “rogue,” “unhinged,” “outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,” “[c]rooked,” and worse. Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.

It would be ideal if the three branches of our federal government treated one another with the highest degree of respect and courtesy, but let’s not forget that President Jefferson and Chief Justice Marshall were not only the heads of their respective branches but also second cousins, and yet fought like cats and dogs.

And while castigating the executive branch, perhaps Judge Cullen should look at how Trump’s been treated by his own circuit.

In writing for the majority of the Fourth Circuit its June 2017 opinion in Trump. v. International Refugee Assistance Project, then-Chief Judge Robert Gregory complained that Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 13780 (the second so-called “travel ban”) “in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination”, while his colleague, Judge Andrew Wynn, in concurrence described the EO as “naked invidious discrimination against Muslims”.

That language prompted Judge Paul Niemeyer, writing for himself and two other judges in dissent to take Judges Gregory and Wynn to task, asserting their “opinions ... betray an object beyond a disciplined analysis” and that their “statements flatly mischaracterize an order that undisputedly contains no facial reference to religion”.

“Politics Ain’t Beanbag”

As the saying goes, “politics ain’t beanbag”, and the more judges delve into political questions reserved to the other branches, the more likely they are to learn that truism.

For now, Maryland U.S. district court judges can keep blocking removal orders despite limits on their jurisdiction in section 242 of the INA, but maybe it’s time for the Supreme Court to revisit the language of the act and keep the courts in their proper lane.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/judge-gavel-warrant-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 19:57:41.904974

What Cities Are Considered Sanctuary Cities?
Panic stricken Governor Pritzker says that crime is under control, when in fact it is just the opposite.","The Trump administration plans to intensify immigration enforcement in five major U.S. cities, including Chicago, where federal officials are considering using a naval base as an operations hub.

Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that a ""large contingent"" of resources will be sent to Chicago. He also said there will be a ""ramp up"" of operations in sanctuary jurisdictions that ""refuse to work with ICE.""

""You can see a ramp up of operations in Chicago, absolutely,"" Homan said. ""You're going to see a ramp up of operations in New York. You're going to see a ramp up of operations continue in L.A. and, you know, Portland, Seattle.""

Why It Matters

The announcement follows President Donald Trump's renewed criticism of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker over crime in Chicago, suggesting the city's leadership is failing to protect residents. Trump said the federal government stands ready to intervene, while Homan confirmed ongoing discussions about expanding ICE's footprint near the city.

""Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend. 20 people were shot. But he doesn't want to ask me for help. Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren't capable of doing. STAY TUNED!!!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.

What To Know

Officials at Naval Station Great Lakes said they received a request from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeking ""limited support"" for ICE, The Washington Post reported.

If the request is granted, the base would provide ""facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs,"" defense officials said in a statement obtained by the outlet.

Pritzker told reporters on Wednesday that he was not contacted about the request.

""They don't seem to want to communicate at all. And that's odd because it sounds like what they're trying to do is march right over local police,"" Pritzker said.

What Is a Sanctuary City?

Earlier this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) described sanctuary jurisdictions as ""states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

What Cities Are Considered Sanctuary Cities?

The DOJ published a list of sanctuary jurisdictions earlier this month. The cities listed were Albuquerque, New Mexico; Berkeley, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; East Lansing, Michigan; Hoboken, New Jersey; Jersey City, New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Paterson, New Jersey; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; Rochester, New York; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco City, California.

What People Are Saying

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker told reporters: ""You know, we used to hear that the president of the United States supported local police. We support local police. But now it appears that he wants to ignore them all together and just do whatever he has a whim about on that day.""

President Donald Trump, on Truth Social: ""A really DEADLY weekend in Chicago. 6 DEAD, 27 HURT IN CRIME SPREES ALLOVER THE CITY. Panic stricken Governor Pritzker says that crime is under control, when in fact it is just the opposite. He is an incompetent Governor who should call me for HELP. Mayor Johnson is no better. Make Chicago Great Again!""

Border czar Tom Homan told reporters: ""We're going to take the assets we have and move them to problem areas like sanctuary cities, where we know for a fact they're releasing public safety threat illegal aliens to the streets every day.""

What Happens Next

No decision has been made yet on the request from the DHS regarding Naval Station Great Lakes, The Washington Post reported.

I write with deep gratitude for your solidarity during my recent detention. In moments when my freedom was stripped from me, your support reminded me that I was not alone, that my voice still carried, and that the struggle for justice is larger than any one of us.

For 104 days, I was unlawfully detained by U.S. immigration authorities in rural Louisiana and separated from my family and my community for speaking out against the genocide of my people. The support of communities from around the world is what kept me going. You kept me going. Thank you for raising your voices when I was detained and separated from my family.

My release is not the end of this story. Many others remain behind bars – immigrants, refugees, and activists who, like me, were torn from their families by the Trump administration’s cruel machinery of suppression, detention, and deportation. Their names are less visible, their stories less told, but their suffering is no less real. I ask that we continue to hold them in our collective conscience and fight for their freedom.

My detention was political. It was an attempt to silence me for speaking openly about Palestinian rights, for refusing to let the daily reality of occupation, apartheid, forced starvation and mass killing be normalized. But repression does not weaken conviction, it strengthens it. I will not back down. The fight for Palestinian liberation is inseparable from the global struggle for justice, dignity, and human rights that Amnesty International has long championed.

Thank you for standing with me, not only in my personal ordeal but in the broader struggle that connects all of us. Though powerful forces are trying to discredit, dehumanize and erase us, we must continue our work together.

Many Palestinians across the occupied territories and across the world are still suffering. Families are still struggling to survive. Children are still being starved. Lives are still being destroyed.

Associated Press

SEATTLE (AP) — Immigration advocates gather like clockwork outside Seattle’s King County International Airport to witness deportation flights and spread word of where they are going and how many people are aboard. Until recently, they could keep track of the flights using publicly accessible websites.

But the monitors and others say airlines are now using dummy call signs for deportation flights and are blocking the planes’ tail numbers from tracking websites, even as the number of deportation flights hits record highs under President Donald Trump. The changes forced them to find other ways to follow the flights, including by sharing information with other groups and using data from an open-source exchange that tracks aircraft transmissions.

Their work helps people locate loved ones who are deported in the absence of information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which rarely discloses flights. News organizations have used such flight tracking in reporting.

Tom Cartwright, a retired J.P. Morgan financial officer turned immigration advocate, tracked 1,214 deportation-related flights in July—the highest level since he started watching in January 2020. About 80% are operated by three airlines: GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo Airlines. They carry immigrants to other airports to be transferred to overseas flights or take them across the border, mostly to Central American countries and Mexico.

Cartwright tracked 5,962 flights from the start of Trump’s second term through July, a 41% increase of 1,721 over the same period in 2024. Those figures including information from major deportation airports but not smaller ones like King County International Airport, also known as Boeing Field. Cartwright’s figures include 68 military deportation flights since January—18 in July alone. Most have gone to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

The work became so demanding that Cartwright, 71, and his group, Witness at the Border, turned over the job this month to Human Rights First, which dubbed its project “ICE Flight Monitor.”

“His work brings essential transparency to U.S. government actions impacting thousands of lives and stands as a powerful example of citizen-driven accountability in defense of human rights and democracy,” Uzrz Zeya, Human Rights First’s chief executive officer, said.

The airlines did not respond to multiple email requests for comment. ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which would not confirm any security measures it has taken.

La Resistencia, a Seattle-area nonprofit immigration rights group, has monitored 59 flights at Boeing Field and five at the Yakima airport in 2025, surpassing its 2024 total of 42.

Not all are deportation flights. Many are headed to or from immigration detention centers or to airports near the border. La Resistencia counted 1,023 immigrants brought in to go to the ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington, and 2,279 flown out, often to states on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“ICE is doing everything in its power to make it as hard as possible to differentiate their contractors’ government activities from other commercial endeavors,” organizer Guadalupe Gonzalez told The Associated Press.

Airlines can legally block data

The Federal Aviation Administration allows carriers to block data like tail numbers from public flight tracking websites under the Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed program, or LADD, said Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for FlightRadar24.

“Tail numbers are like VIN numbers on cars,” Gonzalez said.

Planes with blocked tail numbers no longer appear on websites like FlightRadar24 or FlightAware. The tracker page identifies these them as “N/A – Not Available” as they move across the map and when they are on the tarmac. Destinations and arrival times aren’t listed.

Carriers have occasionally used LADD for things like presidential campaigns, but in March, FlightRadar24 received LADD notices for more than a dozen aircraft, Petchenik said. It was unusual to see that many aircraft across multiple airlines added to the blocking list, he said. The blocked planes were often used for ICE deportations and transfers, he said.

Of the 94 ICE Air contractor planes that La Resistencia was tracking nationwide, 40 have been unlisted, Gonzalez said.

Similar things happened with the call signs airlines use to identify flights in the air, Gonzalez said.

Airlines use a combination of letters in their company name and numbers to identify their planes. GlobalX uses GXA, for example. But in the past few months, the ICE carriers have changed their regular call signs, making it more difficult to locate their immigration activates, he said.

Cameras at Boeing Field help volunteers track flights

King County International Airport is one of the few sites in the country where passengers can be seen getting off and on the planes, thanks to county-operated cameras. Volunteers gather each time a flight arrives to count each person and note whether they struggle on the stairs or appear to have health issues.

ICE Air operations at Boeing Field started in 2011. The county set up cameras on the tarmac in 2023 after King County Executive Dow Constantine, having unsuccessfully tried to stop the ICE flights, issued an order requiring the county to track them at the airport. The county publishes monthly statistics on them.

The cameras record immigrants arriving on buses, being searched and being led up the stairs onto the planes. On Tuesday, one man who was hunched over shuffled down the bus’ stairs and across the tarmac using a cane, then an officer helped him climb onto the plane, one step at a time.

Detainees must navigate the plane’s stairway with their ankles chained together. Their wrists are also chained, and those cuffs are connected to a chain around their waist, so they can’t raise their arms, hold the railing or take big steps, activist Stan Shikuma told the AP.

The video can be viewed live on a giant screen in a nearby building where advocates can watch people being taken off buses from the ICE Northwest detention center. It’s also livestreamed on the county website.

“They’re patted down, head to toe, mouth examined, sometimes the chains are tightened before they’re allowed to board the plane,” Shikuma said. “People coming off the plane: same treatment.”",https://nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deportation-flight_Featured.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 19:56:57.031993

This is especially true for people who are trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming, unhoused, and experiencing mental health crises.
Reimagining a world beyond ableism, trans-phobia, and anti-Black racism requires us to move funds away from policing and towards robust community-based mental health services that don’t require law enforcement involvement for people to access crisis mental health care.","The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) condemns law enforcement targeting and killing of disabled people and calls for solidarity from the disability community and justice for all those impacted. DREDF honors the lives of all disabled people targeted and killed by police, including Linda Becerra Moran and Victor Perez, and demands justice in the wake of their murders at the hands of the police.

Since January, the rhetoric and actions of this administration have sought to dehumanize and limit the rights of people with disabilities through executive orders and statements. Just recently, President Trump began an attempted takeover of Washington, DC’s police force and has militarized and exponentially increased law enforcement presence targeting unhoused people, people with mental illness and immigrants. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed actions limiting access to essential mental health, early education and healthcare for some immigrants will disproportionately harm brown disabled people.

Policing and government intrusion do not belong in our response to mental health crises, our schools, our hospitals, our communities, our homes, or our families. Reducing police and immigration enforcement interaction with Black and brown people with disabilities and increasing community-based supports and services are imperative for keeping our communities safe from state violence.

Linda Becerra Moran was a 30-year-old trans woman, Ecuadorian migrant, and primarily spoke Spanish. She lived in Los Angeles and experienced cycles of being unhoused while looking for consistent work as a cook. Victor Perez was a 17-year-old autistic, nonverbal, teenager of Puerto Rican descent with an intellectual disability and cerebral palsy. He primarily understood Spanish and lived with his family in Idaho.

On February 7, 2025, Linda called 911 for help. She described that she had endured gender-based violence and was currently experiencing a mental health crisis. Despite naming that she was experiencing a mental health crisis, police were dispatched to the scene instead of crisis intervention specialists. The police who responded neither listened to Linda nor provided her with mental health services. Instead, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) not only escalated her mental health crisis, but shot Linda within minutes of arriving. Linda died on February 27th after being taken off of life support.

On April 5, 2025, the police were called to the home of Victor’s family, where the family was having a barbeque. The police approached the gathering with guns already drawn despite being on the other side of the fence from Victor and his family. Multiple officers shot Victor within seconds of arriving on the scene. He died on April 12th after being taken off life support.

On August 11, 2025, U.S. Border Patrol agents handcuffed a 15-year-old disabled child outside of a Los Angeles school because of mistaken identity. On June 8, 2025, the Disabled Ginger called attention to the cruel and inhumane treatment of disabled immigrant detainees Alma Bowman and Rodney Taylor.

Alongside their loved ones and communities, we grieve and rage over the deaths and targeting of Linda Becerra Moran, Victor Perez, Alma Bowman, Rodney Taylor, and many more people with disabilities[1], particularly Black disabled people, who have been disproportionately detained, criminalized, imprisoned, and murdered by law enforcement.

These instances of violence are not the exception for Black and people with disabilities—they are the rule. This is especially true for people who are trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming, unhoused, and experiencing mental health crises. In the words of Talila A. Lewis:

“policing in the united states was originally developed and later honed to control Black and Indigenous people’s lives — our movement, labor, speech, ownership, family, and more — most are unaware that disabled people (and those labeled disabled) have always been primary among the carceral machine’s intended target.”

We cannot rely on a system to keep us safe that was built on white supremacy and designed to oppress and dehumanize Black, brown, trans, queer, and disabled communities. Disability and racial bias trainings for police are not enough.[2] Trainings have not and will not reduce police violence against disabled Black and Brown people. We must continue to support and advocate for community-led public safety efforts that are geared towards reducing police interactions to keep our Black and brown, trans, immigrant, unhoused, immigrant, and disabled community members safe.

In 2024, DREDF joined 27 other disability rights and advocacy organizations in a public call for eliminating the role of police in responding to situations that should be addressed by peer led service systems, rooted in a framework of disability justice. Any advocacy for eliminating the role of police involvement and preventing violence against people with disabilities must be led by people who are most impacted by police violence: Black, brown, and Trans people with disabilities, especially people who are formerly incarcerated, have come in contact with the criminal legal system or carceral state, have mental health conditions, or are currently or at risk of being unhoused.

We must reimagine the ways that our mental health and community safety services operate. Investing and participating in local mutual aid networks allows our communities to create solutions and provide resources that work for us without violent police involvement.

Reimagining a world beyond ableism, trans-phobia, and anti-Black racism requires us to move funds away from policing and towards robust community-based mental health services that don’t require law enforcement involvement for people to access crisis mental health care.[3] We must hold law enforcement personally accountable for violence and harm by abolishing qualified immunity, which denies justice to all victims of the violence of policing. Disability Justice also calls for us to eradicate all systems and places where marginalized people are disappeared and separated from their families and loved ones.

During this political moment, where we are faced with a rise in state-targeted efforts to erase and disappear Black, Brown, immigrant, trans, unhoused and disabled lives, it is more critical than ever that we divest from law enforcement and invest in non-carceral community focused crisis response and health programs. With the shattering of our social safety net through Federal attacks on Medicaid and the elimination of state health services and programs, low income immigrant communities, Black and Brown communities, trans people, people with disabilities, and older adults are at risk of losing vital benefits, like home and community-based services that keep us alive and enable us to live integrated into our communities. Without access to these services, people will be forced into institutions to access care and segregated from society.

These attacks not only violate well established and hard-won civil rights of people with disabilities provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Olmstead v. Lois Curtis et al., but also the visions of safety and community-based systems of care that our communities have long fought for. We understand that a rights framework is one useful tool to combat discrimination and harm, but established rights are being systemically weakened and chipped away at with each passing year. Rights frameworks were not designed with the most marginalized in mind, and rights are not enough to achieve true justice. Justice requires us to work towards a horizon of abolition by divesting from law enforcement and investing in disability justice centered, community visions of safety. Linda Becerra Moran and Victor Perez should still be with us today, and we urge you to join us in meeting the call of both the present and future moment by working towards a future where Black and Brown, trans, unhoused, immigrant, disabled people can not only survive but thrive.

However, it can be important for you to understand litigation abuse so that you can recognize it. We have general information below that might be helpful. You can also find free and paid lawyers on our Finding a Lawyer page if you want to get specific advice about your situation.

What is litigation abuse?

When a victim ends an abusive relationship, the abuser may try to keep power and control by misusing the court system against the victim. For example, the abuser might:

file repeated petitions or motions without a legal reason to do so;

try to delay the process by asking to postpone one or many court dates (adjournments);

appeal the judge’s orders without a legal reason to do so;

serve you with inappropriate demands; or

take other actions that make you go to court again and again.

This type of behavior could be considered “litigation abuse”, also called “vexatious litigation” or something else along those lines.

Litigation abuse often takes place in divorces or other complicated cases, especially when both sides have to share documents and information before the trial. You can read more about this in our Preparing for Court - By Yourself section, under What if the abuser is using discovery as an abuse tactic?

What can I do if the abuser is filing many petitions or motions against me?

Unfortunately, litigation abuse can be challenging to deal with because people generally have the right to go to court and file cases. However, some states have started passing laws to protect victims from abusive litigation, recognizing that abusers often use the courts to keep contact with the victim or continue a pattern of abuse. In states that have litigation abuse laws, the judge may be more willing to do things like limit the abuser’s ability to file new court cases.

Even if your state does not have a specific abusive litigation law, you can still try to show the judge that the abuser is using the court in bad faith and ask the judge to punish the abuser. For example, you may file a motion asking the judge to make the abuser pay your legal fees each time s/he loses a case or motion against you. Sometimes, a financial penalty can be enough to make the abuser stop. If this is something you’d like to pursue, hopefully, a lawyer can help you figure out the process in your state.",,N,,2025-08-28 16:57:10.641363

Abrego Garcia was released Friday from a jail in Tennessee, where he has been charged with human smuggling.
But in March, the Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison, alleging he was a member of MS-13.
Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally.
There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has come to encapsulate much of President Donald Trump ’s hard-line immigration agenda, wants to seek asylum in the United States, his lawyers told a federal judge Wednesday.

The asylum request — Abrego Garcia’s second, after a denial in 2019 — has been submitted in a Maryland immigration court, further complicating his complex immigration case that intensified in March when he was wrongfully deported to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador.

The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia, 30, is part of the dangerous MS-13 gang — an allegation he denies — and has said it intends to deport him to the African country of Uganda.

If Abrego Garcia’s new asylum request is approved, it could provide a green card and a path to citizenship. But his petition must go through the U.S. immigration court system, which is not part of the judiciary but an arm of the Department of Justice and under the Trump administration’s authority.

Asylum or deportation

Immigration courts have become a key focus of Trump’s renewed immigration enforcement efforts. The president has fired more than 50 immigration judges since he returned to the White House in January.

But Abrego Garcia has something that most people in his situation lack: A team of lawyers fighting for him and a federal judge who is monitoring his case.

His attorneys filed a lawsuit before U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland to ensure that Abrego Garcia can exercise his constitutional right to fight against deportation in immigration court. They have also argued he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has told authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.

Xinis stated explicitly during a conference call with lawyers Wednesday that she will not — and cannot — rule on whether Abrego Garcia is granted asylum or is deported.

“We have the understanding that the asylum process is of no moment to me,” Xinis said. “I don’t have jurisdiction over that.”

But Xinis said she can weigh in to ensure Abrego Garcia is allowed to exercise his right to due process. His attorneys say he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals, before he can be deported.

Xinis said she’ll focus on whether Abrego Garcia goes through required immigration court process or “if there is no process.”

“But there could be shades of that,” she said.

The government cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the continental U.S. before an evidentiary hearing for the lawsuit on Oct. 6, Xinis ruled. She also ordered that he be kept within 200 miles (320 kilometers) of her court in Greenbelt to ensure he can access his lawyers, who said Monday that he’s in a Virginia detention facility.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday from a jail in Tennessee, where he has been charged with human smuggling. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained him in Baltimore on Monday and said he would be deported to Uganda.

During Wednesday’s conference call, Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said the government disagrees with the court’s order not to remove Abrego Garcia while the lawsuit is pending but that it will comply.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers say sending him to Uganda would be punishment for successfully fighting his deportation to El Salvador, refusing to plead guilty to the smuggling charges and for seeking release from jail in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia is facing immigration proceedings with a level of legal representation and oversight that few people get, according to Ohio State University law professor César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández.

“I wish I could tell you that I am 100% confident that they’re not going to stick him on an airplane to Kampala right now,” he said, naming Uganda’s capital. “But I can’t because the president is personally involved in his legal fight. The attorney general is personally involved in his legal fight … Half the Cabinet officials know who he is.”

An earlier request for asylum

Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador at the age of 16, around 2011, because a local gang was extorting and terrorized his family, according to court records. He arrived in the U.S. without authorization and joined his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen, and settled in Maryland.

Abrego Garcia found work in construction, eventually got married and started a family. In 2019, he was detained by local police in Maryland when he arrived outside a Home Depot in search of work as a day laborer.

Authorities had been told by a confidential informant that Abrego Garcia and other men outside the store could be identified as members of MS-13 because of their clothing and tattoos. Abrego Garcia was never charged — and has repeatedly denied the allegation. He was turned over to ICE and subsequently applied for asylum.

A U.S. immigration judge denied his request because he applied more than a year after he had entered the U.S. But the immigration judge issued an order shielding Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he established he had a well-founded fear of gang persecution.

Abrego Garcia was released under federal supervision and continued to live with his American wife and children. He checked in with ICE each year, received a federal work permit and was working as a sheet metal apprentice earlier this year, his lawyers have said.

But in March, the Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison, alleging he was a member of MS-13.

Wrongful deportation and his return

The deportationviolated the immigration judge’s 2019 order barring his removal to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia’s wife sued to bring him back. Facing mounting pressure and a U.S. Supreme Court order, the Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. in June, where he was charged with human smuggling, a federal offense.

Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying it was filed to punish him for challenging his deportation.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee. There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him. While officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling, he was allowed to drive away with only a warning.

A Homeland Security agent testified that he didn’t begin investigating until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The trial is set for January.

Federal officials argue Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and the immigration judge’s 2019 ruling deemed him eligible for expulsion, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/110182397.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-28 17:57:15.215451

What we learned, Thursday 28 August

Another busy final sitting day of the week. We are wrapping up the live blog here. This is what made the news:

Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja met the prime minister to discuss gambling ads and Gaza, with the meeting initially cancelled but eventually rescheduled.

The Pentagon walked back a statement describing defence minister Richard Marles’ meeting with his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, and vice-president JD Vance as a “happenstance encounter”.

Marles and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, faced questions on that in the final question time of the week, as well as Australia’s relationship with the US and Israel.

Albanese said the South Australian algal bloom was directly related to climate change.

Richard Boyle has avoided jail time for blowing the whistle on unethical debt recovery practices at the Australian Taxation Office.

Bob Katter told a journalist “I punch blokes in the mouth for saying that” for mentioning his Lebanese heritage during a press conference where he threw his support behind the anti-immigration, so-called “March for Australia” rallies planned for 31 August.

Qantas’ net profit rose by a third to $1.6bn in the year to June as customer numbers surged and Jetstar revenue surged while fuel costs fell.

We’ll be back tomorrow with a regular live news blog. Take care until then.

ABC welcomes decision not to convict ATO whistleblower

The ABC has welcomed the decision not to convict ATO whistleblower, Richard Boyle and again called for strengthened whistleblower protections.

Boyle gave information to investigative journalist Adele Ferguson in 2018 on tactics used on taxpayers who owed money that resulted in a joint Nine and Four Corners investigation in 2018.

ABC director of news Justin Stevens said:

We acknowledge the seriousness of these offences. However, Boyle had principled intentions, and his actions were in the public’s interest. His allegations were vindicated. He received no personal gain and has paid a high personal price for his whistleblowing.

If it wasn’t for whistleblowers such as Richard Boyle coming forward to journalists, there are many important issues affecting people’s wellbeing and livelihoods that the public would never know about.

Human rights organisations condemn noncitizen deportation bill

The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and the Human Rights Law Centre are among the organisations condemning legislation introduced into parliament this week that removes procedural fairness for noncitizens the government is seeking to move to third countries.

In legislation introduced in the parliament on Tuesday, the home affairs minister said the changes will address the cohort who have remained in Australia following the NZYQ high court decision.

He said:

Procedural fairness is a fundamental principle in many areas of decision-making. However, these provisions can and are being used by noncitizens to delay and frustrate their removal, at cost to the commonwealth in circumstances where it is neither necessary nor appropriate for it to continue to apply.

The amendments in this bill are largely directed at noncitizens who have come to the end of any visa processes, and who are on a removal pathway.

These provisions are primarily directed to noncitizens who have exhausted all legitimate avenues to remain in Australia – and for whom removal is the only remaining outcome under Australian law.

He said the purpose of the law should be clear to give effect to removal as swiftly and effectively as possible.

The human rights organisations say the bill would “strip migrants and refugees of their legal rights” when sending them to third countries such as Nauru, and was “yet another attempt at rushed law-making”.

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said:

The decisions are serious and lifelong. We are talking about people being permanently deported to places like Nauru. Decisions like this must not be made without fundamental legal safeguards. This legislation is clearly designed to manipulate the law so that the government is not accountable to the courts.

Josephine Langbien, associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

This legislation would save the government from having to consider basic questions like whether someone can access the medical care they need in Nauru, or whether they would be permanently separated from their families. By eliminating safeguards that are designed to ensure fairness and accuracy, the government is showing that it does not care if it gets these life-changing decisions wrong.

Family of girl killed in Stonehaven bus crash release statement

The family of Milla Killeen, the 12-year-old girl killed in the bus crash at Stonehaven in Victoria yesterday, have released a statement and a photo to the media.

The family said:

Our whole family are struggling to come to terms with the loss of our beloved Milla.

We were made aware of the crash quite quickly, but it wasn’t for several hours that our worst fears were realised - Milla was the one that was sadly taken.

She was a beautiful soul with the whole world in front of her.

Milla had the patience of a saint.

She was so kind and protective of those she loved, especially her younger brother.

Milla was thriving at school where she loved learning new languages.

It brought us great joy when she would come home and try to teach her nan bits of Indonesian or Japanese that she’d learned throughout the day.

Milla was very artistic, enjoyed drawing and designing lots of different things and she loved her sport.

She used to play junior footy but lately had been focusing on basketball where she reached representative level and was about to play in a final on Friday night.

Milla was a passionate supporter of the Geelong Football Club, and we will always remember her sitting in the stands with her mum and pa, cheering for the Cats.

We don’t know why this has happened.

It’s difficult to describe all the emotions we feel right now but we are supporting one another and now ask that our family’s privacy is respected.

The report has been with the federal government since the start of the month, but there haven’t been any indications on when it’ll be released.

There is a sign it may be imminent, however, with the head of the trial, Tony Allen, posting on LinkedIn that there will be a series of briefings on the outcome of the trial in Australia and New Zealand towards the end of September.

The office of the communications minister, Anika Wells, was approached for comment.

The trial has kept quiet about its findings, mostly, since the report was finalised, amid concerns about leaks to media.

Taylor defends focus on Marles meeting

Marles’s US meeting was ‘productive’, assistant minister says

Matt Thistlethwaite, the assistant minister for foreign affairs, has said the meeting between the defence minister, Richard Marles, and his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, was “productive” and dismissed attention on whether it was a “happenstance” or a meeting from the Coalition.

Thistlethwaite told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing Marles told him the meeting was productive, and the government believes the alliance is going well and strong.

Asked why the Pentagon initially described it as happenstance, the assistant minister said that was a question for the Pentagon.

I don’t know about that statement put out, [but] we can confirm the meeting occurred and Richard also met with Marco Rubio and the vice president JD Vance. Critical minerals, treaty relationship, issues internationally were discussed.

He said a meeting had been requested with US president Donald Trump and that “is all we can do”.

He questioned the “priorities” of the opposition in raising it during question time, rather than a specific question on Aukus, when the government has been focused on the cost of living for Australians in parliament this week.

Federal government condemns planned anti-immigration rallies

The Albanese government has condemned anti-immigration rallies scheduled for this weekend, saying the “brand of fight-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism” has no place in modern Australia.

A series of so-called March for Australia rallies are planned in cities across the country on Sunday to protest against “mass migration”.

In a statement on Thursday, the minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, said there was “no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion”.

We stand with modern Australia against these rallies – nothing could be less Australian.

The multicultural affairs minister, Anne Aly, said “multiculturalism was an integral and valued part of our identity”.

We stand with all Australians, no matter where they were born, against those who seek to divide us and who seek to intimidate migrant communities. We will not be intimidated.

This brand of far-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism has no place in modern Australia.

The shadow multicultural affairs minister, Paul Scarr, earlier this week condemned a pamphlet promoting the rallies that referenced Indian migrants.

Scarr said at the time:

So I am compelled to rise in this place at the earliest opportunity to call it out and to condemn it and say that the language and references to Australians of Indian heritage is unacceptable. It is outrageous ... it seeks to divide Australians at a time when we need to unite.

Whether or not he thinks Folbigg innocent is ‘irrelevant’ to payout calculation, NSW AG says

The innocence of Kathleen Folbigg, jailed for two decades after the deaths of her four children, was “irrelevant” to the calculation of a $2m payout, the NSW attorney general says.

Folbigg was jailed in 2003 before being released and having her convictions quashed in 2023, when fresh scientific evidence cast reasonable doubt over her guilt.

Michael Daley did not meet with her before announcing the payment offer on 7 August, telling a budget estimates hearing on Thursday that “it would not have assisted” him in determining the amount offered.

The best way to deal with ex gratia payments is to deal with the objective facts. When you meet with people seeking ex gratia payments, it raises expectations.

Daley said he did not plan to meet with her now that “the matter has concluded”.

I can’t see any point in doing that. I don’t want to hold any hope out to her that she can come in and ask for that figure to be varied because I think the premier has indicated quite clearly, on a number of occasions, that it won’t be.

Labor has been under pressure to explain how it arrived at the $2m figure, after experts suggested it should be five to 10 times higher.

Lindy Chamberlain, jailed for four years before authorities agreed a dingo had likely taken her baby from an Uluru campsite, was awarded $1.7m, including legal costs, in 1992. That sum would be worth $4 million today.

But Folbigg’s case stood alone, Daley suggested.

Medical evidence, which led to her release and acquittal in 2023, did not exist at the time of her trial.

“That was a huge factor,” the attorney general said.

“What set this matter apart was there was no proven malfeasance on the part of the state.”

He said he followed a process to determine the amount offered.

Whether he considered Folbigg innocent or guilty was “completely irrelevant” to his decision.

The uptick comes as the Trump administration ramps up its mass deportation campaign.

The agency contracts with a airline broker called CSI Aviation, which then charters flights with airline carriers. The Trump administration has vastly increased that capacity by adding military planes and commercial airlines like the budget carrier Avelo Airlines — which began conducting deportation flights out of the Mesa airport this spring.

Tom Cartwright is retired financial executive turned immigration rights activist who's been tracking ICE flights for the last six years. He says starting things started picking up in May.

“So up until about mid-May, typically I would see somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to 12 planes each day flying for ICE Air. And then, around mid-day, that really moved up to more like 13 to 15,” he said.

His July report shows more than 1,200 ICE flights in total — both deportation flights and domestic shuttles from state-to-state. It’s the highest monthly total he’s ever recorded.

“The only other time flights were anywhere near the level they are now was back in 2021, with the mass deportation of Haitians,” Cartwright said.

Cartwright has tracked 329 domestic ICE flights that took off from Phoenix so far this year, one of the highest of any U.S. city.

He says August is expected to be another high month for ICE flights.

“Showing up and explaining your own record on human rights is the bare minimum for any government that purports to exercise international leadership and uphold democratic norms,” said Uzra Zeya, president and CEO of Human Rights First.
Zeya previously served as under secretary of state for civilian security, democracy, and human rights in the Biden administration.
“The United States isn’t being singled out — every UN member state takes its turn having its human rights record assessed.
Instead it should mean that other human rights experts and bodies intensify their focus and reporting on that State,” Lynch posted on the social platform X.

Human Rights Council (HRC), which President Trump withdrew the U.S. from in February.

A State Department official said taking part would ignore the body’s “persistent failure to condemn the most egregious human rights violators” and that the U.S. would not be “lectured about our human rights record by the likes of HRC members such as Venezuela, China, or Sudan.”

The review, according to the U.N., is aimed at promoting introspection of human rights record and encouraging accountability on the global stage.

Known as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), it calls on member states to submit a report every 4 1/2 years on actions it has taken to improve the human rights situation in their own countries, and receive recommendations from member states for continued improvement. The U.S. was expected to submit its report in November.

Reuters first reported that the U.S. would not participate.

Spokespeople for the intergovernmental HRC and the U.N. human rights office told Reuters the U.S. Mission in Geneva had notified them of the decision.

The move was slammed by human rights advocates. The U.S.-based Human Rights First called the Trump administration’s refusal to participate “another damaging setback to American credibility on human rights and accountability.”

Human Rights First said the U.S. joins Israel as the only country to not submit a report since the UPR started in 2006, but it noted Israel rejoined the process in 2013, 2018 and 2023.

“Showing up and explaining your own record on human rights is the bare minimum for any government that purports to exercise international leadership and uphold democratic norms,” said Uzra Zeya, president and CEO of Human Rights First.

“The United States isn’t being singled out — every UN member state takes its turn having its human rights record assessed. Running away from that scrutiny doesn’t just show weakness and a lack of confidence, it will give rights-abusing governments cover to do the same themselves,” she continued.

Phil Lynch, executive director of international service for Human Rights First, criticized Trump as turning the U.S. into “a human rights pariah state.”

“To avoid a domino effect, it is important that a government’s refusal to participate in the UPR does not mean they escape scrutiny. Instead it should mean that other human rights experts and bodies intensify their focus and reporting on that State,” Lynch posted on the social platform X.

Michael Posner, director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at NYU Stern School of Business, told Reuters that the U.S. was undermining global efforts on human rights.

Strategic Move Positions YD Bio Limited for Accelerated Innovation and Market Expansion

Trading of common stock and warrants of the new public company, YD Bio Limited, is expected to commence on the Nasdaq Global Market on August 29, 2025, under the ticker symbols “YDES” and “YDESW”

TAIWAN, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YD Bio Limited (“YD Bio Ltd” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: YDES), a biotechnology company advancing DNA methylation-based cancer detection technology and ophthalmologic innovations, today announced the successful completion of its previously announced business combination with Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp. (“Breeze”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. Beginning August 29, 2025, YD Bio’s ordinary shares and warrants will trade on Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbols “YDES” and “YDESW,” respectively. The transaction was approved by Breeze shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held on August 14, 2025.

The Company also announced that the previously announced PIPE offering closed, in full, contemporaneously with the closing of the business combination. The proceeds of the PIPE offering together with the cash released to the Company from the trust for the benefit of the former Breeze shareholders, after satisfaction of all business combination closing-related expenses, is expected to yield more than $11,500,000 to fund the Company’s future operations.

The Business Combination and the PIPE closing mark a significant step in the Company’s evolution, positioning YD Bio Ltd as an emerging leader in the biotech industry with strong growth potential across multiple fast-growing healthcare markets. By entering the public markets, YD Bio Ltd is poised to accelerate innovation, scale production, and drive the development and commercialization of groundbreaking technologies.

YD Bio Ltd’s business model centers on partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies to transform innovative technologies into commercially viable drugs and cancer detection diagnostics. Led by Chairman Dr. Ethan Shen, a biomedical expert with over 30 years of experience, the Company is focused on advancing a diversified portfolio of innovative healthcare solutions across oncology diagnostics, regenerative medicine, and clinical trial support. The Company’s core programs include:

Blood-Based Cancer Detection: Through exclusive licensing agreements with its partner EG BioMed, the Company is developing proprietary DNA methylation-based detection technology for a range of cancers. This includes a screening test for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, which is available as a laboratory-developed test (LDT) through EG BioMed’s CLIA-certified laboratory, and a monitoring test for recurrent breast cancer, expected to launch as an LDT later this year.

Stem Cell- and Exosome-Based Ophthalmology Therapies : In partnership with 3D Global Biotech, the Company is advancing corneal stem cell and exosome technologies for the treatment of ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, and corneal injury. Clinical development efforts are underway, with Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved specimen collection and plans to initiate trials evaluating exosome-based contact lenses and artificial tears in 2027.

Clinical Trial and Ancillary Services : The Company has served as a trusted supplier of investigational drugs and ancillary materials to global pharmaceutical companies, supporting clinical development and post-launch commercialization.

The Company’s multi-decade exclusive licensing agreements, together with its proprietary patented technologies, provide the Company with a significant first-mover advantage across its clinical markets.

“Today is an incredibly proud moment and a major milestone for our company, our employees and our shareholders, as we begin our journey as a publicly traded company,” said Dr. Ethan Shen, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of YD Bio Ltd. “Since our founding in 2013, YD Bio has evolved from a supplier of clinical trial drugs and health supplements into a dynamic innovator in diagnostics and therapeutics. From pioneering exosome technologies to advancing early cancer detection, our progress reflects years of dedication and transformation. Becoming a publicly traded Nasdaq-listed company enables us to accelerate our mission of delivering innovative solutions that improve lives and advance global health. We are profoundly grateful to the patients who participate in our trials, our dedicated team members, and our investors. We believe this achievement represents the next step in advancing our programs and products, redefining the future of healthcare, and bringing life-changing solutions to patients who need them.”

Cal Poly Pomona postponed its annual fall job fair this week after students, alumni and community members criticized its inclusion of Customs and Border Protection as an in-person recruiter, underscoring the heightened sensitivity about immigration agencies on college campuses this fall.

The interim president of the Los Angeles County campus with nearly 28,000 students — the majority of whom are Latino — said leadership responded to the criticism and decided to rethink their approach to job fairs.

“We have listened carefully and are leveraging this input to design career programming this fall that is more personal and better tailored to the evolving needs of our students and to workforce demands,” said Iris S. Levine in a public letter Monday. “I want to thank those of you who reached out and shared your perspectives with honesty and passion,” she added.

Tracee Passeggi, the career center director at Cal Poly Pomona, said she received 200 to 250 emails between late Thursday and Monday protesting the presence of immigration law enforcement at the job fair.

In the days leading up to the postponement, social media swirled with rumors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be among the employers at the September job fair, something the campus said is not true in a Tuesday FAQ.

“FYI @calpolypomona invited ICE to come and recruit at a job fair on September 18th from 10:30am-2:30pm. Even when calling themselves a HSI (Hispanic serving institution). Stand up against the racial profiling and ICE bounty hunters. Contact: Career@cpp.edu, President@cpp.edu, Admin_affairs@cpp.edu,” read one message from a poster on the campus’s main Facebook page on Sunday.

More than 106,000 employers share job updates on the Cal Poly Pomona career portal called Handshake, a common software tool among college campuses. Both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are in the system and receive updates about campus career events. But ICE has never taken part in a career fair, the FAQ said.

Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protection, the multi-pronged agency that oversees Border Patrol, a law enforcement agency that’s conducted immigration raids in California, was among the roughly 200 employers registered for the career fair slated Sept. 18-19 and has participated in almost every job fair at the campus since 2017.

Billy Gallagher, the faculty union senior field representative at Cal Poly Pomona, said the hyper-vigilance about immigration law enforcement on the campus makes sense, especially given that judges have faulted the agencies for using racial criteria in their arrests in the Los Angeles area. The federal government under the current Trump administration has appealed a preliminary injunction from a district judge to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“There’ve been arrests, U.S. citizens swept up. At this point, it’s hard to tell even who’s who in some of these raids, so there was definitely concern among faculty for sure,” Gallagher said, adding that officers at both Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have led immigration raids in California. Most of the students on campus are Latino, he also noted.

Career fair postponed, not cancelled

The campus doesn’t have a new date for the career fair, said Passeggi of the career center, but she aims to finalize those plans by late September, she said in an interview.

The postponed career fair was technically two events on consecutive days, and Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to appear on just one of those days with some 80 other employers.

Still, both dates were postponed. Passeggi said her team will use the opportunity to organize the fairs in new ways. What that means, she doesn’t know yet, but she pointed to the job fairs for the school’s hospitality and education majors that are smaller and subject-specific. Each event includes 200 students and 35 employers. The postponed event usually draws more than 1,500 students. It’s also outside and exposed to the elements on hot or, in the spring, possibly rainy days. She’s unsure if the redesigned fairs will be virtual or in-person.

“We have received some feedback from students saying that they were disappointed that the career fair was canceled,” she said, noting that her office was battling two types of misinformation: that the fair was called off and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was among the employers. Neither is true.

The Career Center will still support students seeking to connect with employers and organize internships, she said.

With much of the email and social media blowback occurring over the weekend, she thinks the campus leadership rallied fast. “We moved as quickly as we could” in a transparent manner, she said, pointing to the FAQ and letter from the president.

Nonetheless, “I can definitely hear where our community is coming from,” she said.

Faculty, student perspectives

The campus’ response to the outcry was sensible, said Mario Guerrero, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona who is chair of the university’s Political Science Department. “I think it speaks volumes about (Levine’s) leadership and being able to hear what folks were saying, but also respond appropriately. It’s a super delicate situation for fairly obvious reasons,” he said. “Even reading the comments now, people are still unhappy, and that’s always going to be part of it, but at least you know you can point to leadership being able to make proactive moves to protect the students however they can.”

Guerrero also thinks that the worry over immigration law enforcement as an employer at a job fair tapped into wider fears about those federal agents entering campus and arresting students, faculty or staff.

On Instagram, a student group that’s a subsidiary of the faculty union and that has chapters across multiple Cal State campuses, criticized Cal Poly Pomona for writing that it cannot bar employers from participating in its job fair because it is a public university. “Disappointed once again in administration, ignoring the safety and needs of their campus population — while claiming their hands are tied,” read the text on an Instagram Story posted earlier this week.

The campus administration was “getting pretty pummeled by students,” Gallagher said, and he’s “certainly hoping that the (Cal Poly Pomona) administration continues to listen to students.”

Campus staff limited if federal immigration officers enter campus

The California Faculty Association, the systemwide faculty union, published in January a list of demands to California State University leadership that seeks to block federal agents from conducting immigration law enforcement on campus. The demands, updated in July, included blocking those agencies from participating in job fairs.

But as a public system, Cal State University campuses cannot limit who enters their sites. Cal Poly Pomona administrators said as much in a February email to staff: “CSU is a public university, and a large portion of CSU property is open to the general public. The areas on campus that are open to the general public, like the campus quad and walkways, are also open to federal immigration enforcement officers.”

The notice said that immigration officers cannot enter areas that aren’t open to the general public, such as classrooms that are in session and residence halls — “unless the officer presents a valid judicial warrant or declares that exigent circumstances exist.”

However, the guidance says that staff and faculty do not need to divulge any information. The campus appointed an administrator to deal with immigration law enforcement. The guidance says personnel should “respectfully inform the officer that you lack authority but will immediately contact” the designated administrator. If that person isn’t available, personnel should contact campus police or campus legal counsel.

The University of California has similar guidance and stresses that hiding evidence or individuals violates federal law. So does interfering with an arrest. “Further, you should not put yourself in physical danger,” UC’s guidance says.

Cal State University spokesperson Amy Bentley-Smith didn’t answer CalMatters’ questions about whether other campuses invited immigration law enforcement agencies to job fairs. But in an email, she wrote that campuses should try to “mitigate” community concerns about those agencies appearing on site. “That can include informing key stakeholders, like Dream Center coordinators, of the dates and times when” immigration law enforcement are on campus, she wrote.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president’s pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it’s unclear whether he might have partners.

Army declines to release contract

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

Company will be responsible for security

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it’s classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump’s administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics’ past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group CEO George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn’t name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn’t partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.

A Rwandan government spokesperson said Thursday that seven deportees arrived in the East African country earlier this month. No announcement was made at the time.

Rwanda did say in early August that it had agreed to take up to 250 deportees but declined then to say when the first would arrive.

Two other African nations, South Sudan and Eswatini, have already accepted a small number of deportees from the U.S. in what have also been secretive deals, while Uganda said last week it has an agreement in principle to take deportees.

Here’s what we know about the deportations of migrants from the U.S.

Rwanda

Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo said the seven deportees are being visited by representatives from the United Nations’ migration agency and Rwandan social services.

Three of them want to return to their home countries while the other four “wish to stay and build lives in Rwanda,” she said. The Rwandan government didn’t say where the deportees are being held.

There was no information on their identities, nationalities or if they have criminal records.

Deportees previously sent to South Sudan and Eswatini were all described by U.S. authorities as dangerous criminals.

Rwanda’s deal with the U.S. follows a contentious migrant agreement it reached with the U.K. in 2022 that collapsed and was ruled unlawful by Britain’s Supreme Court. That deal was meant to see people seeking asylum in the U.K. sent to Rwanda, where they would stay if their asylum applications were approved.

Uganda

Uganda, which borders Rwanda, said it would accept deportees from the U.S. as long as they don’t have criminal records or are unaccompanied minors.

The U.S. has said it wants to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has become a flashpoint in U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, to Uganda.

Like the other countries, Uganda didn’t give any other details of its deal with the U.S. or what it might gain from accepting deported migrants. African nations might get a range of benefits for accepting deportees and improving their relations with the Trump administration.

“We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency, in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,” Ugandan human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio said when his country announced it was seeking a deal with the U.S.

South Sudan

The U.S. sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in July after their deportations were held up by a legal challenge. That led to them being kept for weeks in a converted shipping container at an American military base in nearby Djibouti.

U.S. officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S.

South Sudan’s government said it would ensure their “safety and wellbeing” but has declined to say where the men are being held and what their fate might be.

South Sudan has been wracked by conflict since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011 and is teetering on the edge of civil war again.

Eswatini

Two weeks after the South Sudan deportations, the U.S. announced that it had sent five other men — citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos — to the small kingdom of Eswatini, in southern Africa.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described them as violent criminals whose home countries had refused to take them back.

Eswatini’s government said the men would be held in solitary confinement until their repatriation, and later said that might take up to a year.

A human rights lawyer in Eswatini has taken the authorities to court alleging the men are being denied legal representation while being held in a maximum-security prison.

The current limitation on classrooms, instructors, firearms ranges and other assets could limit FLETC's throughout, they said.
For its part, FLETC stressed that it is committed to helping its own employees work through the changes.","The Trump administration is pausing training at the federal government's primary law enforcement academies for anyone not related to immigration enforcement, saying the change is necessary to meet the president’s “immediate priorities.”

The administration is in the midst of surging 10,000 employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after securing funding for the hires in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, creating unprecedented demand at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. Training needs could create bottlenecks as ICE seeks to rapidly onboard the new officers and agents, current and former officials have warned, and the administration is now taking drastic measures to avoid those pitfalls.

“To support the onboarding of 10,000 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations personnel and 1,000 ICE Homeland Security Investigations personnel by Dec. 31st, 2025, we must focus our resources on surge-related training,” acting FLETC Director Paul Baker and his deputy, Ariana Roddini, said in a message to staff Wednesday. “As a result, training programs for agencies not directly involved in these efforts, originally scheduled between Sept. 9 and Dec. 31, 2025 will be rescheduled to later dates in Fiscal Year 2026.”

More than 75 federal law enforcement agencies train at FLETC, which maintains its primary campus in Glynco, Georgia. Those agencies range from other Homeland Security Department components like Border Patrol and the Transportation Security Administration to the National Park Service, military police and inspectors general offices across government.

“We recognize the impact this decision may have on our partner agencies and the additional demands it places on our staff,” Baker and Roddini said.

The DHS component has stood up a Surge Training Operations Center to help manage the influx from ICE and “coordinate planning and execution.” That group is assembling daily to address challenges that arise and meet the administration’s priorities, while still supporting its partner agencies “as much as possible.”

Baker and Roddini added they are examining whether other FLETC sites could accommodate critical training programs and are working with other agencies to find temporary solutions to meet their training needs. In addition to ICE’s 10,000 ERO hires, 1,000 HSI hires and normal federal law enforcement onboarding—which Trump has exempted from his governmentwide hiring freeze—the president’s signature immigration enforcement and tax bill funded 8,500 new employees for Customs and Border Protection and provided $3 billion for Bureau of Prisons hiring.

FLETC itself received $750 million to support those hiring efforts and current and former officials highlighted the need to quickly expand capacity at the training center to accommodate the surges. The current limitation on classrooms, instructors, firearms ranges and other assets could limit FLETC's throughout, they said.

Jason Owens, a longtime Border Patrol official who served as chief of the agency under President Biden and as its chief operating officer through March, recently told Government Executive that expanding capacity at FLETC could create its own speed bumps because construction “doesn’t happen overnight,” requires a buildup of procurement capacity and the typically-not-timely awarding of contracts.

One FLETC employee said the agency did not “appear to be prioritizing the building of long term capabilities.” Instead, the employee said, “they look focused on short term, temporary fixes to accommodate the mission.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For its part, FLETC stressed that it is committed to helping its own employees work through the changes.

(AP) — An immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz ” must keep moving toward shutting down operations by late October, a judge has ruled, even as the state and federal governments fight that decision.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams late Wednesday denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations at the facility, which has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to South Florida Rabbi Mario Rojzman about chaplaincy services at the facility, implying there would soon be no need.

The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a little-used training airport, where chain-link cages now surround large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that Williams’ order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws.

But the judge in Wednesday night's order noted that the detainee population already was dwindling at the facility, and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.”

Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ’ administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison in north Florida.

Williams said in last week’s order that she expected the population of “Alligator Alcatraz” to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can’t bring any new detainees onto the property.

State officials said shutting down the facility for the time being would cost them $15 million to $20 million and that it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if they ultimately are allowed to reopen the facility. They also said that the Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the training airport suitable for a detention center.

“Alligator Alcatraz” has been targeted by several lawsuits, ranging from its impact on the Everglades to civil rights concerns.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit and moved the suit to another court district for procedural reasons.

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.” The suit alleges detainees were being held for weeks without any charges, had disappeared from ICE’s online detainee locator, and no one at the facility was making initial custody or bond determinations.

The groups want a federal court in Fort Myers to issue a restraining order and a temporary injunction that would bar Florida agencies and their contractors from holding detainees there.

Since immigration is a federal issue, the rights groups say Florida agencies and the state's private contractors have no authority to operate the facility. The rights groups want their lawsuit to be certified as a class action.

Meanwhile, almost two dozen Republican-led states urged the appellate court reviewing Williams’ order to overturn it. The 22 states argued in a court filing that she overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

The president has ordered the Commerce Department to begin preparing a new mid-decade census that would count only those who are legally present in the United States.
Census data also drives the allocation of hundreds of billions in federal funds to state and local governments.
To be clear, there has never been a mid-decade census used for congressional apportionment.
What President Trump proposes is not unconstitutional — it’s unprecedented.","President Trump is calling for a recount — a recount of the American people. And he’s calling for something else: a rejection of the Left’s new math and a return to common sense. The president has ordered the Commerce Department to begin preparing a new mid-decade census that would count only those who are legally present in the United States.

Why does that matter?

The Constitution requires that Congress establish the manner by which a census is conducted every 10 years. The results of the census determine how the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are apportioned among the 50 states. Census data also drives the allocation of hundreds of billions in federal funds to state and local governments. So it’s no surprise to hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth from Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is now threatening to dismantle California’s so-called independent redistricting commission and push through a Democrat-favoring election map.

President Trump’s proposal — to count only those legally residing in the country — would force sanctuary cities and states to forfeit the political and financial benefits they’ve gained through open-border policies. The estimated 10 to 11 million illegal immigrants who have entered the U.S. during President Biden’s term were not accidental. While illegal voting has occurred in isolated cases, the real impact is demographic: population growth in deep-blue states that translates into increased congressional representation and control over federal funding.

The 2020 Census, which preceded the current border crisis, already shifted the balance slightly: seven traditionally blue states each lost a congressional seat, giving Republicans a narrow advantage. But left unchanged, the next census could dramatically shift power back to blue states — thanks to the millions of undocumented immigrants now residing within their borders.

To be clear, there has never been a mid-decade census used for congressional apportionment. But there have been mid-decade counts for data collection and planning purposes. What President Trump proposes is not unconstitutional — it’s unprecedented. Congress should support this effort as a benchmark and standard for the 2030 Census, which could occur under a Democratic administration determined to inflate blue-state population numbers through illegal immigration, thereby regaining control of Congress and the federal purse.

Texas offers a case study. With 38 House seats and a red-leaning electorate, it has been a top destination for refugee resettlement under both the Obama and Biden administrations — second only to California. These refugees, lawfully admitted, were disproportionately settled in Houston, Dallas, and Austin — urban centers that have become Democratic strongholds.

The pattern is clear: Democrats have used both legal and illegal immigration to reshape the political landscape and redirect federal resources. Many of President Trump’s early executive orders can be reversed by his successor. But this initiative — teaching the nation to count fairly and accurately — could set a lasting precedent.

And that’s what makes this moment so critical.",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25H150_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 13:56:49.768167

At a time when political rhetoric often generates division and fear, especially over immigration, ""the Church stands as a beacon of God-given hope,"" they said.
Some Catholics are asking, ""What does the pastoral reflection want us to do?""
""The bishops of this country have been engaging in the legislative process for many years for important immigration reform,"" Walsh told The Catholic Messenger.","A pastoral reflection on immigration from the Iowa Catholic bishops aims to present church teaching in a way that ""transcends"" political rhetoric and ""fear and false narratives"" about the issue often found in secular and social media, Bishop Dennis Walsh of Davenport said.

""Our response to those seeking refuge and stability in hope is not only a reflection of our nation's founding values, but is primarily a testament to our fidelity to Christ,"" said Archbishop Thomas Zinkula of Dubuque; Bishop William Joensen of Des Moines; Bishop John Keehner of Sioux City; and Bishop Walsh.

The reflection, titled ""Pilgrims of Hope: A Pastoral Reflection on Immigration,"" was released Aug. 22 by the Iowa Catholic Conference, the public policy arms of the bishops.

""The Catholic Church has always proclaimed the inviolable dignity of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God,"" they said. ""Governments do not bestow this dignity, nor does legal status instill it, but it is intrinsic to every human person as a beloved child of the heavenly Father.""

The Catholic Church has always affirmed the ""right to migrate,"" the bishops wrote, citing St. John XXIII's 1963 encyclical, Pacem in Terris (""Peace on Earth"") The pope, they said, ""taught that 'every human being has the right to freedom of movement and of residence within the confines of his own state. When there are just reasons in favor of it, he must be permitted to migrate to other countries and take up residence there.'""

The nation has a right to regulate its borders, the bishops said, but ""the security of a nation can never be used as an excuse to violate the dignity and human rights of migrants, including the right to due process by law.""

At a time when political rhetoric often generates division and fear, especially over immigration, ""the Church stands as a beacon of God-given hope,"" they said.

""Immigration is not merely a political or economic issue; it is a deeply moral matter that calls for a response rooted in faith, justice, and mercy. Sacred Scripture consistently reveals God’s care for the immigrant and the refugee,"" the bishops said.

""'Pilgrims of Hope' is intended to serve as a guide for the faithful, providing clear and authentic Catholic perspective on the complex issue of migration,"" Walsh told The Catholic Messenger, Davenport's diocesan news outlet. ""The letter seeks to present the church's teaching in a way that transcends the political rhetoric often found in secular and social media, which can focus on fear and false narratives.""

A ""Catholic perspective on immigration must always begin with the inherent dignity of each person. The letter affirms that the rights possessed by every individual are intrinsic to the human person and cannot be disregarded for political expediency,"" Walsh said. ""The pastoral letter is not just another voice in the debate; for Catholics, the magisterial teaching of the church holds a privileged position as it presents the authentic and perennial teaching of the church.""

""Every Catholic Christian has a moral responsibility to ensure that the personal dignity of migrants is upheld,"" the pastoral said. ""This responsibility includes personal dispositions rooted in the truth of the Gospel with its call to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.""

Some Catholics are asking, ""What does the pastoral reflection want us to do?""

It ""seeks to engage Catholics on a deeper level, beyond sound bites and political rhetoric,"" Walsh said. ""The teaching of the church is not opinion"" but is ""authoritative,"" he said, and this teaching — not the ""political platforms of both parties"" — should be used to help Catholics ""appropriately form their consciences.""

""The church does not advocate for open borders,"" he continued. ""A government has a duty to ensure that its citizens are protected. When people commit serious and sometimes violent crime, the government should and must act in those situations for the protection of society. However, the vast majority of those who have been here peacefully have adjusted well to life in the United States. Perhaps a pathway should be found for them to legalize their status.""

""Meaningful change comes not through 'quick fixes' but through long-term dedication to advocacy, hospitality, and accompaniment,"" the pastoral stated. ""The call to welcome the stranger challenges us to move beyond comfort and convenience, embracing a spirit of encounter that reflects the heart of the Gospel.""

""The bishops of this country have been engaging in the legislative process for many years for important immigration reform,"" Walsh told The Catholic Messenger. ""However, there does not really seem to be the political will or desire to fix the problem. It seems that politicians prefer to keep the problem for their political purposes rather than find real solutions.""

""First and foremost,"" the pastoral reflection stated, ""prayer must guide our personal and collective responses, asking God for the prudence to enact just policies and the grace to see Jesus in the faces of those seeking a better life.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/20250827T1656-IOWA-PASTORAL-IMMIGRATION-1803114%20%281%29.jpg?h=2832428a&itok=2V3jbrPH,N,,2025-08-28 13:57:01.704065

At least not according to a decision this week that rejected a motion to dismiss from Hannah Dugan, the Wisconsin state judge who’s charged with concealing from arrest and obstructing the apprehension of a person wanted by immigration authorities for removal.

Unless Dugan’s lawyers appeal and get the ruling reversed, it brings her a step closer to trial in one of the criminal cases the administration has touted in Trump’s second term. The decision comes as the administration is having a tough time getting cases off the ground in Washington, D.C., where federal prosecutors in Jeanine Pirro’s office have been unable to even secure indictments in cases alleging assaults on agents amid the federal takeover of the nation’s capital.

Unless Dugan’s lawyers appeal and get the ruling reversed, it brings her a step closer to trial.

In Dugan’s failed motion to dismiss, her lawyers cited the Trump immunity case while arguing that she “has both immunity from conviction and immunity from prosecution.” But U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman ruled that the separation of powers concerns that animated Trump v. United States, which focused on protecting the president, “do not arise when one of the nation’s many judges is subject to prosecution.”

While acknowledging that Dugan raised “very real concerns,” the Clinton appointee wrote that the judicial defendant doesn’t get immunity “simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job.’”

The federal judge set a scheduling hearing for Wednesday that could shed light on the next steps in the state judge’s case.

Dugan, who has pleaded not guilty, was arrested in April in what The New York Times called “a major escalation in the Trump administration’s battle with local authorities over deportations.” That battle and the Republican administration’s broader effort to use the law to exert power over Democratic-aligned cities, groups and people is still raging today.

In response to the ruling rejecting Dugan’s immunity claim, her lawyers said they were disappointed and that they “look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

If the case goes to trial, then that would be another difference between it and the prosecution that prompted the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. The high court’s decision came in July 2024, and the justices instructed the trial judge to apply the new ruling to Trump’s case.

Not all are deportation flights.","Immigration advocates gather like clockwork outside Seattle's King County International Airport to witness deportation flights and spread word of where they are going and how many people are aboard. Until recently, they could keep track of the flights using publicly accessible websites.

But the monitors and others say airlines are now using dummy call signs for deportation flights and are blocking the planes' tail numbers from tracking websites, even as the number of deportation flights hits record highs under President Donald Trump. The changes forced them to find other ways to follow the flights, including by sharing information with other groups and using data from an open-source exchange that tracks aircraft transmissions.

Their work helps people locate loved ones who are deported in the absence of information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which rarely discloses flights. News organizations have used such flight tracking in reporting.

Tom Cartwright, a retired J.P. Morgan financial officer turned immigration advocate, tracked 1,214 deportation-related flights in July — the highest level since he started watching in January 2020. About 80% are operated by three airlines: GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo Airlines. They carry immigrants to other airports to be transferred to overseas flights or take them across the border, mostly to Central American countries and Mexico.

Cartwright tracked 5,962 flights from the start of Trump's second term through July, a 41% increase of 1,721 over the same period in 2024. Those figures including information from major deportation airports but not smaller ones like King County International Airport, also known as Boeing Field. Cartwright's figures include 68 military deportation flights since January — 18 in July alone. Most have gone to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

The work became so demanding that Cartwright, 71, and his group, Witness at the Border, turned over the job this month to Human Rights First, which dubbed its project ""ICE Flight Monitor.""

“His work brings essential transparency to U.S. government actions impacting thousands of lives and stands as a powerful example of citizen-driven accountability in defense of human rights and democracy,"" Uzrz Zeya, Human Rights First's chief executive officer, said.

The airlines did not respond to multiple email requests for comment. ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which would not confirm any security measures it has taken.

La Resistencia, a Seattle-area nonprofit immigration rights group, has monitored 59 flights at Boeing Field and five at the Yakima airport in 2025, surpassing its 2024 total of 42.

Not all are deportation flights. Many are headed to or from immigration detention centers or to airports near the border. La Resistencia counted 1,023 immigrants brought in to go to the ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington, and 2,279 flown out, often to states on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“ICE is doing everything in its power to make it as hard as possible to differentiate their contractors’ government activities from other commercial endeavors,” organizer Guadalupe Gonzalez told The Associated Press.

Airlines can legally block data

The Federal Aviation Administration allows carriers to block data like tail numbers from public flight tracking websites under the Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed program, or LADD, said Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for FlightRadar24.

“Tail numbers are like VIN numbers on cars,” Gonzalez said.

Planes with blocked tail numbers no longer appear on websites like FlightRadar24 or FlightAware. The tracker page identifies these them as “N/A - Not Available"" as they move across the map and when they are on the tarmac. Destinations and arrival times aren't listed.

Carriers have occasionally used LADD for things like presidential campaigns, but in March, FlightRadar24 received LADD notices for more than a dozen aircraft, Petchenik said. It was unusual to see that many aircraft across multiple airlines added to the blocking list, he said. The blocked planes were often used for ICE deportations and transfers, he said.

Of the 94 ICE Air contractor planes that La Resistencia was tracking nationwide, 40 have been unlisted, Gonzalez said.

Similar things happened with the call signs airlines use to identify flights in the air, Gonzalez said.

Airlines use a combination of letters in their company name and numbers to identify their planes. GlobalX uses GXA, for example. But in the past few months, the ICE carriers have changed their regular call signs, making it more difficult to locate their immigration activates, he said.

Cameras at Boeing Field help volunteers track flights

King County International Airport is one of the few sites in the country where passengers can be seen getting off and on the planes, thanks to county-operated cameras. Volunteers gather each time a flight arrives to count each person and note whether they struggle on the stairs or appear to have health issues.

ICE Air operations at Boeing Field started in 2011. The county set up cameras on the tarmac in 2023 after King County Executive Dow Constantine, having unsuccessfully tried to stop the ICE flights, issued an order requiring the county to track them at the airport. The county publishes monthly statistics on them.

The cameras record immigrants arriving on buses, being searched and being led up the stairs onto the planes. On Tuesday, one man who was hunched over shuffled down the bus' stairs and across the tarmac using a cane, then an officer helped him climb onto the plane, one step at a time.

Detainees must navigate the plane’s stairway with their ankles chained together. Their wrists are also chained, and those cuffs are connected to a chain around their waist, so they can’t raise their arms, hold the railing or take big steps, activist Stan Shikuma told the AP.

The video can be viewed live on a giant screen in a nearby building where advocates can watch people being taken off buses from the ICE Northwest detention center. It's also livestreamed on the county website.

“They’re patted down, head to toe, mouth examined, sometimes the chains are tightened before they’re allowed to board the plane,"" Shikuma said. ""People coming off the plane: same treatment.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/08/AP25238752100359-e1756318777309.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-28 13:57:06.656195

Taliban leaders have been pragmatic by continuing to highlight many regional countries’ main concern when it comes to Afghanistan: security.
Taliban leaders would, unsurprisingly, be pleased by such developments.","Four years after returning to power in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime marked the occasion as ‘Victory Day’ earlier this month. In the absence of any meaningful and sustained opposition, domestic or otherwise, the Taliban regime has consolidated its power in the years since 2021. Despite horrendous restrictions on women and girls, including a ban on female education beyond grade six, the Taliban regime’s power is buoyed by a combination of pragmatic, tacit and genuine endorsement at the regional level.

In April 2025, Russia’s supreme court suspended a ban on the Taliban, removing the group from Russia’s list of terror organizations. In July, Russia became the first – and so far the only – country to offer the Taliban government diplomatic recognition. Amir Khan Muttaqi, Taliban foreign minister, welcomed Moscow’s endorsement as ‘courageous’, arguing that this was simply accepting the reality in Afghanistan.

Reporting on Afghanistan has subsided as other conflicts, regions and issues have come to dominate headlines – except when it concerns Western domestic policy. Afghanistan returned to the UK news agenda when the Ministry of Defence admitted to dozens of data breaches concerning applications for relocation by Afghans who had worked with UK armed forces in Afghanistan.

The effects of sanctions

When the Taliban seized power, the internationally recognized government collapsed. The return of the Taliban and their self-proclaimed emirate (they officially refer to their government as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) in 2021 triggered the imposition of international sanctions because many Taliban leaders – now government officials – were on sanctions lists. These sanctions, primarily imposed by the UN and the US, are not aimed at Afghanistan as a country. Instead, they target individual Taliban leaders and entities, and predate the group’s 2021 return to power. The US under the Biden administration also froze around $7 billion of Afghan state reserve assets.

The result has been a crippling set of restrictions on Afghan institutions – including the banking sector – and the private sector. Sanctions have left Afghanistan isolated and without access to international financial institutions. Already one of the poorest and aid-dependent countries in the world, the sanctions have been devastating for ordinary Afghans.

Foreign development aid for Afghanistan’s long-term state-building efforts, infrastructure projects and development agendas is suspended. Instead, international assistance goes almost entirely to the humanitarian budget which the UN and other aid actors disperse so that – it is argued – international funds do not end up in Taliban hands. Humanitarian and UN agencies in the country have raised the alarm about mounting levels of acute malnutrition affecting children and the elderly. The situation has deteriorated further following the Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID, which has significantly reduced aid funding for Afghanistan.

Regional and international engagement

Afghanistan’s economic stagnation is partly linked to sanctions, but Afghanistan’s socio-economic crises predate the Taliban. With an estimated population of 40 million, Afghanistan has persistently ranked in the ‘low human development’ tier for decades. Lacking international legitimacy, Taliban leaders know they cannot afford unmanageable domestic resentment sparked by socio-economic pressures. This partly explains the Taliban regime’s continuing desire to engage with the United States and the West more broadly. Primarily, the Taliban would like to see Western engagement result in the unfreezing of Afghan state assets and the removal of sanctions – goals that warm relationships with countries like China and Russia have not achieved.

China and a host of other regional countries have established amicable relations with the Taliban government. But the financial vacuum left by the suspension of US-led Western development assistance remains unfilled. Taliban leaders have been pragmatic by continuing to highlight many regional countries’ main concern when it comes to Afghanistan: security. The Taliban government’s acceptance by regional states is a testament to the Taliban’s ability to project itself as the guarantor of security in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, Western engagement on Taliban terms is unlikely, as it will mean discarding serious concerns about human rights – particularly women’s rights – in Afghanistan. However, there are signs of a changing political mood in parts of Europe. Norway and Germany already host Taliban-appointed officials in Afghan diplomatic missions to support consular services, while Switzerland reopened its key development agency’s office in Kabul this week, insisting the country was keen to support humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan.

This increasing engagement with Afghanistan is driven both by an acceptance that the Taliban government is here to stay and by domestic pressures around migration in the West – especially a push to deport failed Afghan asylum seekers from Europe. Senior British opposition figures in the Conservative Party have indicated they would be open to engaging the Taliban to facilitate such deportations. Taliban leaders would, unsurprisingly, be pleased by such developments.

The city of Rochester this week codified its sanctuary city policy. The step underscores the city’s resolve, but it may offer little protection against an administration determined to dismantle sanctuary measures nationwide and threaten the loss of federal funds.

Sanctuary cities have existed in the United States since the Reagan administration—City Council declared Rochester a “City of Sanctuary” in 1986—but they have come under attack by President Donald Trump. Executive orders have signaled his intention to compel jurisdictions to withdraw sanctuary status.

Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that seek to protect the safety and well-being of all residents by limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, ensuring local resources remain focused on serving the community.

Rochester is not alone. It is among a group of cities, counties, and states that the federal government has targeted over the last several months, through lawsuits and threats.

The U.S. Department of Justice sued the city of Rochester in April as part of a nationwide effort to crack down on sanctuary municipalities. Similar lawsuits have been filed against New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, featuring a key argument: that sanctuary policies discriminate against federal immigration enforcement in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.

The Supremacy Clause establishes that the Constitution and federal law take precedence over conflicting state laws. While the federal government has used similar arguments in its lawsuits against sanctuary designations, they vary across cities, counties, and states. Cities like Chicago and New York explicitly refuse to detain individuals without a judicial warrant, and limit information sharing between local and federal agencies.

Rochester corporation counsel Patrick Beath’s initial response to the federal government’s lawsuit defends sanctuary policies under the 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering doctrine: that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states.

“Sanctuary laws like Rochester’s are some of the clearest examples of policies protected by the anti-commandeering doctrine of the Constitution, and basically what that says is that the federal government is free to do what is within their power to do,” says Peter Markowitz, professor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City. “What they are not free to do is to conscript states and localities to do their jobs for them.”

Rochester’s sanctuary policy, updated in 2017 to include the LGBTQIA+ community, affirmed that:

■ the Rochester Police Department shall not engage in activities solely for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement, including inquiring about or investigating and making arrests regarding the immigration status of an individual;

■ city personnel shall not inquire about or request proof of immigration status when providing services or benefits; and

■ the city shall not use its funds or personnel to enforce or assist in federal immigration enforcement.

The ordinance City Council approved this week codifies previous resolutions and provides additional protections. According to councilmembers, the sanctuary city ordinance:

■ empowers the city to engage in budgeting and policy making to provide material support to immigrants and LGBTQIA+ community members impacted by federal attacks and discrimination;

■ makes it unlawful for RPD to engage in activities solely for the purpose of immigration enforcement, therefore creating a legal course of action;

■ establishes a pathway for discipline and removal of city employees who violate sanctuary laws, including a process for investigation and public reporting;

■ prohibits the use of city personnel and resources for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement;

■ includes pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive autonomy as protected statuses, as outlined in the state Equal Rights Amendment;

■ affords equal rights to LGBTQIA+ individuals, including accessing school athletic activities and receiving full health care, including gender-affirming care;

■ bars the sharing of city records with federal authorities targeting people based on immigration status, gender identity, or reproductive choices; and

■ establishes that sanctuary city protections are now binding on all residents and businesses in the city, as they’re now codified into municipal code.

The City Council action comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have continued to make arrests in Rochester. Rochester Police Department officers directly aided ICE in a civil arrest in March. When border czar Tom Homan visited the Locust Club in defense of local law enforcement, his message to Rochester and Mayor Malik Evans was clear.

“End your sanctuary city policies,” Homan said. “Work with us on public safety threats and national security threats that are in the country illegally. Your number one responsibility is the protection of your communities.”

Taking action

Sanctuary city policies, John Harland Giammatteo contends, actually make communities safer.

“They’re policies that generally make communities safer by removing the concern for individuals within that community that they will be subject to immigration enforcement if, for instance, they report a crime or if they call the local police for some reason, either as a witness or as a victim of crime,” says Giammatteo, associate professor of law at the University of Buffalo School of Law. “The federal government is still free to do as much enforcement as it wants to do. It is free to use its resources for that.”

Studies continue to support an underlying motivation behind sanctuary jurisdictions: that they promote trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. A 2013 University of Illinois at Chicago survey of 2,004 Latino individuals living in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix found that 44 percent of those surveyed said that increased local police involvement in immigration enforcement made them less likely to contact police officers if they were the victim of a crime for fear of inquiry into immigration status. Nearly half of those surveyed stated that they were less likely to report a crime or voluntarily offer information about it due to similar fears. And a 2017 study by the Center for American Progress concluded: “Crime is lower and economies are stronger in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties.”

“What we have seen over and over again is that when police departments, local police departments, are engaged in routine immigration enforcement, immigrant communities are afraid to come forward as witnesses and victims of crime, and that becomes an impediment to the police department’s primary law enforcement duty,” adds Markowitz. “Getting entangled in immigration enforcement undermines public safety and undermines the work of local police departments, which is why so many jurisdictions with robust immigrant communities have enacted laws like these to create a clear boundary between police and federal immigration authorities.”

In July, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed an amicus curiae brief in defense of Rochester, arguing that the police power reserved to states and their localities is protected under the principle of federalism, which grants distinct authority and autonomy to state governments. James and Beath follow a similar argument, contending that the 10th Amendment prohibits Congress from conscripting local officers and resources to assist with federal immigration enforcement.

“(An amicus curiae) basically means a ‘friend of the court’ brief,” explains Giammatteo. “These briefs provide additional perspectives, useful information, and often, you know, the views of another entity that isn’t a party to the lawsuit formally, but still might have some interest in it.”

Related briefs have been filed by the Immigration Reform Law Institute in support of the federal government, while the Ibero-American Action League, New Hope Free Methodist Church, Third Presbyterian Church, and Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies have submitted an amicus brief in defense of Rochester.

“I think it’s helpful to have the (state) attorney general on the side of Rochester … both Rochester and the attorney general’s arguments are quite strong,” says Giammatteo. “Sanctuary city policies are about that sovereignty within the state and locality, rather than instructing federal immigration officials to do one thing or the other. … It’s helpful to have New York on that, on the side of the defendants.”

While the trajectory of Rochester’s lawsuit remains unclear, U.S. District Judge Lindsay Jenskins dismissed a similar suit against Illinois, Cook County, and Chicago, arguing their sanctuary policies are protected under the 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering doctrine.

“This is not the first time the federal government and the Trump administration has attempted to unlawfully undermine local sanctuary laws and policies,” says Markowitz. “They’re going to continue to lose over and over again, because sanctuary policies rely upon the bedrock principle in our Constitution that the federal government cannot draft states and localities into the federal government service. … I would expect that (Rochester’s) lawsuit would be similarly resolved in that way in the coming months.”

The ruling in Chicago remains the first setback in the Justice Department’s lawsuits against sanctuary policies. It has not altered the federal government’s efforts to end the use of sanctuaries nationwide.

The federal threat

In August, the Justice Department published an updated list of sanctuary cities, counties, and states, aiming to identify and pressure local governments to withdraw their policies. That threat has grown substantially with a letter sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to officials in various sanctuary jurisdictions, including Evans.

The letter, arguing that sanctuary policies obstruct federal immigration enforcement, references Executive Order 14287 in directing the attorney general to evaluate federal funding that could be withheld from Rochester should it not withdra w its policy. Bondi’s letter also states that individuals using their official position to obstruct federal immigration enforcement may be subject to criminal charges, and gives Evans and other officials across the nation a deadline to comply: Aug. 19.

That deadline has passed, with little noise from Bondi or the Justice Department. A response from Beath further affirms the arguments made in the city’s lawsuit, before raising concerns of ethical violations against the attorney general for contacting Evans without consulting counsel beforehand.

“Given this pending litigation, you—as counsel for the government of the United States—should have no direct communication with my clients without my prior permission,” wrote Beath. “The City intends to continue to fully comply with federal law while vigorously preserving its local autonomy and rights under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.”

“I completely agree with the city’s letter,” says Lenni Benson, distinguished chair in immigration and human rights law at the New York Law School. “This DOJ is not behaving with the limits and traditions of most prior administrations, from Reagan to Trump’s first (term). This was a clear ethical violation due to the pending litigation.”

In Printz v. United States, a case decided in 1997, the Supreme Court held that the federal government could not issue directives requiring state governments to address particular problems, nor command their officers to administer federal regulatory programs. However, a decade earlier, the court ruled in South Dakota v. Dole that Congress could attach conditions to federal funds to encourage cooperation. The amount of conditional funding, however, could not be disproportionate or coercive.

“We’re seeing a pattern across multiple different subject areas where the Trump administration is attempting to use statutes and authorities in sort of new ways to both outwardly threaten entities, whether governments, organizations, or museums, with the threat of legal sanction,” says Giammatteo, “but also try to attempt to scare (them) into complying with the political objectives of the Trump administration.”

Bondi’s letter is not the first time the Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions. The president’s first term saw a similar executive order challenged and thwarted by a lawsuit from the city and county of San Francisco.

Last week, U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from following through on its threat to withhold funding. Preliminary injunctions—a form of temporary court order—only serve to prevent irreparable harm from happening before the court reaches a final decision on a lawsuit.

“It’s a good sign if you can get a preliminary injunction,” explains Giammatteo, “but it might not (be) the final word.”

Funds at stake

Should the Trump administration be successful in its lawsuit against Rochester, the city would stand to lose over $81 million in federal funding, most of which comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. While the city’s most recent annual comprehensive financial report indicates it received the largest proportion of funding from COVID-19-related relief, no new awards were issued in 2025. Without that, the city’s primary source of federal funding falls under the Community Development Block Grants, which are used to develop affordable housing.

The city’s use of CDBG grants and other HUD funding is detailed in annual action plans as well as five-year consolidated planning documents. The final 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan states funding is intended to provide low- and moderate-income households with viable communities. Eligible activities include housing rehabilitation and preservation, affordable housing development, and community facilities and improvements. An estimated 70 percent of funds go toward these activities

Similar threats have been levied against Monroe County after County Executive Adam Bello announced the county’s participation in a lawsuit against the federal government over the potential loss of $9 million in grant funding over DEI policies.

“Enough is enough,” said Bello during an Aug. 21 press conference. “Monroe County is not going to be put in a position where we’re either going to lose millions of dollars in infrastructure dollars that go to our airport, or dismantle perfectly legal programs that are constitutional, that we’re allowed to have, that are actually working, and that were created in a bipartisan, unanimous way.”

“This type of threat is more like dark periods in our history,” Benson observes, comparing the threats leveled by the federal government to similar attempts to scare the public into coercion during the Red Scare and Cold War era. “These are not moments of pride.”

Evans’ office and City Council President Miguel Meléndez declined to comment.

The response

While Boston and Chicago’s mayors have responded to the Trump administration in full-throated defense of their sanctuary city policies, Evans has remained silent on the issue since a press conference held after the March incident with RPD officers. That response has angered community advocates who seek greater accountability and transparency from their local leaders.

“I would like to see our City Council and our mayor be a lot more vocal in their defense of our immigrant communities, because we have such strong immigrant communities here,” says LGBTQ+ rights advocate Mickey Di Perna. “It’s just a matter of are they willing to put their money where their mouth is? Are they willing to stand up to Trump? Are they willing to go an extra mile for their community?”

Di Perna has been a primary influence on strengthened legislation that would codify sanctuary protections for immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities, developing the bill alongside progressive City Councilmembers Kim Smith, Mary Lupien, and Stanley Martin. Di Perna joined Martin last week in a public meeting to discuss the ramifications of the bill and provide context for the federal government’s opposition.

“In order for any of this to ever take effect, it’s never going to be by the goodwill of people in office,” said Martin last week. “It’s going to have to be through public pressure.”

The motivation behind codifying protections was heightened after the March incident and garnered vocal public support in the months leading up to Tuesday’s vote. A rally held last week before August’s Speak to Council session saw a variety of speakers and advocates call on their councilmembers to defend their community by passing an ordinance that would both provide financial support to affected immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities and give Council the power to investigate and discipline city officials who violate sanctuary policies.

“Rochester needs to do everything it can to strengthen the sanctuary city ordinance. That’s not going to end the fear of people in our city who feel the targets on their backs, but it will show them that they’re not alone. That this city won’t abandon them,” said Marie Evans at the Speak to Council session. “We all need to reject the normalization of government terror. Refusal to resist what’s happening isn’t caution, it’s collaboration.”

Tuesday saw the body unanimously vote to strengthen protections—a key victory for the progressive caucus of Council and associated advocacy organizations that helped author the final version of the bill. With an amendment and input from the New York Civil Liberties Union, sanctuary protections now move from a citywide policy to a codified ordinance that is enforceable.

“I think this happened because of movement building,” said Martin after Tuesday’s vote. “We had the immigrant groups, we had folks supporting LGBTQ rights, and we had folks who just organized for the general well-being of our community. And it happened because everyone came together, including Council.”

In support of the legislation Tuesday evening, Meléndez affirmed that Rochester’s decision to strengthen its sanctuary protections—a decision that has come with significant legal hurdles—represents a statement of values.

“I’ve been asked why the Latino community hasn’t been more vocal locally. The truth is, people are vocal every day, though not always in public spaces,” said Meléndez. “Tonight I have the privilege of speaking in a public space on their behalf. We are doing this because it matters. It is important for our community to know where their elected leaders stand.”

It is unclear how the ordinance will affect the federal government’s lawsuit against the city. Yet the choice to strengthen sanctuary protections, for Markowitz, represents a commitment to community.

“There’s an element of some states and localities seeing the kind of misguided, brutal and inhumane nature of federal immigration enforcement today and saying, ‘We won’t be a party to this’,” says Markowitz. “It is devastating our communities. It is devastating our families. It is leaving children without parents. It is leaving businesses without workers. And it is sending human beings into some of the most brutal foreign kind of torture prisons that exist on earth today. And there are communities and local jurisdictions that have said, ‘We refuse to be a party to that.’”

New York School of Law’s Benson notes that it is clear that Rochester does not aim to impede the activities of the Department of Homeland Security or thwart federal immigration enforcement altogether.

“The AG and others can try to misdirect public attention to the cities that are not patrolling the streets with ICE and CBP,” says Benson. “But that is a false story, and a dangerous one.”

The escalation in arrests, military mobilization and lawsuits, Benson believes, is part of a larger approach: terrifying the population into submission, whether through voluntary departure or otherwise. Should the federal government be successful, it would not be unlikely to request that RPD begin to arrest individuals for immigration violations, or always respond to specific questions DHS asks.

“This suit against Rochester is part of the desire to create an intimidated community,” says Benson. “(The) people of Rochester should be proud of their city and state for acting calmly and carefully.”

The Department of Homeland Security has asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” said Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Details about the administration's plans for Chicago remain scarce.

Mogle said no decisions have been made on the request, and that the base hasn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

Chicago Mayor Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have fought back, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he’s trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump.

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

Violent crime in the city has dropped significantly in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem.

In 2024, the city reported 573 homicides, the most of any U.S. city that year, according to the Rochester Institute of Technology. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by over 22% when compared with the same time period last year.

Authoritarians love the death penalty, and have long used it to repress not crime, but dissent.
Already, the National Guard in D.C. is carrying live weapons.
After declaring his “crime emergency” in D.C., Trump mandated a serious change in the mission of the National Guard.
A new Quinnipiac University national poll found that 56% of voters disapprove of the National Guard being deployed in D.C.","President Trump declared Tuesday that federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., should seek the death penalty for murders committed in the capital, claiming without explanation that “we have no choice.”

“That’s a very strong preventative,” he said of his decision. “I don’t know if we’re ready for it in this country, but we have it.”

Trump’s pronouncement is about much more than deterring killings, though. With speed and brazenness, Trump seems intent on creating a new, federal arrest and detention system outside of existing norms, aimed at everyday citizens and controlled by his whims. The death penalty is part of it, but stomping on civil rights is at the heart of it — ruthlessly exploiting anxiety about crime to aim repression at whatever displeases him, from immigration protesters to murderers.

This administration “is using the words of crime and criminals to get themselves a permission structure to erode civil rights and due processes across our criminal, legal and immigration systems in ways that I think should have everyone alarmed,” Rena Karefa-Johnson told me. She’s a former public defender who now works with Fwd.us, a bipartisan criminal justice advocacy group.

Authoritarians love the death penalty, and have long used it to repress not crime, but dissent. It is, after all, both the ultimate power and the ultimate fear, that the ruler of the state holds the lives of his people in his hands.

Though we are far from such atrocities, Spain’s purge of “communists” and other dissenters under Francisco Franco, Rodrigo Duterte’s extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers in the Philippines (though the death penalty remains illegal there) and the routine executions, even of journalists, under the repressive rulers in Saudi Arabia are chilling examples.

What each of those regimes shares in common with this moment in America is the rhetoric of making a better society — often by purging perceived threats to order — even if that requires force, or the loss of rights.

Suddenly, violent criminals become no different than petty criminals, and petty criminals become no different than immigrants or protesters. They are all a threat to a nostalgic lost glory of the homeland that must be restored at any cost, animals that only understand force.

“We have no choice.”

The result is that the people become, if not accustomed to masked agents and the military on our streets, too scared to protest it, fearful they will become the criminal target, the hunted animal.

Already, the National Guard in D.C. is carrying live weapons. With great respect to the women and men who serve in the Guard, and who no doubt individually serve with honor, they are not trained for domestic law enforcement. Forget the legalities, the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act, which should prevent troops from policing American citizens, and does prevent them from making arrests.

Who do we want these soldiers to shoot? Who have they been told to shoot? A kid with a can of spray paint? A pickpocket? A drug dealer? A flag burner? A sandwich thrower?

We don’t even know what their orders are. What choices they will have to make.

But we do know that police do not walk around openly holding their guns, and certainly do not stroll with rifles. For civilian law enforcement, their guns are defensive weapons, and they are trained to use them as such.

Few walking by these troops, even the most law abiding, can fail to feel the power of those weapons at the ready. It is a visceral knowledge that to provoke them could mean death. That is a powerful form of repression, meant to stop dissent through fear of repercussion.

It is a power that Trump is building on multiple fronts. After declaring his “crime emergency” in D.C., Trump mandated a serious change in the mission of the National Guard.

He ordered every state to train soldiers on “quelling civil disturbances,” and to have soldiers ready to rapidly mobilize in case of protests. That same executive order also creates a National Guard force ready to deploy nationwide at the president’s command — presumably taking away states’ rights to decide when to utilize their troops, as happened in California.

Trump has already announced his intention to send them to Chicago, called Baltimore a “hellhole” that also may be in need and falsely claimed that, “in California, you would’ve not had the Olympics had I not sent in the troops” because “there wouldn’t be anything left” without their intervention.

Retired Maj. Gen. Randy Manner, a former acting vice chief of the National Guard Bureau, told ABC that “the administration is trying to desensitize the American people to get used to American armed soldiers in combat vehicles patrolling the streets of America. “

Manner called the move “extremely disturbing.”

Add to that Trump’s desire to imprison opponents. In recent days, the FBI raided the home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a Republican who has criticized Trump, especially on his policy toward Ukraine. Then Trump attempted to fire Lisa D. Cook, a Biden appointee to the Federal Reserve board, after accusing her of mortgage fraud in another apparent attempt to bend that independent agency to his will on the economy.

On Wednesday, Trump wrote on social media that progressive billionaire George Soros and his son Alex should be charged under federal racketeering laws for “their support of Violent Protests.”

“We’re not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more, never giving it so much as a chance to “BREATHE,” and be FREE,” Trump wrote. “Soros, and his group of psychopaths, have caused great damage to our Country! That includes his Crazy, West Coast friends. Be careful, we’re watching you!”

Consider yourselves threatened, West Coast friends.

But of course, we are already living under that thunder. Dozens of average citizens are facing serious charges in places including Los Angeles for their participation in immigration protests.

Whether they are found guilty or not, their lives are upended by the anxiety and expense of facing such prosecutions. And thousands are being rounded up and deported, at times seemingly grabbed solely for the color of their skin, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arguably the most Trump-loyal law enforcement agency, sees its budget balloon to $45 billion, enough to keep 100,000 people detained at a time.

Despite Trump’s maelstrom of dread-inducing moves, resistance is alive, well and far from futile.

A new Quinnipiac University national poll found that 56% of voters disapprove of the National Guard being deployed in D.C.

This week, the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. for a second time failed to convince a grand jury to indict a man who threw a submarine sandwich at federal officers — proof that average citizens not only are sane, but willing to stand up for what is right.

That comes after a grand jury three times rejected the same kind of charge against a woman who was arrested after being shoved against a wall by an immigration agent.

Californians will decide this in November whether to redraw their electoral maps to put more Democrats in Congress. Latino leaders in Chicago are protesting possible troops there. People are refusing to allow fear to define their actions.

A new detention facility, with plans to be the biggest in the country, is now open on a military base in Texas.

On the outskirts of El Paso’s Fort Bliss, you can see a sprawling tent city taking shape. It is President Trump’s newest immigration detention facility — Camp East Montana. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said she recently toured the site, which opened earlier this month and currently houses nearly 1,000 adults.

“I am very concerned that there are not enough Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel who have been trained by the federal government and have done this for a living for their full career. I'm concerned that there are not as many federal personnel on site to provide oversight as we should have,” Escobar said at a press conference.

“We have limited resources in our community, and this is definitely a strain on local resources, whether they be medical resources or utility resources,” she continued.

The Trump administration says the detention center will eventually hold 5,000 undocumented immigrants, which would make it the country’s largest immigration detention center.

“The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to Spectrum News.

Reportedly, Camp East Montana will cost $1.26 billion.

“I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans,” Escobar said. “There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration.”

The president’s signature policy law spends big on his immigration and border security agenda. It includes more than $150 billion over the next four years, with $45 billion to build immigration detention centers. All the Texas Republicans in Congress backed it.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, recently visited the facility, which he dubbed the Lone Star Lockup.

“There will be whatever we need in order to restore the rule of law and order to our immigration system,” Cornyn told journalists.

He said he is confident ICE will operate the site humanely and safely. Cornyn said Trump is following through on what he campaigned on, removing those with no legal right to be in the country.

""Many of my Democratic colleagues said we needed to pass new laws in order to control the border, when the truth is we needed a new president,"" Cornyn said.

The El Paso County Republican Party chairman, Michael Aboud, agreed.

“It's good for the state of Texas and for the nation as a whole, because that facility gives law enforcement the ability to bring people who are here illegally, a central location that they can keep track of them. It also is good for the immigrants, because it gives them a safe place to be while they're waiting to go back home,” Aboud told Spectrum News.

The Trump administration is seeking to more than double the number of immigrants it can hold in detention facilities to at least 100,000 people.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens. The One Big Beautiful Bill has provided historic funding to help us carry out this mandate,” a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to Spectrum News.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP25056853696997_Cropped,N,,2025-08-28 11:59:26.053092

The Department of Homeland Security has asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” said Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Details about the administration's plans for Chicago remain scarce.

Mogle said no decisions have been made on the request, and that the base hasn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

Chicago Mayor Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have fought back, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he’s trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump.

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

Violent crime in the city has dropped significantly in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem.

In 2024, the city reported 573 homicides, the most of any U.S. city that year, according to the Rochester Institute of Technology. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by over 22% when compared with the same time period last year.

The Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence has long provided legal help to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking.

Effective June 30, however, the nonprofit’s immigrant legal clinic permanently closed after the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs, which decides how to allocate federal crime victim dollars, ended immigrant legal aid grants.

Jennifer Escue, the coalition’s CEO, said the elimination of grants will leave already vulnerable victims with few legal alternatives.

“The major concern is that this just drives these communities deeper underground,” Escue said. “They’re not going to get help, they’re not going to report and it’s one more thing their abusers can hold over them.”

The organization’s legal clinic provided victims without legal immigration status help in applying for special visas set aside for domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking victims who are cooperating with police.

Visas that provide temporary legal status – and a pathway to lawful permanent residence – have long been made available to certain crime victims, in part so they are willing to help law enforcement pursue perpetrators without fear of deportation.

Visas are also made available to victims out of a recognition that an abusive spouse may hold the key to a partner’s immigration status as a sponsor of their immigration application, or may be using the threat of reporting a victim to immigration authorities as a tool to buy silence about the abuse.

Escue’s organization provided legal services and representation to about 150 new victims each year and ongoing legal work for 400 to 500 others through a visa petition process she said can take a decade or more to complete.

The loss of the funding – $137,000 annually for the coalition – comes as other immigration lawyers and legal organizations experience crushing demands and wait lists amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, leaving victims with few alternatives.

“We had to refer them to new representation which is of course difficult to find, because there were never enough immigrant legal services, especially low cost or, in our case, free.” Escue said.

Emily Stotts, legal director for the nonprofit Justice for our Neighbors, said her nonprofit organization already had a high volume of immigrant victims when the coalition’s legal clinic closed. They are now seeing some of the coalition’s former clients, she said.

“We still have to turn away a lot of people who are seeking assistance especially through the U visa,” which was established as a pathway to legal immigration status for victims in order to help law enforcement investigate and prosecute crimes.

Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

“We already had a capacity issue and this is aggravating the capacity issue,” Stotts said.

Asked to provide a reason for the grant funding cut, Jennifer Brinkman, executive director for the Office of Criminal Justices Programs, said the “contract which provided this funding had reached its end date and was not renewed.”

But the decision to end funding for immigrant legal services comes as the Trump administration attaches more strings to federal Victims of Crime Act funding that federal officials have explicitly said are in support of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Among them is a new requirement that states receiving the funding, and the nonprofits that accept it, cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.
Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases.
At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18.","WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation’s largest immigration detention complex, it didn’t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it's classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump's administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn't authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics' past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group CEO George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn't name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn't partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.

Hospitals are the latest location where ICE agents have attempted to carry out immigration detentions.
Velasquez said fear often discourages migrants from seeking care, but she says nothing is more important than their health and wellbeing.
The California Hospital Association said a statement to NBC 7, in part, “There is a special trust between patients and health care providers, and no one should ever be afraid to seek care for themselves or their loved ones because they fear being deported.”","As the Trump administration ramps up mass deportations, the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents has become more common at hospitals.

“One thing is for sure. Places that were off limits before for Border Patrol agents or ICE agents are no longer off limits,” certified immigration specialist Lilia Velasquez said.

Velasquez has dealt with a wide range of immigration cases, but there’s one that is hard for her to forget.

“I’ve had a case where the person was diabetic, was doing dialysis, but had no medical insurance, and he had an order of deportation,"" Velasquez said. ""They went to the hospital, and they wanted to disconnect them from the dialysis machine, saying, 'We’re going to deport you right now.' I had to go speak with the agents and say, 'You cannot do that. Don’t you have a heart? This person is going to die. You cannot unplug him.'""

Hospitals are the latest location where ICE agents have attempted to carry out immigration detentions.

“I’m not aware of that situation happening yet, but it’s important for hospital personnel to understand what the limits are of what agents can and can’t do when they enter a hospital,” immigration advocate Pedro Rios said.

According to the California Hospital Association, California and federal health information privacy laws prohibit hospitals, doctors and other health providers from disclosing patient information to ICE officers, unless the patient signs a form authorizing the release of information or the officer provides a valid subpoena or judicial warrant signed by a judge.

Rios said patients with a precarious immigration status have the right to request that their personal information remains private, but there is still a level of risk involved.

“One way that federal agents may go around that is if they know that the person they are looking for is at the hospital is they could obtain a judicial warrant that would allow them then access to a hospital room where the person they are looking for is currently at,” Rios said.

In a statement to NBC 7, Sharp Health said in part, ""Existing California laws protect all individuals’ rights to access medical care, regardless of their immigration status, and Sharp Staff are trained in policies relevant to law enforcement interactions within our facilities.""

Velasquez said fear often discourages migrants from seeking care, but she says nothing is more important than their health and wellbeing.

“A person should not die because they’re afraid to go to the clinic, or to see the doctor, or to the emergency room,” Velasquez said.

Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps.","B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.

B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.

But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.

“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”

SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.

“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.

“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.

Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.

But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.

They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.

“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”

Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.

“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.

‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.

Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.

“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”

According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.

In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.

The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.

“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.

“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”

‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.

Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.

“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”

Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.

Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.

“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.

In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.

The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.

Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.

“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”

B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.

“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/refugees-SNAP.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 07:57:07.116484

He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.
Signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III in the District of Maryland, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court.
The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.
Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.","A federal judge on Aug. 26 threw out the Trump administration‘s lawsuit against Maryland’s entire federal bench over an order by the chief judge that stopped the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Cullen granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

The White House had no immediate comment.

Cullen was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020. He sits in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies.

Cullen expressed skepticism of the lawsuit during a hearing in August. He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.

Signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III in the District of Maryland, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

The lawsuit was an extraordinary legal maneuver, ratcheting up the administration’s fight with the federal judiciary.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” attorney Paul Clement said during the hearing. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/05/TRUMP-EXITING-PLANE-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-08-28 08:56:17.790911

“This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.","A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.

When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk, and the court itself.

Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”

But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 37-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right — express or implied — to litigate that grievance in this manner.”

“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.

The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.

It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.

On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interfered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.

“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”

But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.

“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”

“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”

Stunt?

Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.

“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity … Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”

Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”

“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”

Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.

“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.

Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.

“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.

“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/maryland-IMG_7527-2048x1720-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 10:56:48.849688

It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”

“This morning I received a call that there is the potential to also support National Guard units.

In June, 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were deployed in Los Angeles to quell protests against federal immigration arrests, according to the Associated Press.
Federal agents would be given control of Building 617, which houses the Navy College Learning Center and the Morale, Welfare and Recreation Library, according to Yargosz’s email.","Federal immigration agents and possibly National Guard troops would operate out of a suburban naval base for much of next month as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to target Chicago, officials have been told.

Agents with the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection would be housed at Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago from Sept. 2-30, according to an email Monday from Navy Cpt. Stephen Yargosz to his leadership team.

“These operations are similar to what occurred in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Same DHS team,” wrote Yargosz, the commanding officer of Naval Station Great Lakes. “This morning I received a call that there is the potential to also support National Guard units. Not many details on this right now. Mainly a lot of concerns and questions.”

He said the operation would focus on “downtown Chicago,” and a formal “request for assistance” still required approval from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Two sources with knowledge of the email confirmed it’s authentic.

Local leaders in the dark

Trump has threatened to send troops to Chicago to get a handle on what he has characterized as rampant crime and lawlessness — a move that Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have deemed unnecessary given that crime has fallen significantly.

Pritzker, Johnson and Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they hadn’t gotten any information about the planning.

“We know that Donald Trump bringing in ICE and other federal enforcement to Chicago isn’t about ‘law and order’ because he is once again refusing to coordinate with our local officials,” said Duckworth, a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who lost her legs in an attack on her helicopter during the Iraq War.

“Forcing the military, uninvited, into Chicago to intimidate Americans in their own communities does not make our nation stronger, it simply distracts the military from executing its core mission of keeping Americans safe from real adversaries who wish us harm. It’s yet another unwarranted, unwanted and unjust move straight out of the authoritarian’s playbook that will only undermine our military’s readiness and ultimately weaken our national security.”

Durbin said state and local leaders “have not asked for or consented to President Trump bringing in the military to ‘save’ our city.”

“And now he reportedly wants to further abuse his power, waste government resources, and undermine military readiness by using Naval Station Great Lakes as a center of his operation in Illinois,” Durbin said. “May I remind the President that deploying the military to Chicago, and derailing critical operations at Naval Station Great Lakes, would be both unhelpful and illegal.”

At a news conference Wednesday, Pritzker acknowledged he had “received no calls from the White House, from the federal government, from anybody who might be in charge of some sort of troop movement.”

“We only know so much,” he said. “Right now, it’s hard to tell. We haven’t seen troop movements yet. We also haven’t seen any call up of our National Guard. But we are on guard, hoping that that does not happen.”

A DHS spokesperson wouldn’t answer questions, but claimed the Trump administration is “going to make our streets and cities safe again.”

“Across the country, DHS law enforcement are arresting and removing the worst of worst including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists that have terrorized American communities,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Under [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem, ICE and CBP are working overtime to deliver on the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.”

The White House wouldn’t comment, deferring to immigration officials. ICE, CBP and the Defense Department didn’t respond to questions.

In recent days, Trump has vacillated between bluster, disparagement and deference to Pritzker. The president renewed his threats on Tuesday, saying Pritzker should be asking for his support — just a day after he said he wouldn’t send federal resources unless the governor requested help.

“I’m not a dictator, I just know how to stop crime,” Trump said at a televised cabinet meeting. “But [Pritzker] should be calling me and he should be saying, ‘Could you send over the troops, please? It’s out of control.’”

Pritzker, Johnson and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul have said they are exploring all legal options in the face of a possible federal deployment to Chicago.

Trump has already federalized the police force in Washington, D.C. and has deployed federal law enforcement agents and thousands of National Guard troops, some carrying firearms, to the nation’s capitol to make stops and arrests.

In June, 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were deployed in Los Angeles to quell protests against federal immigration arrests, according to the Associated Press. Between 250 and 300 guard troops remain and have been activated through November, though California has sued the Trump administration over the deployment.

Questions about legality

Chicago was top on Trump’s list as a potential next target for a military takeover, along with several other Democrat-led cities, such as New York and Baltimore. The Washington Post recently reported that the Pentagon had been planning a military intervention in Chicago for weeks.

The scale and legality of the planned operation and the role of staff at the base remained unclear, according to a source with knowledge of the planning

Another source familiar with the plan told the Sun-Times about 30 to 40 ICE agents had been practicing riot control tactics at the military installation for months, using flash-bang grenades and marching in phalanxes with shields. The source said the planned operation would likely involve more agents than had been previously running drills, noting that the barracks can house 200 people.

Federal agents would be given control of Building 617, which houses the Navy College Learning Center and the Morale, Welfare and Recreation Library, according to Yargosz’s email.

He told his staff to “stay clear of DHS vehicles and equipment and act professionally.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf8c0ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F46%2F25%2F074c78e94baab6c4d773b4986ddf%2Ficenavy-082725-15.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 11:59:53.559414

Canada must be committed to upholding human rights and restoring justice in the immigration system.

Over the past year, the federal government has rolled out a series of policy changes that tighten and securitize every major immigration stream—decisions which deepen long-standing inequities in the system. Racialized migrants and refugees, women, 2SLGBTQI+ people and disabled persons, many of whom rely on community sponsorships, open work permits or low-wage streams, now face longer family separations, greater precarity and heightened surveillance.

Over the last two decades, Canada moved decisively towards “two-step” immigration. It does so by selecting permanent immigration candidates primarily from among temporary study and work permit holders. The cumulative effect is an immigration and refugee architecture that claims to celebrate diversity while operationalising exclusion, reinforcing historic patterns of racism and structural disadvantage—even as Canada brands itself an immigration success story.

By entrenching precarity and racialized gatekeeping, Canada undermines its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The federal government must re-align its migration framework with human rights principles, equity, and global justice.

Overview

Federal policymakers introduced extensive changes to immigration rules over the past 12 months. In September 2024, Ottawa announced a two-year cap that will cut new study-permit approvals to 437,000 for 2025 and curtail spousal work-permit eligibility, part of a wider plan to drive the share of temporary residents from seven per cent down to five per cent of Canada’s population. The October 2024 Immigration Levels Plan lowered permanent-resident targets by almost 20 per cent (to 395,000 in 2025) and formalised ceilings on temporary residents , while January 2025 allocations imposed a further 10 per cent drop in study permits. Other measures restricted open work permits for spouses and dependants of most international students and low-wage workers (Jan 2025). These shifts have left thousands of students and workers scrambling for status, as asylum claims by international students alone jumped 22 per cent in the first quarter of 2025 as other pathways closed.

Policymakers simultaneously narrowed refugee streams, implementing a temporary pause on private “Groups of Five” sponsorships (in which five Canadians together can “sponsor” a displaced person) from November 2024 to December 2025. Expired Refugee Protection Claimant Documents were declared invalid after April 2025, adding paperwork hurdles for people already waiting years for hearings. Ottawa simultaneously launched a multilingual digital campaign warning potential claimants about Canada’s “difficult” asylum process, and granted officers new powers to cancel visas, study permits and work permits on the spot (Feb 2025).

Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act introduced on 3 June 2025, would dramatically expand executive control over immigration. It proposes to grant cabinet the authority to pause, terminate or cancel entire classes of applications (as opposed to individual cases) or existing immigration documents “in the public interest,” and introduces stringent new requirements on the timing limits for making certain refugee claims. The bill also bolsters cross-border intelligence-sharing, lets Canada Post and CBSA open mail, and gives the Coast Guard police-style enforcement powers.

Canada also continues to be a signatory to the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), which bars asylum seekers from making refugee claims if they have already set foot in a designated safe country—a designation it applies the U.S., despite that country having closed nearly all refugee intake streams. Despite the U.S. government’s recent predilection to send migrants to overseas concentration camps in places like El Salvador, Djibouti, and Guantanamo Bay, the Canadian government continues to designate the U.S. as a “safe” country for refugees—effectively preventing large numbers of asylum seekers from making legitimate claims in Canada.

Actions

Refugee protection and asylum

The AFB will rescind the Canada–U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA). The agreement undermines equitable refugee protection; the U.S. is not a safe country for all asylum seekers.

The AFB will withdraw Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act.

The AFB will end immigration detention. In the interim, the AFB will implement alternatives to detention, such as community-based supervision models managed in partnership with non-profit organizations.

Status and regularization

The AFB will launch a comprehensive regularization program for everyone with undocumented or precarious immigration status—including a one-step Permanent Residency pathway for undocumented individuals, rejected claimants, and people on precarious temporary status.

The AFB will restore permanent-resident targets and dismantle the “two-step” system. It would reverse the shift to mass temporary migration.

The AFB will reinvest in robust humanitarian, family-class, and economic immigration.

The AFB will guarantee permanent-status-on-arrival and open work permits for all workers.

The AFB will guarantee a predictable permanent residence pathway for study permit holders who were made ineligible because of immigration policy and regulation changes.

The AFB will eliminate closed/employer-specific permits for all foreign worker programs, including temporary foreign workers, to ensure labour mobility and full legal protection.

Labour rights and mobility

The AFB will establish binding national employment standards and housing regulations for migrant agricultural and low-wage workers as recommended in the guidance document, “National Housing Standards for Migrant Agricultural Workers.”

The AFB will ensure full access to federal benefits and social insurance (such as Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, and so on, for all contributors regardless of immigration status, including migrant workers.

Justice and due process

The AFB will reform criminal inadmissibility and end immigration consequences of minor charges or protest-related arrests.

The AFB will introduce humanitarian discretion, a right of appeal, and a ban on deporting anyone brought to Canada as a child, regardless of immigration status.

The AFB will mandate an independent racial-equity audit of the entire immigration and refugee system.

The AFB will investigate systemic disparities in approval rates by country of origin, particularly for African, Caribbean, and Black applicants. As a result of that study, the AFB will mandate corrective measures, transparency, and binding equity reforms at IRCC and partner agencies as needed.

Health and human rights

The AFB will guarantee universal, provincial/territorial health coverage and treatment to all migrants living in Canada regardless of immigration status, including for people who are undocumented.

The AFB will guarantee culturally informed mental-health coverage and services to all migrants living in Canada regardless of immigration status, including for people who are undocumented.

The AFB will legislate national standards for Interim Federal Health Program and direct provider compensation to remove barriers to care and treatment for refugees and refugee claimants.

The AFB will protect and invest in legal aid, settlement agencies, and migrant worker support centres.

System reform and international commitments

The AFB will eliminate IRCC application backlogs and meet timely processing standards.

The AFB will create a new oversight body for Canada Border Services as per Bill C-20, An Act establishing the Public Complaints and Review Commission which received royal assent in October 2024.

The AFB will reverse IRCC staffing cuts, modernize systems, and publish regular processing metrics with disaggregated demographic data to ensure timely access and transparency.

The AFB will ratify the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Migrant Workers Convention (No. 97), the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143) and Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189).

The AFB will reaffirm Canada’s global commitment to migrant rights and align domestic policy with international human rights obligations.

Settlement services

The AFB will adopt a National Plan for Asylum with Dignity. It will model refugee reception on the holistic support provided to Ukrainians in 2022-23, including intake centres, immediate work permits, and federal housing/shelter support.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CCPA-Site-Image.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 04:57:36.911411

Jose de Jesus Ortega, 38, of Highland and Danielle Nadine Davila, 33, of Corona have been charged with assaulting, resisting and impeding a federal officer, a felony, according to a news release Wednesday from the U.S. attorney’s office for the Central District of California. A trial date has been scheduled for Oct. 6.

Ortega and Davila were charged last month by the U.S. attorney’s office on the same matter. By returning an indictment, the grand jury indicated that it believed federal prosecutors had proved that there is probable cause the defendants violated federal law and that the case can proceed to trial.

According to court documents, two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were conducting raids in Ontario on July 8 while wearing government-issued equipment, including law enforcement vests, the release states.

The agents followed a truck with three men inside and approached them after the men exited the truck in the parking lot of the surgery center, according to the release. Two of the men ran away; one of them, an allegedly unauthorized immigrant from Honduras, was detained near the facility’s front entrance and tried to pull away, causing him and the ICE officer to fall to the ground.

A medical staffer helped the landscape worker off the ground and pulled him away from the officers, according to the release. The man went into the surgery center and was chased by the ICE agent, who eventually stopped him.

According to video obtained by KTLA-TV Channel 5, staffers told the two agents to leave because they didn’t have a warrant to enter the property. The agents were trying to detain 30-year-old Denis Guillen-Solis and two other landscapers, according to the release.

In the video, Guillen-Solis is shown holding onto the doorway at the surgical center and asking the agents to present identification. The agents then pulled Guillen-Solis from the doorway and detained him.

Davila allegedly interfered with the arrest by wedging herself in front of the officer and saying, “Let him go!” and, “Get out,” according to the release. Ortega allegedly interfered by grabbing the officer’s arm and vest.

Another ICE officer arrived to help and allegedly saw staff members grabbing one of the officers, according to the release. They detained and handcuffed the alleged unauthorized immigrant.

Bertran suffered a broken finger, along with other injuries, while protesting a July raid at Glass House Farms in Camarillo.

Bertran, who plays guitar and piano, claims immigration agents hit him with less-lethal rounds numerous times, with one of the projectiles hitting his hand and breaking his left ring finger.

""I did not interfere. I stood where I was allowed to stand, and I made my voice known,"" Bertrand said at the news conference. ""I was more than happy to tell them what I thought about them, but that's within my right. I did not interfere in any way. We just stood there and peacefully assembled.""

Civil rights attorney James DeSimone is representing Bertrand in his lawsuit against DHS, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

During the raid, immigration agents fired tear gas and non-lethal rounds at protesters.

Bertrand's legal team says immigration agents were supposed to give the protesters a warning that they were going to fire tear gas and non-lethal rounds into the crowd.

""No warning was given to those individuals,"" DeSimone said. ""Alec Bertrand did not know that he was going to be shot five times in a matter of 15 seconds when he was standing there protesting the activities.""

Alec Bertrand added, ""They created a war zone that day. A war zone in a peaceful farming town in a California suburb.""

The foundation and a coalition of partners launched the Ventura County Neighbors Support Fund in late July to support families and small businesses.","After two meetings, hours of testimony and emotional pleas for support, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week rejected calls to provide attorneys and funds for immigration legal services.

The proposals to invest in legal assistance for local residents drew big crowds to the board's Ventura chambers on Aug. 12 and – after the initial meeting was continued – Aug. 26. Hundreds spoke to supervisors or submitted comments. Most urged support.

But the board, citing financial and other concerns, rejected nearly all the actions that Supervisor Vianey Lopez brought forward in response to widespread immigration raids. Lopez, who immigrated to the U.S., moving to Oxnard at 4, said the county relies heavily on an immigrant and undocumented workforce.

""At what point do we stand up for what is right?"" Lopez asked before the board voted.

Locally, hundreds have been detained since January, including during a July raid at Glass House Farms, a cannabis farm near Camarillo. Legal representation can be a barrier for those detained and their families, local nonprofit groups have said. But some cannot find an attorney or afford what can be costly representation, despite what could be valid avenues to stay in the country.

Before voting, supervisors listed concerns, including steep cuts facing the county's budget and other needs. Supervisor Matt LaVere, however, called $250,000 for a legal aid fund, one that would be set up by the Ventura County Community Foundation, a small ask. He would support the contribution, he said.

""We have to be honest about the storm clouds kind of hovering over our budget,"" LaVere said at this week's meeting. ""But at the same time, I think we all recognize what is happening right now to many in our community.""

He called the current immigration system complex, expensive to navigate and broken in many ways. Without legal guidance, people have no chance, he said.

""I don't view this as fighting the federal government. I don't view this as standing up against the administration,"" he said. ""I really view this as helping people know their rights and helping people stay in this workforce, which we so desperately depend on.""

What proposals did county supervisors consider?

Lopez had proposed a series of actions. She also asked the board to agree to waive her salary increase over the next two years to help pay for the fund. The list of proposals included:

Setting up an immigration legal assistance fund and approving $250,000 for the fund.

Establishing an immigrant defense unit in the county Public Defender’s Office, which would include seven positions for a fixed term. The estimated annual cost would total nearly $1.3 million.

Directing the County Executive Office to work with county counsel to prepare policies and train staff regarding access and use of county facilities by federal officers engaging in immigration enforcement.

Adding immigration-related issues to the county's state and federal legislative agenda and platform.

On Aug. 26, the board voted unanimously to support additions to its state and federal legislative agenda after changing some of the wording, and 4-1 to direct staff to finalize policies and training. Supervisor Janice Parvin opposed the latter motion.

Other proposals, including one to support an immigration unit failed to get to a vote. Supervisors also narrowly defeated Lopez's motion to contribute to a legal aid fund, which would have been set up at the community foundation. The board voted 3-2 in favor, but the item needed four ""yes"" votes to pass.

Parvin and Supervisor Jeff Gorell voted no. Gorell, who talked about budget challenges, said that if the community foundation created such a fund, he would personally donate but would have difficulty voting for taxpayer dollars to be spent.

Foundation CEO offers to match county funds

LaVere said the contribution likely would have a multiplying effect economically and other local jurisdictions, philanthropic donors and foundations likely would also support such a fund. He said the board needed to consider the economic impact of not doing something.

Vanessa Bechtel, the community foundation's president and CEO, called the situation a crisis locally, one that some may not recognize in their normal, day-to-day routines. People may not see the separated families or empty neighborhoods where people are too afraid to leave home, she said.

Partnering with local government could provide a signal to people that the county is in a crisis and people really need help, she said. She offered to try to first raise $250,000 to match the county's proposed contribution.

The foundation and a coalition of partners launched the Ventura County Neighbors Support Fund in late July to support families and small businesses. The fund focuses on helping with food, shelter and other basic needs, but not legal assistance, Bechtel said. A new fund could do that, officials said.

Parvin referred to herself as a fiscal conservative and described the county's budget as unpredictable. She listed increasing costs from health care to union contracts.

""I'm not trying to say the effort is not worth it, because it's great,"" Parvin said. ""I'm just saying I'm looking at this from a bigger picture, and from a budget standpoint, I have to look at this very conservatively.""

What happens next for a legal assistance fund?

During the meeting, some spoke out against the proposals, raising concerns about spending and questioning legal risks.

But most of the public comments urged the board to invest in an immigration legal defense team and fund, efforts some said were critical to support residents and to stop families from being separated.

The 805 Immigrant Coalition – 805 Undocufund, Mixteco/Indigena Community Organizing Project, the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy and other groups – supported Lopez's proposals.

After the hearing, Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of the local nonprofit 805 UndocuFund, called what happened ""a big slap in the face"" to the local community members who showed up for the hours-long meetings and asked supervisors to support the proposals.

Hernandez said the coalition would continue to talk to local cities. Bechtel, too, said discussions were ongoing with jurisdictions.

The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.

Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.

The administration has cast ""Alligator Alcatraz"" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys — allegations that federal and state officials have denied.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.

The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.

Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.

In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present ""new evidence"" showing the detainees at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.

""Alligator Alcatraz"" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially. A federal judge earlier this month dismissed one part of the suit that alleged the government had prevented detainees from filing legal challenges by not making clear which immigration court oversaw the facility, but he left the rest of the suit intact — though he moved the case from Miami to Orlando.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/20/b3882359-72fc-4928-bc4a-2b071da6af6c/thumbnail/1200x630/046d9e37d9355ed918d6e0d88c793143/gettyimages-2229637781.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 01:56:44.373901

If such a contract is in place, detainees are not subject a traditional 48-hour time limit for the state to hold subjects awaiting federal law enforcement.

Federal law allows the counties to enter the contracts, Yost said, and state law doesn’t prohibit it.

The net effect of the ruling is more counties could reach financial deals with ICE calling for them to hold people awaiting deportation in jail, even though immigration is a civil and not a criminal offense.

“Local officials’ authority to confine such persons in a county jail would derive, instead, from a lawful agreement with federal immigration authorities to detain aliens subject to removal from the United States,” he wrote.

Advisory opinions don’t carry the force of law, but they function as an important form of blanket advice for government actors who rely on legal counsel or services of the attorney general.

The request to Yost came at the behest of Michael Gmoser, the prosecuting attorney for Butler County, near Cincinnati. There, the county jail is holding about 400 people on “ICE detainers,” and 92% of them are only held on immigration offenses as opposed to violent ones, according to WCPO9.

Yost’s opinion comes with a wrinkle. It holds that only county commissions, not sheriff’s offices, can enter such contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The ACLU has previously filed lawsuits against sheriffs of Geauga and Seneca counties, claiming they’ve illegally refused to provide copies of their contracts to transport and house immigrants for ICE.

On Wednesday, attorneys with the advocacy group issued a letter to nine sheriffs around the state, warning them that only their county governments can contract with ICE. Such contracts with the sheriffs but not their county commissions would be “invalid,” the ACLU said.

“As Attorney General Dave Yost has made clear, these agreements were invalid at their inception and have no legal force,” wrote Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU. “For you to continue holding anyone under that invalid authority is unlawful, and a violation of these individuals’ constitutional rights.”

The ruling from Yost also comes as President Donald Trump’s administration wages an aggressive, mass deportation campaign across the nation that includes targeting those with no criminal records as well.

Yost’s writing deviates from a 2007 advisory opinion from his Democratic predecessor, Marc Dann. There, Dann opined that counties can only hold people for 48 hours (not counting Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) as a “detainer” until federal law enforcement claims custody of the person.

She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.
Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law.","This story was reported and written by our media partner the Virginia Mercury.

Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger says one of her first acts if elected would be to undo Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s February directive requiring Virginia law enforcement to help carry out federal immigration crackdowns — a policy she argues wastes local resources and undermines community trust.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February. The order gave state police and corrections officers authority to perform certain immigration duties and also urged local jails to fully cooperate with federal deportation operations.

The governor said at the time the measure was meant to keep “dangerous criminal illegal immigrants” off Virginia’s streets. Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.

“Our immigration system is absolutely broken,” she said. “The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources.”

Spanberger’s stance sets up a sharp contrast with her opponent — Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced the order and tied it to her own story as a legal immigrant from Jamaica.

The divide between the two candidates underscores how immigration has become one of the most combustible issues in Virginia’s 2025 campaign for governor — and how Youngkin’s policies continue to shape the race even as he prepares to leave office in January.

That influence stretches beyond Youngkin’s executive order. In late February, Youngkin also launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a sweeping federal-state operation staffed with more than 200 personnel from agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, state police and corrections, which has claimed hundreds to thousands of immigration and gang-related arrests in Virginia.

Keep enforcement federal, Spanberger says

Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in Congress before launching her gubernatorial bid, argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by federal officials with judicial oversight, not by local police diverted from their own duties.

She said Democrats are often wrongly portrayed as opposing law enforcement when they object to policies like Youngkin’s that conscript local agencies into immigration sweeps.

“If someone has a criminal violation at the state level or at the federal level … local resources are required to arrest that person or put them in a local jail before transferring them to federal custody. Absolutely the locality should participate in that,” she said.

But Spanberger insisted the standard should be the same for immigration cases as for any other criminal matter.

“They have to have a warrant to pick somebody up off the street, so they meet that same standard,” she said. “And they can easily go get that detention order signed by a judge or a magistrate, if they want that local support.”

Without those safeguards, Spanberger argued, local cooperation with ICE undermines community policing, creates constitutional concerns and strains already tight budgets. She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.

Earle-Sears emphasizes rule of law

Earle-Sears, who initially agreed to a similar policy interview with The Mercury but canceled minutes before it was to take place, has publicly and repeatedly defended Youngkin’s executive order.

“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the governor, attorney general, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said in February when announcing the policy. “Now, working with President Trump, we can take on the scourge of dangerous and violent illegal immigrants.”

In December, while unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal, she described the bureaucratic hurdles her own family went through when immigrating to the U.S. and argued that others should follow the same path.

“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States. Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state,” she said.

“The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America,” she added.

Earle-Sears’ broader ideas on immigration remain unclear, as she has not gone beyond a handful of public statements and her campaign website offers no issue page outlining her positions.

Dispute over Youngkin’s deportation claims

The candidates also diverge sharply on Youngkin’s claim in July that all 2,500 immigrants arrested and deported by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force are “violent criminals.”

Spanberger said she has seen no evidence to support the governor’s sweeping assertion.

“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed, in which case, there would be clear documentation,” she said. “Frankly, as somebody who believes in upholding the law, I want people to be arrested for the crimes that they are committing.”

Civil rights groups have also raised alarms, arguing that Youngkin’s mandate is “playing politics with people’s lives.”

“For years, Virginia’s governor has been pushing the same dangerous, false narrative as the Trump administration that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than people who were born here, despite the fact that no data exists to support that conclusion,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said in a statement.

Earle-Sears has not directly addressed the governor’s 2,500 figure but has frequently pointed to grim cases of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in arguing for tougher enforcement.

“We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this executive order will make sure we send them back to where they came from,” she said earlier this year.

The Laken Riley Act

The immigration debate has also touched on Spanberger’s record in Congress.

Earle-Sears has faulted her for initially voting against the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia college student killed by a Venezuelan national who entered the country unlawfully. The law, which eventually passed after Spanberger left Congress, requires federal authorities to detain immigrants accused of theft and burglary while their cases proceed.

Spanberger said she opposed the bill in its first iteration because it “was essentially putting incredible burdens on localities removing any form of due process” and would not have prevented Riley’s murder.

“As a mother of three daughters, I was deeply offended that they would utilize that young woman’s murder as a political talking point,” she said. “At the time of that vote, her father was in the press saying that he was deeply distressed by the fact that her murder was being utilized in the way that it was.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Spanberger has staked out a position that balances criticism of Trump-era immigration policies with support for reforms viewed as moderate.

“Spanberger has been fairly vocal in criticizing the Trump administration’s methods of dealing with undocumented immigration,” Richards said.

“Her voting record on bills centered around immigration has been mixed, supporting some of the more moderate bills, but voting ‘no’ on some key GOP bills like the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act. … It falls in line with her presenting herself as a pragmatic candidate.”

By contrast, he said, Earle-Sears has been relatively quiet on immigration, surfacing the issue primarily when it intersects with her biography or when amplifying President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“She did talk about the issue back in June, saying that she, as an immigrant, did things the ‘right way.’ But overall, she has skirted the issue,” Richards said.

“She may feel that the issue is not one she can really win with in Virginia, although, as more immigration related arrests happen in the commonwealth, she may have to start talking about this.”

The bigger picture

The fight over immigration in Virginia is inseparable from national politics. Youngkin has aligned himself closely with Trump on enforcement strategies, boasting of joint operations with ICE and staging press events around courthouse raids and “gang and immigration sweeps” that have drawn criticism from Democrats and civil liberties groups.

Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law. She cited bipartisan bills like the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and the Dignity Act as examples of incremental progress, even if they fell short.

“There are many places where the governors of states can bang on the table and tell Congress, ‘Stop making this such a political issue that you campaign on every two years and just fix it,’” she said.

She added that immigration is not only a humanitarian concern but also a pressing economic issue for Virginia, from hospitals seeking visas for foreign-trained nurses to seafood producers dependent on seasonal guest workers.

Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has emphasized border security and public safety, drawing a bright line between legal immigrants like herself and those who arrive unlawfully.

“Any local elected official who instructs law enforcement to defy efforts to keep Virginians safe abandons their duty and breaks the trust of the people they swore to protect,” she said last year.

Looking ahead

With polls showing immigration remains a top concern among Republican voters — and a complicated one among independents — the issue is likely to stay at the forefront of this year’s election cycle.

Spanberger is betting Virginians will see Youngkin’s executive order as overreach that diverts local resources and harms public safety by discouraging immigrant communities from reporting crimes. Earle-Sears is counting on voters to view strict enforcement as common sense, framed by her own story of navigating the legal immigration system.

“Maybe she is waiting for a Trump endorsement,” Richards said of Earle-Sears. “But if immigration remains in the headlines, she may not be able to avoid it.”

For now, voters face a stark choice between a Democrat who vows to unwind the governor’s crackdown and press Congress for broader reforms, and a Republican who pledges to double down on enforcement in the name of law and order.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f05e05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+173/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2F5d%2Fbf1159714b5a9ce90d9244144213%2Fimg-4799-1536x1152.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 10:56:53.223189

DHS issued a similar proposed rule in September 2020, toward the end of the first Trump administration.
And for I nonimmigrants, “duration of status” is generally the duration of the foreign media representative’s assignment/employment in the United States.
Some aspects of the proposed rule could be revised during the review and finalization process, based on public feedback.
If your organization wishes to comment on the proposed rule, please contact your designated Fragomen professional or the firm’s Government Strategies and Compliance Group.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released an advance copy of a proposed regulation that would replace the current “duration of status” (D/S) policy for international students (F status), exchange visitors (J status), representatives of foreign information media (I status), and their dependents with a policy that would set a finite expiration date for their authorized stay. The proposed rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register tomorrow. DHS will accept public comments on the proposal for 30 days after publication.

If the proposal becomes final, F, J, and I nonimmigrants would be admitted to the United States for a specific period of stay, and like other nonimmigrants, they would be required to apply for an extension of stay if they need more time to complete their program, employment, or assignment.

The proposed rule would also result in a change to current policies on how and when F, J, and I nonimmigrants begin accruing “unlawful presence,” for purposes of the three- and ten-year bars applicable to foreign nationals who have been unlawfully present in the United States for over 180 days or over one year. Currently, F, J, and I nonimmigrants only begin to accrue unlawful presence if USCIS or an immigration judge formally finds that the individual has violated their nonimmigrant status. Under the proposed rule, F, J, and I nonimmigrants would generally begin accruing unlawful presence as soon as their specified admission period expires, as is currently the case for other nonimmigrant categories.

DHS issued a similar proposed rule in September 2020, toward the end of the first Trump administration. The incoming Biden administration withdrew the proposal in July 2021, and the second Trump administration is now seeking to resurrect the initiative with additional provisions that have not previously been proposed.

While most nonimmigrants are admitted to the United States until a specific date, F, J, and I nonimmigrants have long been admitted for the duration of the individual’s status in that visa classification. Under current rules, a “duration of status” (D/S) admission for F-1s is the time it takes the individual to complete their academic program and any post-completion optional practical training (OPT), plus a 60-day grace period. For J-1s, “duration of status” is the time it takes the exchange visitor to complete their J-1 program, plus a 30-day grace period. And for I nonimmigrants, “duration of status” is generally the duration of the foreign media representative’s assignment/employment in the United States.

Nonimmigrants admitted for duration of status are not required to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS if their program or employment lasts longer than initially anticipated. For Fs and Js, the sponsoring educational institution or exchange program can extend the student’s or exchange visitor’s ability to remain in the United States simply by issuing a revised Form I-20 or DS-2019 with a later program completion date, and foreign media representatives in I status can remain in the United States as long as they remain employed in their qualifying employment.

The proposed rule would end this longstanding practice of admitting F, J, and I nonimmigrants for duration of status and would bring these classifications in line with other nonimmigrant categories, by subjecting them to defined periods of stay and requiring them to apply to USCIS for extensions of status if they wish to remain in the United States beyond that defined period.

If F, J, or I nonimmigrants require additional time to complete their program, practical training, or employment, they would need to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS and complete biometrics screening. The rules governing the duration of approved extensions would mirror the rules above for the initial admission periods.

The proposed rule indicates that in order for an extension of F-1 status to be approved, the foreign national would need to present either a currently issued Form I-20 indicating that additional time is needed to complete their program or documentation demonstrating compelling academic reasons (e.g., change of major or research topic, unexpected research problems, etc.); illness; or other circumstances beyond the foreign national’s control (e.g., natural disaster, national health crisis, closure of institution).

If an F, J, or I nonimmigrant fails to depart or apply to change or extend their status before their status expires, they would begin to accrue unlawful presence upon expiration of their authorized admission period, in the same manner as other nonimmigrants.

The proposed rule contains complex transition provisions for the treatment of foreign nationals admitted for duration of status (D/S) prior to the effective date of the rule.

After the rule is published in the Federal Register tomorrow, the public will have 30 days to comment. DHS will then review the feedback and prepare a final rule for issuance in the Federal Register. Some aspects of the proposed rule could be revised during the review and finalization process, based on public feedback. There is no set timeframe for publication of a final rule, though the process typically takes several months.

Comments from the academic and business communities will be important to make the agency aware of the impact of the rule on schools, businesses, and U.S. competitiveness in the market for global talent.

The Wednesday letter to State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln calls on Bosn to use her authority to call a hearing on the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp in McCook. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style, rehabilitative-focused prison facility into a 300-bed ICE detention facility over the next 45 days.

Pillen, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other state officials called the rebranded facility the “Cornhusker Clink.”

“There was no meaningful notice to the Legislature, local officials or the public about this agreement,” the senators wrote Wednesday in a letter shared publicly and with the Nebraska Examiner. “The governor’s disregard for including the Legislature — the people’s branch — is deeply problematic. Nebraskans deserve answers.”

Almost every legislative committee introduces a resolution each year to examine any issues that might arise between legislative sessions within a committee’s jurisdiction. Bosn’s committee has Legislative Resolution 108, which is signed by all eight committee members.

Bosn said she received the letter late Wednesday afternoon and was still reviewing it. She said she would have a response Thursday.

‘How democracy works’

Lawmakers signing the letter were State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Machaela Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Megan Hunt, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey.

“This is not about partisanship. It is about process, constitutional authority and protecting Nebraskans,” Hunt, a nonpartisan progressive, said in a statement. “The governor cannot secretly cut deals to hand over state facilities to ICE without public input or legislative oversight. That is not how democracy works.”

The other dozen lawmakers who signed are Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.

Asked for a response on the lawmakers’ letter, Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokesperson, said the lawmakers had not posed the questions to the Governor’s Office and that if the lawmakers want answers, they’re welcome to ask.

“The governor has always been transparent and would be more than happy to answer questions,” she said. “However, the administration cannot answer questions when they are not asked. Rather than engaging in political theater, these Democrat senators should simply send these questions to be answered.”

Three legislative Democrats did not sign the letter: State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and Jason Prokop of Lincoln. DeBoer is vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, which is split 5-3, majority Republicans. McKinney and Rountree also serve on the committee.

DeBoer could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

Hunt said on social media Wednesday that a reason some Democratic lawmakers didn’t sign was because of a “quick turnaround.” She said she thought there were “for sure” some Republicans who would have signed.

Nebraska’s plans to keep the repurposed Work Ethic Camp state-owned and operated would likely leave it open to legislative oversight, a power that lawmakers have worked to clarify and strengthen over the past two years.

Legal authority

Some of the lawmakers’ questions revolve around whether the governor has the authority to enter an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to convert a state prison into an ICE detention facility without legislative action. They also want to probe whether the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services can house ICE detainees at all.

The letter notes Article IV, Section 19 of the Nebraska Constitution, which gives the Legislature power over the “management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

Senators argued Pillen is “unilaterally” bypassing the Nebraska Constitution and multiple state laws that dictate the prison system’s powers and outline the purpose of the Work Ethic Camp in statute.

While the letter alludes to fiscal questions, lawmakers did not include any specific questions on the finances of the new facility.

Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, have said the federal government will fully reimburse Nebraska for the $9.5 million facility plus daily bed costs. They have said the deal could financially benefit Nebraska.

Previous Judiciary Committee reactions

Rountree, who represents a purple legislative district that elected him and voted for President Donald Trump in November, previously told the Examiner that he approaches immigration enforcement from a “humanitarian viewpoint” and from his 30 years as a veteran.

“There’s a place for the rule of law to exist along with humanitarian effort,” Rountree said.

What to know about Nebraska-ICE plan to retool McCook Work Ethic Camp

State Sens. Tanya Storer of Whitman and Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, who also serve on the Judiciary Committee, said they had been briefed on the federal plan and were more confident in its direction. Both said they were assured Nebraska facilities would not be hurt by the plan.

“I think if Nebraska is in a position to help be part of that effort in a positive way, that’s a good thing,” Storer said at the time.

Hearing requested with ‘deliberate speed’

Among the letter’s other questions Wednesday:

What impact does this agreement have on Nebraskans who are incarcerated and front-line prison system employees, who are already facing overcrowding and staffing issues?

Will employees at the Work Ethic Camp be reassigned to work at other facilities? Will they be trained to work at the converted facility? Will federal officials also work at the converted facility? Will federal officials replace or supplement current staff at the Work Ethic Camp?

Where will the incarcerated Nebraskans now housed at the Work Ethic Camp be moved to? How does the recent significant damage and forced relocation of inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary impact prisoner relocation efforts? What impact will the relocation have on rehabilitation-focused programming and eligibility for parole?

Who will be detained or placed in the converted ICE detention facility?

If Nebraska has prison space to give away to the Trump administration, why are state lawmakers spending more than $313 million to build a new state prison?

“These and other subjects are deserving of a public hearing on the record at which officials can provide additional information and answer questions, and where Nebraskans can be heard,” the letter states.

The senators asked Bosn, a former prosecutor appointed to the Legislature in 2023 and elected in 2024, to inform her colleagues and the public of the answers to these questions if she can.

If Bosn cannot answer, the letter adds, “We encourage you to stand in your power and set and publicize the hearing date to take this matter up with all deliberate speed as the governor notes this transition will be happening within a few short weeks.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/progressives-PSL-huddle_ZJW_032625-02.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 22:57:23.542704

Joshalin Rivera is accused of spewing the vile tirade as ICE and Border Patrol agents were making arrests at an apartment building on Chicago’s West Side on Sunday morning, according to a criminal complaint.

“I hope your kid dies a f–king miserable death, your f–king kid needs to get shot in the f–king face next bitch,” Rivera allegedly shouted at the agent.

“They lucky I ain’t got my s–t on me. I’d pop both of they ass… pop them right in their f–king face.”

Rivera was among a group of bystanders who swarmed the apartment building entrance just as the feds were trying to make the arrests, according to the filing.

It wasn’t immediately clear who authorities were trying to detain.

After the officers eventually moved inside the apartment, Rivera allegedly could be heard saying, “I’m busting all their f–king windows.”

Moments later, someone hurled a brick through a Border Patrol agent’s unmarked vehicle and shattered the glass, the complaint states.

A child developed a rash after he was prevented from changing his underwear for four days. A little boy, bored and overcome with despair, began hitting himself in the head. A child with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was forced to go without his medication, despite his mother’s pleas.

“I heard one officer say about us ‘they smell like sh–,’” one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. “And another officer responded, ‘They are sh–.’”

Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called “prison-like” settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services — including safe and sanitary conditions — for children held by the government.

The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.

With the agreement in place, children are being held in “unsafe and unsanitary” U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency’s written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants’ attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice’s May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.

“The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn’t stand for.”

The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.

The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.

In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.

The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to respond on the record to questions about the administration’s intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has “incentivized illegal immigration,” and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.

ICE detention facilities have the “highest standards,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. “They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.”

Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people’s homelands are driving them to move.

Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.

In 2016, President Barack Obama’s administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.

In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.

In 2024, President Joe Biden’s administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.

Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. “Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,” the filing said.

Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.

And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl’s medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother’s repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.

Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.

Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.

But with the Trump administration’s unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants — including families — the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.

“Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don’t see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,” said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith’s family.

Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.

Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.

“Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,” Hatoum said. “We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.”

In the months after Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS’ Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.

Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children’s Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden’s administration, too.

“These are not political issues for me,” Welch said. “How does our country want to treat children? That’s it. It’s very simple. I’m not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-28 05:57:03.095452

Mary Gay Scanlon (D-5th District) said she was denied entry to the largest immigration detention center in the northeast on Wednesday.

The privately operated Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Clearfield County was the subject of a high-profile complaint by civil rights advocates last year. Scanlon told the Capital-Star she has heard concerns about constituents from her suburban Philadelphia being held in the center under poor conditions including inadequate medical and mental health care.

“We’ve had reports about folks being unable to get adequate food. Either they were going hungry or they were … forced to purchase their own food from the commissary,” Scanlon said.

Despite a provision in a 2024 federal appropriations bill giving members of congress the authority to make unannounced oversight visits, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials refused her request to enter the facility.

“They said they would not be letting me in specifically to do the oversight visit, because they were under orders not to do so by the secretary of DHS Kristi Noem,” Scanlon said. “And they repeatedly said they were aware of the fact that there is a federal law.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on Scanlon being denied entry to the facility.

Scanlon is the second member of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation to be turned away by officials at Moshannon Valley this week. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-12th District) was denied entry to the center to conduct oversight after the death earlier this month of a Chinese national being held there.

Lee said in a statement Monday her denied entry into Moshannon Valley is an example of the Trump administration’s executive overreach.

“With numerous allegations of human rights abuses, our communities deserve to know how people are being treated inside these taxpayer-funded facilities,” Lee said. “Transparency and accountability are non-negotiables in a democracy, and ICE cannot be allowed to operate in the shadows.”

Similar scenes have played out at detention centers elsewhere in the nation in recent months. Notably, Democratic New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver and other lawmakers were involved in a confrontation with federal officials outside a recently reopened facility in Newark in May.

McIver was later indicted on three counts of “assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering” with federal officers, which she has said are politically motivated.

Moshannon Valley, which Scanlon said has recently housed between 1,200 and 1,700 people, is a former federal prison operated on behalf of ICE by private prison operator GEO Group. The company operates 97 facilities, including the one in Newark where McIver was denied entry.

GEO Group’s contract is with Clearfield County, which provides the space to ICE in an arrangement that circumvents a Biden-era ban on for-profit prisons.

Scanlon said the complaint the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Legal Services of New Jersey and the University of Pennsylvania law school filed with the Department of Homeland Security has not been resolved. That’s in part, she claimed, because the Trump administration gutted the DHS Office of Civil Rights that was handling it.

The Sheller Center for Social Justice at Temple University Beasley School of Law and the immigrant rights group Juntos also released a report last year based on interviews with 70 people held at Moshannon Valley.

It called for the center to be closed, alleging immigrants and asylum seekers are subject to physical and psychological abuse, lack adequate access to health care, and face retaliation for standing up against mistreatment.

“There are problems that we’re hearing about from a variety of sources, and that’s why we need to be able to get in there and see what the situation is,” Scanlon said.

Scanlon said federal immigration officials have historically been willing to work with members of Congress and advocates to address concerns about conditions in immigration facilities. With the Trump administration’s “rampant ramp up” of deportation and the Republican budget reconciliation bill adding $45 billion to ICE’s budget, Congressional oversight is more important than ever, she said.

“What we’re seeing now is, first of all, a total lack of transparency,” Scanlon said, noting that families, their lawyers and advocates are having difficulty locating people within the immigration system. “There’s a whole host of issues which, if you have transparency, you can then begin to address all of this,” she said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_8034-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 21:56:45.267876

Mike Kehoe is weighing a request from the Trump administration to deploy the state's National Guard to support federal immigration enforcement in Missouri.

If approved, Guard members would help handle administrative and logistical tasks for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — not arrests — according to Kehoe's spokesperson Gabby Picard.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said assistance could include case management, transportation and clerical support for the in and out processing of detainees without legal status.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested from the Trump administration.

The request follows a July 25 order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to bring members of military under the command of state governors and authorized them to support immigration enforcement. That adjustment added 500 troops to help the immigration agency, bringing total DoD support to about 1,700 service members.

Picard said Missouri is among 10 new states that could get that extra support. While federally funded, the Guard would remain under Kehoe's authority.

""By providing these crucial services, DoD military personnel directly enable ICE to dedicate more trained agents to core law enforcement activities, significantly enhancing overall effectiveness,"" said Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell in a statement. ""The Department of Defense is committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security in its mission to maintain the security of our borders and enforce immigration laws.""

As of Friday, 20 states — all led by Republican governors — were either carrying out ICE's request for troops or considering it, according to Stars and Stripes.

Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state's National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful. The Guard was ultimately not deployed.

""While other states may wait for chaos to ensue,"" the governor said at the time, ""the State of Missouri is taking a proactive approach in the event that assistance is needed to support local law enforcement in protecting our citizens and communities.""

The Guard deployment would mark the latest expansion of federal law enforcement's presence in St. Louis.

Last week, U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced the FBI would be getting extra staffing to help fight violent crime in the region.

The deployment of the National Guard to help ICE across the U.S. is separate from President Donald Trump's recent decision to send nearly 2,000 federal troops — and counting — to address crime in Democratic-led cities such as Washington, D.C.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials Wednesday denied U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Delaware County, entry to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.

A Chinese citizen died in early August while in custody inside the ICE facility. Scanlon said she was there to conduct a congressional oversight visit.

“The private prison director and the ICE manager for the facility came out and told me they knew there was a federal law requiring them to let me in — but that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had ordered them not to allow members of Congress to visit these facilities,” Scanlon said in a video posted to X.

Neither ICE nor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to a request for comment.

Members of Congress are legally allowed to conduct unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities. The Moshannon Valley Processing Center is the largest in the region. Officials also denied U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, D-Allegheny County, access to the compound Monday.

Scanlon told WHYY News that she’s received complaints about the facility from her constituents. She said she plans to join Democratic lawmakers suing the Trump administration over similar entrance denials.

“There’s a lot of concerns that arise when you have the government incarcerating people and hiding what’s going on behind those walls — and that’s the purpose for doing oversight,” Scanlon said.

While President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, DHS has asserted that members of Congress must provide advanced notice to be granted entry for tours.

Scanlon said there’s a lot at stake in regards to Trump’s immigration policies. She pointed to the administration’s history of detaining and deporting people without a criminal record. ICE is receiving $45 billion from Trump’s latest spending bill, and private prison contractors are benefitting, Scanlon said.

“​​They’re spending an estimated $3.4 million a month at Moshannon in taxpayer dollars, and I think people have a right to know what that money’s being spent on,” she said.

In his separate opinion, Justice Gorsuch rebuked the district court (and other district courts) for failing to follow Supreme Court precedent.
She also expressed concern that the government’s rushed cancellation of funding grants would halt life-saving biomedical research.","On August 21, 2025, the United States Supreme Court allowed the federal government to proceed with the cancelation of $783 million in funding grants from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to universities and research institutions. Previously, a federal district court declared the government’s cancellation of the grants, and the NIH guidance documents on which it relied to cancel those grants, to be unlawful and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the government’s application to stay the district court’s rulings pending appeal. A closely divided Supreme Court left in place the district court’s ruling vacating the guidance documents while simultaneously staying the district court’s order that invalidated the government’s move to terminate the funding grants.

The justices issued a complicated series of opinions relating to the court’s order. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority, concluding that the Court’s split opinion was necessary to ensure the government’s claims are channeled to the appropriate venue in the lower courts. Justice Barrett said the government’s claim regarding its ability to cancel the funding grants belonged before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (“CFC”), which handles contract disputes involving the federal government. But Justice Barrett said the challenge to the NIH’s guidance documents was properly before the federal district court. “Two-track litigation,” she wrote, “results from the jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the United States, which often requires plaintiffs to file two actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in connection with one set of facts.”

The Court also stated in its opinion that the government must be allowed to cancel the funding grants because the funds may not be recoverable after the recipients expended them. The Court reasoned that “the plaintiffs’ contention that they lack the resources to continue their research projects without federal funding is inconsistent with the proposition that they have the resources to make the Government whole for money already spent.”

Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh agreed with Justice Barrett to the extent the Court vacated the district court’s order terminating the NIH funding grants, but they would have also stayed the portion of the district court’s order that declared the NIH’s guidance documents unlawful.

In his separate opinion, Justice Gorsuch rebuked the district court (and other district courts) for failing to follow Supreme Court precedent. Justice Gorsuch wrote that “[l]ower court judges may sometimes disagree with this Court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them.”

Chief Justice Roberts did not agree that the district court was required to split the case into two parts. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson agreed that the plaintiffs were not required to proceed before separate courts.

Justice Jackson, in a sharply worded opinion, criticized the Court for “sending [the] plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.” She did not agree that the Court’s precedents required allowing the government to terminate the funding grants. She also expressed concern that the government’s rushed cancellation of funding grants would halt life-saving biomedical research.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 21:56:54.232517

Migrants and refugees deserve the same access to justice and protection under the law as anyone else in this country.","Human rights organisations have condemned the Government’s Home Affairs legislation tabled in Parliament this week, as yet another baseless attack on the rights of migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum.

In a move the organisations say shows blatant disregard for the law, the Albanese Government has introduced legislation that would strip migrants and refugees of their legal rights when sending them to third countries like Nauru, legislating their way out of cases currently before the courts.

The Bill is yet another attempt at rushed law-making, this time stripping protections from migrants and refugees that make sure bungled bureaucratic decisions that affect people’s safety and family integrity can be challenged. It is designed to limit government accountability for making sure those decisions are fair and based in fact.

The Bill also has a retrospective effect – validating incorrect decisions that were made in the past, preventing the right for these decisions to be corrected. The Bill even allows the government to continue to prosecute criminal charges that were brought as a result of incorrect decisions.

Jana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“The decisions are serious and lifelong. We are talking about people being permanently deported to places like Nauru. Decisions like this must not be made without fundamental legal safeguards. This legislation is clearly designed to manipulate the law so that the Government is not accountable to the courts.”

“If the idea of people being deported without the ability or right to challenge the decision makes you think of ICE and Donald Trump – you’d be right. The Albanese government is setting a dangerous precedent of removing people’s legal rights to question when the government has made serious mistakes.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director and Principal Solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said:

“All people are entitled to have such serious legal decisions made about them using the correct facts and law, to have an opportunity to respond, and to be protected from unilateral and unjustified changes to that law by the Government after the fact. These decisions are often life and death. They must be correctly and fairly made, and the Government must not be given power to override the protections of the law in this way.”

“The Courts have already recognised one man was not afforded due process prior to an attempt to forcibly exile him to Nauru. The Government now seeks power to override fair processes – and even the established law – in order to facilitate their powers to remove people, including to harm. It’s dangerous law-making to erode these fundamental protections, that are for all members of the Australian community. It’s a disturbing precedent that attacks the core of our fundamental rights.”

Josephine Langbien, Associate Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Just weeks ago, the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee agreed there are serious questions that the Australian Government must answer about its Nauru deportation plans, and the consequences for the people subjected to them. Yet now the Albanese Government wants to permanently exile people to Nauru without having to consider the consequences. This legislation would save the Government from having to consider basic questions like whether someone can access the medical care they need in Nauru, or whether they would be permanently separated from their families. By eliminating safeguards that are designed to ensure fairness and accuracy, the Government is showing that it does not care if it gets these life-changing decisions wrong.”

The group of human rights organisations say this Bill is a blatant attempt at removing scrutiny, stripping people of rights, and shielding the Government from accountability. Migrants and refugees deserve the same access to justice and protection under the law as anyone else in this country. They call on Parliament to reject this dangerous legislation in its entirety.

The lawsuit seeks a $1 million damage claim from the Trump administration, alleging that the student, who is disabled, was waiting for his sister in front of Arleta High School when the “conduct of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents caused the false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, [and] battery” of the boy on Aug. 11, the Los Angeles Times reported.

“Allegations that Border Patrol targeted Arleta High School are FALSE,” said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in response to the lawsuit. “Agents were conducting a targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien.”

Andreina Mejia, the student’s mother, said during a Tuesday news conference that at least two masked men with guns approached her and her son from a white truck, separated the two, placed him in handcuffs, and pulled weapons on him.

“I looked at my son’s reaction, and I saw that he was scared,” Mejia said. “He didn’t know what was going on, so I just told him: ‘Don’t make any movement. Don’t move. Just follow instructions.’”

Mejia’s son receives special services for difficulty processing language and expressing himself, she said, and could be at greater risk of being targeted by ICE agents.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claimed that immigration agents had later arrested an undocumented immigrant and suspected ‘MS-13 member’ found to be the boy’s cousin. On Tuesday, attorneys for the Mejia family said the man arrested was not a member of their family and was of a different nationality altogether.

“There’s no resemblance, except for the brown color,” said attorney Michael Carrillo. “That’s why they were confused, thinking that this — her boy — was the gang member when there was never a case.”

Why It Matters

The arrest comes as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration arrests in a bid to deport millions of undocumented immigrants as part of a hard-line deportation operation. Critics says the government has not been abiding by due process rights for immigrants.

What To Know

Obed Elias Gonzalez-Morales, 36, a long-time U.S. resident with children who are U.S. citizens, was arrested on August 10, 2025, while fishing with his family on the Hooper Islands, Maryland, according to his attorney.

Law enforcement reportedly ran his license plate, identified an immigration issue, and detained him as he returned to his vehicle, the family said.

""I didn't even get to ask what crime I had supposedly committed. They just took me away,"" Gonzalez-Morales told Newsweek in an exclusive interview.

""My family was there—my kids. When they saw that, they were shocked and traumatized. They had never seen me like that before. They handcuffed me and took me away right in front of them,"" he said.

Gonzalez-Morales was transferred to Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi. On August 15, Judge Thanos Kanellakos of the Hyattsville Immigration Court approved a $15,000 bond, allowing him to be released. His family had been preparing to post the bond on Monday morning.

Instead, Gonzalez-Morales was removed from his cell late Saturday and sent to Guatemala overnight.

""We got a call on Sunday from Mr. Obed that he was in Guatemala,"" family attorney Tilman Dunbar Jr. told Newsweek.

""He was taken from his cell late Saturday night and put on a plane to Guatemala sometime Sunday morning,"" he added.

""Obed Gonzalez-Morales, an illegal alien from Guatemala, was issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge on August 9, 2025. He never posted bond and remained in ICE custody until he was removed to his home country, Guatemala, on August 17, 2025,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Newsweek.

A judge-approved bond typically allows detainees to be released pending further hearings.

Gillett said that Gonzalez-Morales was never served with a Notice to Appear or scheduled for a Master Calendar hearing. He added that Gonzalez-Morales has ""strong ties"" to the U.S., including U.S. citizen children, has lived in the country since 2012, and would have sought relief through a Section 42B Application for Cancellation of Removal.

Section 42B allows certain long-term U.S. residents to seek cancellation of removal if they meet specific criteria, including demonstrating strong family and community ties.

Gonzalez-Morales's attorney said he would have been eligible under immigration law.

""The president is doing a lot of harm, separating families. My children are traumatized. They still don't understand why I'm here in my country and not with them. I've always tried to be a good father,"" Gonzalez-Morales said.

He has five children in total, three born in Guatemala and two born in the United States.

What People Are Saying

Chris Yonushonis, a family friend and retired combat veteran, told Newsweek he was ""livid"" following Gonzalez-Morales's removal from the county.

Yonushonis also accused the DHS of violating court orders.

""ICE ignored the orders of a federal judge. We have laws. They apply to the government, too,"" Yonushonis told Newsweek.

We validate the idea that deportation is a fair consequence in the criminal legal system.","Capitol Weekly welcomes Opinions on California public policy or politics. Click here for more information about submitting an Op-Ed.

OPINION – Since January, ICE agents have arrested at least 22 people at California state courthouses in Fresno – with no regard for due process or dignity. These individuals were not fugitives. Some were awaiting trial and had not been convicted of any crime.

All of them were exercising their right to appear in court.

These raids sabotage the integrity of our courts and undermine our democracy. People miss hearings, delay trials, or plead to charges they would otherwise fight, just to avoid an encounter with ICE and deportation without due process. This shuts down access to courts for an entire class of people. Having access to a judicial system is an integral part of a working democracy. Thus, for many in our community a fundamental pillar of democracy has been removed.

California has tried to resist this intrusion. Our state’s laws and courts have repeatedly said that local law enforcement and courts must not cooperate with immigration enforcement. But ICE has proven willing to bypass those guardrails with brute force. Local law enforcement has turned a blind eye to ICE intrusions.

ICE agents in state courts are an affront to the rule of law. Beyond threatening safety and trust, these raids highlight a deeper moral failure in how our immigration system—and too often, our public discourse—treats people with past criminal convictions.

Even among those who condemn ICE’s presence in state courts, it’s become common to distinguish between “good” immigrants and “bad” ones. Immigrants with no criminal record are seen as deserving of protection, while those with prior convictions are cast aside – as though any contact with the criminal legal system forever forfeits a person’s humanity or right to remain.

Such a belief is to ignore how the war on drugs and the continuing scourge of mass incarceration has created a legal system that is deeply flawed. Communities of color, including immigrant communities, are disproportionately targeted, surveilled, arrested, and prosecuted for crimes that white people commit at similar or higher rates. From widespread stop-and-frisks to massive over policing, the U.S. legal system has created criminal records for generations of people of color, particularly in low-income communities.

To then turn around and say those records justify permanent banishment from the country only deepens the harm.

Consider this: many of the people being picked up by ICE throughout the state because of their contact with the criminal legal system are longtime residents with deep ties to their families and communities. Many of their convictions are years, even decades, old. And many of those convictions are not grounds for removal under federal immigration law. But ICE doesn’t care. Their tactics are aggressive, their targets broad, and their discretion virtually unchecked.

If we continue to draw a line between “innocent” immigrants and “criminal” ones, we cede ground to a system that was never just to begin with. We validate the idea that deportation is a fair consequence in the criminal legal system. We ignore the racial and economic disparities that drive that system. And we forget that redemption, rehabilitation, and belonging are core American values.

The answer is recognizing that every immigrant, every person in our society, deserves due process, dignity, and the opportunity to stay rooted in their community.

When we accept deportation as a natural extension of a criminal conviction, we are punishing entire communities, turning courtrooms into trapdoors, and undermining the very idea of justice.

Public defenders, immigrant rights organizations, and community members have been sounding the alarm for years: ICE’s presence in our courts is a threat to public safety and the very foundation of equal justice. It’s time we listen—and act—not only to stop these raids, but to challenge the false hierarchy of human worth they represent.

Newsweek reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security via email for comment.

Why It Matters

Levit's case spotlights the Trump administration's broader illegal immigration crackdown, which includes apprehending non-violent individuals who lack the proper credentials to remain in the United States.

His family claims he was never provided with green card interviews for the majority of the last decade.

In February, a lawsuit was filed against ICE representing 276 immigrants from ex-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and Kazakhstan, who claimed that they were detained and locked up for extended periods of time, violating federal law and internal policies, according to the Louisiana Illuminator.

In June, ICE reported its arrest of a 39-year-old, Tajikistan-born Russian national in Philadelphia who was wanted overseas for being suspected of being a member of the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization.

What To Know

Levit and his Slinger, Wisconsin-based family, which includes his wife and four children (ages 8, 6 and 4-year-old twins), fled Russia over eight years ago to seek asylum in the U.S. due to Levit ""facing persecution for refusing to participate in corrupt practices,"" according to a GoFundMe started by his wife. As of Wednesday morning, $1,650 had been raised of its goal of $5,500.

The husband and father has been detained for over three weeks. Photos show him wearing a hard hat and safety gear as part of his job. The job title was never mentioned.

""As a dedicated public servant, he always upheld the values of honesty and integrity,"" the GoFundMe states. ""However, this commitment came at a devastating cost. Our family was forced to leave behind a life we cherished, filled with love and hope, as threats, searches and even an assassination attempt made it clear that our safety was in jeopardy.

""The fear for our lives pushed us to start anew in a foreign land, without connections and with limited English. We faced countless challenges, losing everything multiple times, yet we persevered.""

The crowdfunding campaign alleges that Levit was taken into custody ""in handcuffs and chains, without explanation"" as he left for work one day. It also alleges that Russian authorities issued an Interpol request for his arrest, seeking to deport him back to a country ""where he would face certain death or imprisonment for his beliefs.""

""The Russian government is relentless in its pursuit of those they deem undesirable, and they have taken away my beloved husband and the father of our four young children,"" says the GoFundMe. ""Throughout our time in the U.S., we had an attorney who was supposed to guide us and represent us, but on that fateful day he abandoned us, leaving us without support when we needed it most.

""We lost all the money we had paid him, and now we find ourselves in desperate need of funds to hire a new attorney.""

They added that ""without legal representation, the odds are stacked against us,"" saying that individuals in his position who lack counsel ""almost always lose.""

The Trump administration is restoring an immigration policy that was last used under former President George H.W. Bush's tenure to conduct neighborhood investigations related to immigrants applying for U.S. naturalization, according to a policy memo released Tuesday by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

""U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is resuming personal investigations of aliens applying for naturalization in accordance with section 335(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" the memo, dated Aug. 22 but released publicly Tuesday, states.

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act abolished immigration quotas and championed welcoming ""those who can contribute most to this country — to its growth, to its strength, to its spirit,"" according to President Lyndon B. Johnson's remarks at the time of him signing the act into law.

The administration's revitalization of personal investigations, also called ""neighborhood checks,"" will include U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services requesting information from immigrants seeking naturalization, such as ""testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, co-workers, and business associates who know the alien and can provide substantiated information about the alien, including any of the requirements for naturalization.""

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is an office under the Department of Homeland Security's umbrella that oversees the nation's legal immigration processing.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO VET LEGAL IMMIGRANT APPLICANTS FOR 'ANTI-AMERICANISM' AND ANTISEMITISM

The memorandum stated that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ""generally waives the requirements for neighborhood investigations"" under the 1965 law and historically had relied instead on FBI background checks to determine an ""applicant’s good moral character and eligibility for naturalization.""

The personal investigations will now include interviewing a naturalization applicant's neighbors and employment history stretching back at least five years before an individual applied for naturalization, according to the memo. The checks are to ensure ""scrutiny of an alien’s residency, good moral character, attachment to the U.S. Constitution, and disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

TRUMP ADMIN TO WEIGH US CITIZENSHIP APPLICANTS' 'POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS,' GOOD MORAL CHARACTER

Such investigations were last conducted in 1991 during the first Bush's tenure, according to the memo. Similar investigations were carried out on immigrants applying for naturalization as far back as 1802, the memo added.

""From 1802 to 1981, petitioners for naturalization were required to present two witnesses who could testify to their qualifications for citizenship,"" the memo stated. ""In 1981, Congress eliminated the requirement for witnesses, a change justified in part by the fact that a petitioner’s character could be better determined by an investigation, including a neighborhood investigation, if necessary.

""However, by 1991, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service had essentially stopped conducting neighborhood investigations.""

TOP DHS OFFICIAL CALLS CITIZENSHIP TEST 'TOO SOFT,' URGES MAJOR OVERHAUL OF NATURALIZATION PROCESS

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services celebrated the return of the personal investigations.

Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in comments provided to Fox News Digital Wednesday that the office ""is working to ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship.""

""The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations, and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent,"" he continued. ""Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously its responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

State election officials were invited to the White House last month where CIS officials pitched them on an untested solution for a nearly nonexistent problem.","The Trump administration is asking select states to help “soft launch” the latest new feature of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) revamped citizenship verification program.

The invitation, which came in an email sent last week by DHS to North Carolina’s GOP-controlled election board, appears to signal the administration’s latest step to encourage states to use data managed by the federal government to hunt for noncitizens on the rolls.

In the August 21 email, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) official invited North Carolina to participate in the limited rollout, which the official called “an exciting opportunity.”

The email was sent to the North Carolina board’s associate general counsel and posted online as part of the agenda for a Wednesday board meeting.

“This soft launch is by invitation only—we are not announcing its availably [sic] for widespread use at this time,” wrote the USCIS official, Timothy Benz. “SAVE needs to throttle the intake of these cases at the outset, as we know the demand will be high and want to ensure the system’s ability to meet the increased demand. We are prioritizing your state due to prior participation and engagements between our agencies.”

At Wednesday’s regularly-scheduled public meeting, the North Carolina State Board of Elections tabled discussion of participating in the DHS soft launch after returning from a lengthy closed session.

After returning to public session and voting on other matters, board chair Francis X. De Luca (R) said the board would “skip” the SAVE agenda item.

“We are going to put that off for another day. We’re not dealing with that issue,” De Luca said. “We discussed some of the [legal] details in closed session and decided that we weren’t ready to deal with that issue.”

The email requested North Carolina upload their citizenship confirmation request to SAVE on Wednesday, and provide in advance the number of registrations the Board would upload in bulk for verification.

By tabling the matter, the Board effectively declined the offer to test the system’s new capabilities, although the email did say rescheduling may be possible.

President Donald Trump ordered DHS in March to make the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program available for free to state election officials for confirming the citizenship status of registered voters. SAVE uses various federal databases to flag whether someone is a non-citizen, and was originally developed to check eligibility for federal benefits programs through one-by-one queries.

Since the order, CIS integrated data from the Social Security Administration and added the ability to perform citizenship checks in bulk. The latest upgrade allows election officials to use just the last four digits of a social security number — rather than requiring all nine — along with the individual’s name and date of birth when submitting a citizenship check request.

Under the federal Help Americans Vote Act, when someone registers to vote, state election officers must ask for either their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number. Allowing election officials to use SAVE with just the last four social security number digits, rather than all nine, would let them rely on readily available data to use SAVE.

State election officials were invited to the White House last month where CIS officials pitched them on an untested solution for a nearly nonexistent problem. Before that, the administration provided a briefing on using SAVE to the Election Integrity Network, a far-right anti-voting group founded by lawyer Cleta Mitchell.

Using SAVE for purging voter registration rolls has led voting-rights groups and Democratic officials to question whether DHS has complied with federal data laws, which generally require federal agencies to give public notice before using personal data in novel ways.

The expansion also comes amid renewed concerns about the Trump administration’s cybersecurity lapses. The Department of Government Efficiency uploaded a database with every American’s name, date of birth and social security number to an unsecured cloud server in June, according to a recent whistleblowing complaint filed by the Social Security Administration’s chief data officer.

According to CIS records, twenty states, as well as a few dozen local election offices, are currently registered to use the SAVE program for voter roll maintenance.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration’s attempt to work with North Carolina’s elections board comes as no surprise.

After the GOP lost the North Carolina gubernatorial race in 2024, the Republican-dominated legislature transferred the power to appoint members of the elections board from the Democratic governor to the Republican state auditor. That maneuver led to Republicans controlling three of the Board’s five seats.

The Republicans on the board quickly ousted its longtime executive director, a respected nonpartisan election administrator, and replaced her with Sam Hayes, a GOP operative who was serving as chief counsel to the House Speaker.

Under Hayes, the board coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in response to a lawsuit filed by the DOJ aiming to require the state to tighten its rules on what identifying information votes must provide.

The bottom line: What the Trump administration calls a takeover, Bowser is framing as an investment in D.C.'s future.","D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday said ""masked ICE agents"" have ""not worked"" and called National Guard troops sent from other states inefficient under President Trump's federal takeover.

The big picture: Despite the critique, Bowser's 20-day review of the crackdown was overwhelmingly positive — a significant tone shift for the mayor, who suggested she and Trump are on the same page when it comes to ""priorities around safety and investment in infrastructure.""

Driving the news: Bowser pledged support for Trump's $2 billion request to Congress to ""beautify"" D.C. parks, fountains, streets and more.

She also praised what she calls the ""federal surge"" for reducing crime in D.C. Bowser said having more federal law enforcement on city streets has helped tamp down on illegal guns, carjackings, and homicides.

""We think that there's more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior,"" Bowser said at the Wednesday press conference.

By the numbers: There's been an 87% drop in D.C. carjackings over the 20-day period compared to the same time last year, per the mayor.

D.C.'s data also shows a 15% decline in overall crime from the same period in 2024.

Yes, but: While the mayor painted a Trumpian gold lining on much of the enforcement, she specifically targeted masked ICE agents and out-of-town National Guards members as examples of ""what's not working.""

She also called out ""a break in trust between police and community,"" as federal officers team up with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

What they're saying: ""I am devastated by people living in fear,"" Bowser said, acknowledging that ""there's tremendous anxiety in the District.""

Between the lines: D.C.'s sanctuary city status has come under question, amid a spike in noncriminal ICE arrests and MPD's cooperation with immigration authorities.

Bowser clarified: ""There's been no change to the law,"" nor ""sanctuary values.""

Bowser also noted D.C.'s small but ""highly visible"" homeless encampment population, which has been targeted in clearings under the federal takeover.

She plans to take a census later this week to quantify and locate homeless individuals, and connect people to shelters and services.

Zoom out: Bowser, who had previously called federalizing D.C.'s police force an ""authoritarian push,"" was notably deferential toward Trump days after he issued a warning shot from the Oval Office:

""Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run,"" the president said Friday.

Bowser held Wednesday's press conference after speaking with Trump, a meeting she compared to one during his first days in office, ""where we discussed shared priorities for the District.""

Bowser noted that Trump's ""knowledge of D.C. had significantly increased from the first time he was in the White House.""

What we're watching: Bowser highlighted more long-term solutions for effective local control: more MPD, prosecutors, judges, and effective prevention programs.

A big priority: recruiting 500 new MPD officers over the next few years.

The bottom line: What the Trump administration calls a takeover, Bowser is framing as an investment in D.C.'s future.

Take Union Station. On Wednesday, the Department of Transportation took control of its management.

Bowser said a ""total transformation"" of the station would be an ""amazing initiative,"" and told Trump it could be ""a very significant and good investment for this region.""

In its holding, the Seventh Circuit emphasizes “flexibility” because “a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to notice” even if a “material dispute” exists.
Other circuit courts have departed from Lusardi and established their own approaches.
The Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either approach in Richards.
Consequently, the Seventh Circuit’s decision marks a shift in how collective actions are evaluated, and it offers a better opportunity for employers to challenge whether a proposed collective is truly similarly situated.","In a recent decision, the Seventh Circuit favorably revised the standard for defendant employers faced with a putative collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). In Richards v. Eli Lilly & Co., the court departed from the widely-adopted lenient standard used to analyze a plaintiff’s request to send notice to putative collective action members set forth in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. The Seventh Circuit, which governs district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, has instead adopted a balanced approach that requires district courts to consider evidence from both sides with respect to similarity and allows them to issue notice to potential plaintiffs only when there is “at least a material factual dispute” of whether individuals are indeed similarly situated.

The Basics

Section 216(b) of the FLSA allows employees to bring wage actions against their employer on behalf of themselves or other “similarly situated” employees, and the ADEA incorporates this provision to allow employees to form collective actions when suing an employer for age discrimination. However, without a national standard from Congress or the Supreme Court, district courts have been left to decide how and when to permit notice to go out to other potential plaintiffs. This vacuum gave rise to the two-step approach from Lusardi.

In Lusardi, a 1987 decision from the District Court in New Jersey, the court split the collective action into two steps. The first step requires a plaintiff seeking to send notice to make a “modest factual showing” that they and the potential plaintiffs were subject to the same unlawful plan or policy by their employer. Once a plaintiff has met this low burden, the court then authorized notice to those individuals, who could then opt into the collective action. The second step occurs once discovery is complete, when the employer typically challenges whether the collective is indeed similarly situated by moving to decertify the collective action.

The New Seventh Circuit Approach

In declining to follow Lusardi, the Seventh Circuit held that a plaintiff must at least show that a “material factual dispute” exists as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. This is viewed as a higher evidentiary burden on the named plaintiffs, who must demonstrate that they and the proposed collective were subject to the same unlawful plan or policy. Additionally (and crucially), district courts must now permit defendants to submit evidence rebutting a plaintiff’s claim that a collective is appropriate. By doing so, courts will evaluate the extent to which plaintiffs engage with and respond to opposing evidence.

This differs from the Lusardi standard in two ways. First, plaintiffs must now cross a higher evidentiary threshold to justify issuing notice to a potential collective. Second, courts will consider evidence by both parties—not just a “modest” showing by the plaintiff—before deciding whether notice is appropriate.

In its holding, the Seventh Circuit emphasizes “flexibility” because “a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to notice” even if a “material dispute” exists. District courts may still use the two-step approach and issue notice to the proposed collective if they believes that necessary evidence is in the hands of potential plaintiffs. Alternatively, if a court believes that a similarity dispute can be resolved before authorizing notice, it may allow limited discovery to decide whether or not notice is appropriate.

Other circuit courts have departed from Lusardi and established their own approaches. For example, the Fifth Circuit demands plaintiffs prove by a “preponderance of the evidence” that the individuals are similarly situated before the court permits notice to issue. This means the plaintiff bears the burden from the outset of a case to definitively prove that certification is warranted. The Sixth Circuit, on the other hand, requires a “strong likelihood” that the potential plaintiffs are similarly situated, and a court may expedite discovery to decide whether notice is appropriate. The Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either approach in Richards. With a range of approaches emerging, this could set the stage for resolution by the Supreme Court.

Conclusion

Before Richards, defendants were left with very few options, while plaintiffs were permitted to form potentially oversized collectives that may have included both eligible and ineligible plaintiffs. As the Seventh Circuit admitted, this meant defendants were susceptible to higher discovery costs, premature settlements, and an influx of potential claimants who may choose to bring their own individual lawsuits.

Consequently, the Seventh Circuit’s decision marks a shift in how collective actions are evaluated, and it offers a better opportunity for employers to challenge whether a proposed collective is truly similarly situated. Employers who respond strategically could see reduced litigation and/or settlement costs and increase the odds of defeating the certification of a collective action. Affected Employers should reach out to their employment counsel with any questions or explore this development further.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15069_1440.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 18:57:56.249320

In turn, foreign students have taken advantage of U.S. generosity and have become “forever” students, perpetually enrolled in higher education courses to remain in the U.S.
Under President Trump’s proposed rule, the federal government would set the authorized admission and extension periods for foreign students and exchange visitors up to the duration of the program they are participating in, not to exceed a 4-year period.
The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days.
This proposed rule was first proposed under President Trump in 2020 but was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in 2021 much to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers.","New rule will limit the amount of time that foreign students, professors, physicians, and other visa holders are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting

WASHINGTON, DC – Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a proposed rule that, if finalized, would limit the length of time certain visa holders – including foreign students– are allowed to stay in the United States, thereby curbing visa abuse and increasing the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to properly vet and oversee these individuals.

“For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the U.S. virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars, and disadvantaging U.S. citizens,” said a DHS spokesperson. “This new proposed rule would end that abuse once and for all by limiting the amount of time certain visa holders are allowed to remain in the U.S., easing the burden on the federal government to properly oversee foreign students and their history.”

Since 1978, foreign students (F visa holders) have been admitted into the U.S. for an unspecified period known as “duration of status.” Unlike other visas issued, those with a “duration of status” designation are allowed to remain in the U.S. for an indefinite amount of time without further screening and vetting.

In turn, foreign students have taken advantage of U.S. generosity and have become “forever” students, perpetually enrolled in higher education courses to remain in the U.S.

Under President Trump’s proposed rule, the federal government would set the authorized admission and extension periods for foreign students and exchange visitors up to the duration of the program they are participating in, not to exceed a 4-year period. The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days. Foreign media representatives would be eligible for an extension period of up to 240 days, but no longer than the length of the temporary activity or assignment.

Additionally, admitting foreign students, exchange, and foreign media classifications for a fixed period of time would require said aliens to for apply for authorization to extend their stay with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS for the alien to remain in the U.S. for a longer period.

This would allow DHS to conduct proper oversight as part of SEVP and SEVIS by making access to necessary information more accessible and reducing the number of individuals here on visas.

This proposed rule was first proposed under President Trump in 2020 but was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in 2021 much to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers.

Marshals and can hold up to 1,064 people overall — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day.
At its peak this fiscal year, the center had exceeded its ICE capacity by more than 200 at 462, making it among the 10 most-overcrowded immigration facilities out of the nation's 180 ICE detention centers, according to TRAC.
“This increase in law enforcement personnel will obviously raise the level of individuals arrested and the requirement for detention capacity.” CoreCivic already entered a new contract in February to increase capacity at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.
Local officials, however, said the cost of holding ICE detainees was too much for the county to bear.","As President Donald Trump ramps up immigration enforcement efforts and arrests multiply statewide, Nevada's main immigration detention center has become one of the most over-capacity immigration facilities in the nation.

As of April 2025, the Nevada Southern Detention Center, located in Pahrump, exceeded its contractual capacity with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by more than 40 people per day, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). The facility — which houses a mix of detainees from ICE, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals and can hold up to 1,064 people overall — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day.

At its peak this fiscal year, the center had exceeded its ICE capacity by more than 200 at 462, making it among the 10 most-overcrowded immigration facilities out of the nation's 180 ICE detention centers, according to TRAC.

Contractual capacity measures the number of detainees a private prison agrees to hold — so it doesn’t necessarily mean an entire building is physically crowded. ICE also doesn’t release capacity figures in real time, so TRACs data lags behind current conditions. And TRAC’s latest measure showed that across all facilities nationwide, ICE is only using about 76 percent of its contractual capacity.

But the situation in Nevada could be part of the rationale for creating more detention facilities in the state.

The findings were released a few weeks before The Washington Post revealed that ICE was eyeing creating a new facility in Nevada, called a “soft-side” facility, which is a makeshift structure composed of tents. Such a facility would double detention capacity in Nevada, adding space for an additional 450 people, per documents obtained by The Washington Post that The Nevada Independent has not been able to independently verify.

Arrests, detention spending on the rise

Officials from CoreCivic, the private company that oversees the Nevada Southern Detention Center, have said that ballooning immigration arrests have increased demand for detention space. They said they expect demand to increase even more with the passage of Trump’s budget bill, which pumps more than $45 billion into expanding detention capacity nationwide and $29.9 billion towards the agencies’ enforcement operations through 2029.

Already in the first six months of Trump’s term, immigration arrests in Nevada have jumped nearly 300 percent compared with the same time period in 2024. Seventy percent of those people had not committed a violent or sex crime.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill has changed dramatically the activity of ICE and securing bed capacity,” Damon T. Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic, said during an Aug. 11 earnings call. “This increase in law enforcement personnel will obviously raise the level of individuals arrested and the requirement for detention capacity.”

CoreCivic already entered a new contract in February to increase capacity at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.

In a recent earnings report from CoreCivic, company officials said they had several “soft-side” contracts in the works, although they did not provide details about where and when the contracts would take effect.

“We are in various stages of negotiation on multiple idled facilities to provide additional bed capacity to ICE,” Hininger said during the August earnings call.

The number of ICE detainees at the Nevada Southern Detention Center marks a dramatic increase from the number of people detained during former President Joe Biden’s administration. At the end of 2023, 163 people were detained at the facility, according to an ICE end-of-year report.

The other facilities to most exceed daily detention capacity are the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, the Clay County Justice Center in Indiana, and Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota.

CoreCivic referred The Indy to ICE for additional information on any contracts and said in a statement that it stays ""in regular contact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and all our government partners to understand their changing needs, and we work within their established procurement processes.”

ICE responded “acknowledging receipt of your query. Thank you.""

Elected officials raise questions

Officials have recently raised concerns about access to resources at the detention center. Last week, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) put out a statement calling for increased oversight of the facility after being denied a visit, and the Latino Legislative Caucus, which visited earlier this summer, raised concerns about access to legal services. Last year, more than 30 reports of medical negligence, racial discrimination and verbal assault prompted a federal investigation into the facility.

“I spoke with nine detainees today, and what they shared with me is deeply concerning,” Horsford said in a statement. “Medical treatment can take weeks; detainees do not have reliable access to immigration attorneys or resources; and many have been moved across state lines in the dead of night without advanced notice or understanding of where they were going.”

Discussion of a new facility comes as local jails have struggled to keep up with the fiscal demands of supporting ICE operations. In November, the Nye County Detention Center in Pahrump terminated a contract in place from 2019 to house ICE inmates alongside the county’s other inmates. Before the contract ended, it was the state’s second largest ICE holding facility. Local officials, however, said the cost of holding ICE detainees was too much for the county to bear.

“I don’t think it's to anyone’s advantage except ICE,” former Republican Commissioner Donna Cox said about the contract during a county meeting.

The Henderson Detention Center, which also holds a mix of local detainees and people arrested by ICE, has only seen a slight uptick in people detained by the agency. At the end of fiscal year 2023, 69 people were held there on behalf of ICE, in comparison to the 76 people held by the fiscal year 2025 to date, according to ICE data.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/07/fcc17134-nllc-ice-visit-1-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 20:57:04.789171

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has denied the allegations.
If Abrego Garcia is sent by passenger jet, it would be unusual if he were the only deportee on the flight, he says.
More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated following detention in the same Salvadoran prison that housed Abrego Garcia.
It's unclear what would happen to Abrego Garcia once in Uganda, says Nelson Kasfir, an emeritus professor of government at Dartmouth who studies Africa.","The Trump administration says it intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia — the man who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador in March before being returned to the U.S. — to Uganda, a country with which he has no connection, in what experts describe as a costly, complex and legally questionable move.

A federal judge in Maryland has set a next hearing for Oct. 6 and blocked his deportation before then. In the meantime, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said Wednesday that he wants to seek asylum in the U.S. as part of a new claim based on a fear of persecution.

In a statement on Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem justified the administration's targeting of Abrego Garcia by repeating allegations against him. ""President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator, to terrorize American citizens any longer,"" Noem said.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has denied the allegations. He has not been convicted of any crimes and has not been formally charged with being a gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has a family in Maryland, returned to the U.S. in June, after spending several weeks in El Salvador's notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo prison — known as CECOT. He was then immediately detained, after being indicted on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Last week, he was released from pretrial detention but then was re-arrested by ICE agents on Monday in Baltimore.

U.S. officials said they would send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty and served any sentence in the U.S., but he declined the offer.

For now, he's being held at a detention center in Virginia. But his ultimate fate remains unclear.

If the courts ultimately approve his removal, here is the process by which that might occur.

An escorted flight

Abrego Garcia would likely be placed on a chartered passenger plane or military transport, accompanied by ICE agents who are part of the agency's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) unit, according to César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the Ohio State University who studies immigration.

""He would be physically shackled — most likely at the ankles, sometimes also handcuffed — for the entire length of the flight, which could be many, many hours,"" García Hernández says.

If Abrego Garcia is sent by passenger jet, it would be unusual if he were the only deportee on the flight, he says. ""Most of the aircraft ICE uses are large passenger aircraft — Boeing 737s — and that's why we typically do not see ICE deport one person at a time. These flights are simply too expensive.""

Jacqueline Stevens, a political science professor at Northwestern University, says that when people were deported to South Sudan, some were flown as far as Djibouti on a private jet, and then from Djibouti to South Sudan on a military plane. (However, those flights also faced legal challenges and may not be indicative of what happens on future flights.)

She says the optics of sending Abrego Garcia on his own wouldn't be good, especially for an administration that has billed itself as using taxpayer money wisely. ""That's not going to be a good look"" for ICE, she says.

Earlier this year, immigration officials admitted that deporting Abrego Garicia to El Salvador was due to an ""administrative error."" It occurred in violation of an immigration judge ruling in 2019 that he was deportable, but not back to El Salvador, where he had a ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution.

Uganda's foreign ministry said last week that it reached a ""temporary"" agreement with the U.S. to accept deportees, saying it was meant for people ""who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.""

It said as a condition of the agreement, ""individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted."" It also said that Uganda ""prefers"" to take individuals from other African countries.

NPR reached out to the Ugandan embassy and the Department of Homeland Security for specific information about how Abrego Garcia's removal and transfer might occur. Ugandan officials did not immediately reply. DHS referred back to Noem's original statement without providing details.

Although Abrego Garcia's case is still being adjudicated, he wouldn't be the first migrant to be deported to a third country in recent months. In July, the U.S. removed five migrants to Eswatini, a landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa formerly known as Swaziland. That same month, eight men were sent to South Sudan, only one of whom was from there. More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated following detention in the same Salvadoran prison that housed Abrego Garcia.

Anwen Hughes, director of legal strategy for refugee programs at Human Rights First, says that it isn't illegal for the U.S. to try to deport a person to a third country, but the law ""requires them to run through a hierarchy of countries before deciding to send, for example, a Vietnamese person to South Sudan,"" she says. ""They do not seem to be operating that way.""

Hughes is part of a legal team that filed a motion for a class certification and a temporary restraining order in March challenging ICE's policy on removing individuals to third countries without notice.

""It's highly unusual for the United States to deport someone to a country to which they have no ties,"" says García Hernández. ""Almost always, deportations are to a person's country of citizenship or prior residence.""

Handover upon landing in Uganda

Once the plane carrying Abrego Garcia and his ICE escorts lands in Uganda, the agents will likely hand over paperwork attesting to his identity, criminal history and medical records, according to García Hernández. ""At that point, the U.S. is essentially done.""

From there, it would be up to Uganda to decide what to do, he says.

""Any claims of criminal activity are fair game for Ugandan officials,"" he says, adding that ""it's a tough sell for a foreign government to welcome into their community someone the U.S. president and his Cabinet have repeatedly described as horrifically dangerous,"" despite Abrego Garcia's lack of criminal record.

It's unclear what would happen to Abrego Garcia once in Uganda, says Nelson Kasfir, an emeritus professor of government at Dartmouth who studies Africa. ""I do not think they would detain or harm him,"" Kasfir says. ""I also doubt they would promptly re-deport him, but that's harder to say.""

Kristof Titeca, a professor at Antwerp University in Belgium who studies African governance, notes that it's not the first time Uganda has hosted ""failed asylum seekers"" from other countries. In 2018, for example, it hosted Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers deported from Israel. In that instance, they were allowed to stay in a Kampala hotel for a few nights, ""then left to their own devices,"" he says. ""Contrary to what they were promised, they also didn't get a residence permit. Many of them decided to flee to Europe.""

Opposition figures in Uganda pushed back on the scheme, saying parliament in the largely authoritarian country had not been given a say in the agreement with the U.S. Details remain largely unknown about the deal brokered between President Yoweri Museveni — who is seeking to extend his nearly 40-year rule in next year's elections — and the U.S.

""We don't know the exact arrangement, the circumstances, who is being brought, how many are being brought,"" Joel Ssenyonyi, the leader of opposition in parliament, told NPR. ""If these are being considered misfits in the U.S., what makes them fit to be here in Uganda?""

García Hernández thinks that by sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda, ""the Trump administration is trying to circumnavigate an immigration judge's order barring deportation to El Salvador by triangulating — sending him to Uganda first.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, tells NPR that Uganda has given no assurances that his client can stay in that country and ""not be quickly re-deported to his country of citizenship.""

As the administration aggressively pursues its immigration enforcement agenda, it is creating a crisis in the nation’s education system—one that’s leaving thousands of children behind academically and emotionally.

Short-Term Impact: Absenteeism and Fear in the Classroom

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has significantly increased enforcement through workplace raids, neighborhood sweeps, and community targeting, including near schools and places of worship. Policies that once protected these “sensitive locations” were revoked in January 2025. As a result, the second half of the 2024-2025 school year saw a chilling effect where families were pulling their children out of school, terrified that a parent, family member, or child could be detained or deported as some students and families have been.

When students are too afraid to go to school or are too distracted by the threat of family separation to focus, their education suffers. And these aren’t isolated cases. As of 2023, approximately 5 million children in the U.S. live with at least one undocumented family member. The scale of the impact is national.

Long-Term Consequences: A Threat to the Right to Education

Another insidious threat lies in how Trump-era policies and rhetoric have emboldened some states to go further and challenge the very right of immigrant children to receive an education. This year, lawmakers in states like Oklahoma and Tennessee proposed legislation that would require school districts to report undocumented students, charge them to attend school, or deny enrollment to children without legal immigration status. Neither of these efforts passed, yet other threats persist.

These efforts are a clear attack on the landmark 1982 Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe, which ruled that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to a free public education. If these state efforts were to succeed, hundreds of thousands of children (there were about 1 million undocumented children aged 5-18 in 2023) could be barred from education, creating devastating cycles of poverty, social exclusion, and growing inequality.

Community Resistance and Local Advocacy

In the face of these threats, many states, local school districts, community organizations, and grassroots leaders continue to show up for their students and their families. Across the country, states like Illinois have passed legislation that preserves access to education, regardless of immigration status. School districts like Los Angeles have introduced policies to protect immigrant families. Teachers can also undergo training on how to support undocumented students and respond if enforcement actions occur.

The dedication of local leadership and grassroots mobilization sends a clear message: schools should be safe spaces for learning, not sites of fear and exclusion.

The Role of AI in Surveillance and Deportation

Adding another layer of complexity is the increasing use of artificial intelligence in immigration enforcement. Under contracts with tech companies, ICE has gained access to powerful AI tools that aggregate data from sources such as IRS records, Social Security files, passports, and license-plate readers. These systems often operate without transparency or oversight and can disproportionately impact immigrant communities.

There are growing concerns that AI-driven surveillance could be used to track migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who engage with public services, including school enrollment. AI is already being used to track and revoke the visas of international students across the United States.

Though the full impact of the technology is still being assessed, its usage and reach are expanding rapidly. Without safeguards, these tools risk deepening mistrust in public institutions and further alienating vulnerable families.

Moving Forward: Protecting Every Child’s Right to Learn

Trauma, disrupted schooling, and the erosion of trust in institutions have long-term consequences for both individuals and the broader society. But hope remains in the resilient and compassionate responses from communities across the country, dedicated to keeping schools as safe spaces where everyone can learn.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-learning-classroom-shadows-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:54.409377

Officials in Gaza say that only 14% of essential food items were allowed into the enclave last month. At least 76 Palestinians have also been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since dawn, including 18 people seeking food. This comes as Al Jazeera reports Israeli forces are leveling entire blocks of Gaza City.

The Israeli government is claiming Monday’s deadly strike on Nasser Hospital targeted a camera used by Hamas for surveillance, but Israel provided no evidence to back up the claim. The double-tap strike killed 21 people, including five journalists.

In media news, a Reuters photojournalist has resigned over her outlet’s response to Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza, including Reuters cameraman Hussam al-Masri, who was killed in the Nasser Hospital attack. In a statement, Valerie Zink said, “By repeating Israel’s genocidal fabrications without determining if they have any credibility … Western media outlets have made possible the killing of more journalists in two years on one tiny strip of land than in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine combined.”

Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch is saying that U.S. forces and personnel can be held liable for Israeli war crimes for “providing intelligence for Israeli strikes and conducting extensive coordination and planning.”

In Israel, nationwide protests are continuing. On Tuesday, more than 350,000 people gathered at Tel Aviv’s public plaza calling on the government to accept a ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza. Large protests were also held in Jerusalem. This is Michal Gomel Blank, a protester in Jerusalem.

Michal Gomel Blank: “We are here demonstrating in front of the Cabinet, the government meeting that is supposed to discuss a deal, a deal for returning the hostages and end the fighting and the war. And we are here to remind our government that the deal needs to be sealed. All the hostages need to come back home, and we need to stop the war in order to do this.”

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces are conducting a raid on Nablus. At least 80 Palestinians have been injured. This comes a day after Israeli forces raided Ramallah and al-Bireh. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, 58 people were injured, eight by live fire and 14 by rubber-coated bullets. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that a child had to receive surgery after being hit by live fire. Israeli forces detained three Palestinians in the raid.

Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley visited the West Bank Tuesday and stopped at a Palestinian church in Taybeh that was attacked by Israeli settlers. Senator Van Hollen called for an end to settler violence.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen: “Well, we’re here, overall, because we want to focus on the really terrible situation throughout this area, including the war in Gaza. And one of our messages, we need to end the war in Gaza and bring the hostages home. But we also need to end this continued settler violence on the West Bank, which people here in this town of Taybeh witnessed and experienced firsthand.”

A coalition of 100 human and civil rights groups are calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to secure the release of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American who has been held in Israeli prison for six months. The coalition includes the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Center for Constitutional Rights and Pax Christi USA.

In a joint letter, the groups say, “Mohammed is suffering from scabies and has not received any medication; he has also lost over 30 pounds due to Israel denying him food and medical treatment.” He was abducted from his family home in the West Bank over allegations of rock throwing and is currently being held in Israel’s Ofer Prison, known for its human rights abuses. Mohammed Ibrahim is the cousin of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American who was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July.

A Democratic National Committee panel has rejected a resolution calling for an arms embargo on Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza. The vote came during a DNC meeting in Minneapolis. A second resolution on Israel was initially approved but then withdrawn by its author, DNC Chair Ken Martin. Martin then called for a task force to be formed to help build party unity on the issue. We will speak to the sponsor of the arms embargo resolution later in the program.

A group of current and former Microsoft workers occupied the office of Microsoft’s President Brad Smith on Tuesday to protest Microsoft’s work with the Israeli military in Gaza. The tech workers accused Microsoft of “powering the genocide in Gaza and the mass surveillance of Palestinians.” Seven protesters were arrested. This comes as Bloomberg reports Microsoft has asked the FBI for help tracking pro-Palestinian protests targeting the company.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has asked a federal appeals court to put on hold a judge’s ruling last week that could force the closure of a new immigration jail in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge had ordered the Trump administration to stop transferring immigrants to the jail. Meanwhile, weekly vigils are continuing to be held outside the immigration jail to protest what organizers have described as the inhumane treatment of people detained inside.

On Tuesday, during a three-hour Cabinet meeting, President Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, D.C. He failed to provide any details on the policy, considering the fact that the District of Columbia does not authorize capital punishment.

President Donald Trump: “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital? Capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, D.C., we’re going to be seeking the death penalty.”

During the Cabinet meeting, President Trump also said the U.S. would accept up to 600,000 Chinese students — an announcement that quickly drew backlash from his MAGA base, including from Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer. Trump said he liked having Chinese students in the U.S.

President Donald Trump: “But I like that their students come here. I like that other countries’ students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn’t? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. You’d have — and it wouldn’t be the top colleges. It would be colleges that struggle, on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system.”

The president’s comments are a shift from his administration’s policy. Back in May, the State Department announced that it was vetting Chinese students for connections to the Chinese Communist Party.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook says she will file a lawsuit against President Trump’s attempts to remove her from her post. Cook is the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Trump is claiming, without evidence, that Cook committed mortgage fraud. Cook’s attorney says the president “lacks any factual or legal basis” to fire her. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been pressured by the president to lower interest rates. We’ll have more on this story after headlines.

Lebanese journalists are demanding an apology from Tom Barrack, the U.S. envoy to Syria, for demeaning comments he made at a press conference in Beirut.

Tom Barrack: “The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone. So, you want — you want to know what’s happening? Act civilized, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what’s happening in the region.”

The Union of Journalists in Lebanon called for a boycott of all future events with Barrack unless he apologizes for his comments, saying, “the content of his remarks reflects ingrained colonial arrogance towards the peoples of the region and constitutes a blatant violation of basic diplomatic etiquette and the values that diplomacy should represent — chief among them respect for press freedom and the people’s right to knowledge.”

FEMA is suspending staff members who signed a letter criticizing the Trump administration for gutting the agency’s ability to handle natural disasters. The letter came just days before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. At least 36 employees have signed their full names to the letter, titled the “Katrina Declaration,” and about 150 others have signed the letter anonymously. On Tuesday, FEMA told the staffers that they were put on administrative leave in a “non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits.”

Seated nearby were Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who controls the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has touted the arrest of cartel members in Oregon.

“We are expecting a crackdown,” Chavez-DeRemer added, glancing at the two other officials.

So far, ICE activity has largely focused at the agency’s base in South Portland, where black-clad protesters have appeared on a nightly basis, leading to several clashes.

ICE agents detained four farmworkers during a traffic stop in Marion County earlier this month. Others have been detained immediately after their immigration hearings at the federal courthouse. ICE officials also arrested a 38-year-old chiropractor originally from Iran outside his child’s Montessori school last month.

Bondi memorably crossed swords with U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, in June when Merkley peppered Bondi with questions about Trump’s cryptocurrency and the risk of influence peddling.

The former mayor of Happy Valley, Chavez-DeRemer rose to prominence when she was elected to the U.S. House representing Oregon’s 5th District in 2022.

In response, the Trump administration did what any responsible government would do.
Last month, about 140 employees at the EPA who signed an opposition letter were placed on administrative leave.
It remains to be seen what other actions could come as a result of the FEMA employees' letter.","Reports that the Trump administration placed some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on leave after they signed an open letter of dissent earlier this week has sparked criticism on social media.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter sent to the FEMA Review Council and Congress on Monday, critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warning that FEMA's capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished. Only 36 signed their names, while others withheld their names for fear of retribution.

The Washington Post first reported that by Tuesday evening, some of those employees had received letters informing them that they were being placed on paid administrative leave, effective immediately. About 30 employees were told they were being placed on leave, according to The New York Times.

Stand Up for Science, the advocacy group that helped publicize the letter, told Newsweek that ""many"" of the FEMA employees who publicly signed the letter have been placed on administrative leave, including some who were responding to July's deadly floods in Texas.

Newsweek has contacted the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, for comment via emails sent outside regular business hours.

Why It Matters

The letter raised concerns about FEMA's ability to respond to disasters, which can mean life or death during such emergencies.

While the administration has said its decision to place some FEMA employees on leave was not meant as a punishment, the action has raised concerns over whistleblower protections. When employees face consequences for speaking out, it may prevent others from doing so in the future and erode public trust in leadership.

What To Know

According to the Associated Press, it has confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices on Tuesday evening informing them that they would be placed on indefinite leave. The notice said the decision was ""not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.""

In a statement to Newsweek, Stand Up for Science said the government was retaliating against the employees ""for whistleblowing—which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us.""

On social media, some also called it an act of retaliation.

Podcast host Brian Allen said, ""Whistleblowers are being purged for trying to protect disaster response.""

Ron Filipkowski, the editor-in-chief of MeidasTouch, commended those who ""had the courage to sign their names to it knowing the consequences of a highly vindictive Trump.""

In their letter, sent ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the current and former FEMA employees listed six ""statements of opposition"" to current policies at FEMA, including an expenditure approval policy by which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem must approve contracts exceeding $100,000. The signatories said the policy reduces FEMA's ability to perform its mission.

The letter also critiqued the DHS's decision to reassign some FEMA employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as required by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and FEMA's workforce.

The signatories wrote that they hoped their warnings would ""come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

What People Are Saying

Stand Up for Science said in a statement to Newsweek: ""This situation is developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need.

""Once again, we are seeing the federal government retaliate against our civil servants for whistleblowing—which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us. DHS said that these employees are simply 'afraid of change' which is an insult to anyone working at FEMA, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances. Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the FEMA 36.""

Podcast host Brian Allen wrote on X: ""This isn't governance. It's retaliation. Whistleblowers are being purged for trying to protect disaster response.""

Richard Hanania, the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, wrote on X: ""36 FEMA employees put their names to a letter to Congress saying we were underprepared for future emergencies. In response, the Trump administration did what any responsible government would do. It put them on paid leave.""

FEMA spokesperson Daniel Llargues told the Associated Press on Monday that the Trump administration had ""made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help.""

He added: ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.""

What Happens Next

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency, have issued similar statements against the Trump administration's policies. Last month, about 140 employees at the EPA who signed an opposition letter were placed on administrative leave.

It remains to be seen what other actions could come as a result of the FEMA employees' letter.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats Ramping Up Visits to Detention Centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans Hold Firm Even as Public Opinion Shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s Still a Search for Consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_Congress_Deportations_25221593402141-1568x1048.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:56:32.757126

It is easy to talk about leaving, but far harder to build the framework that comes after. Without this work being done, it risks the system being left even weaker than before.

And second, they run the risk of shattering public trust, when people vote for plans that don’t work in practice. If a plan collapses on contact with reality, it hands victory to those who say the crisis cannot be solved at all. Dangerous amateurism could discredit the entire cause of immigration control.

The contrast could not be sharper. Earlier this year, the Conservatives introduced the Deportation Bill – a detailed, workable plan to end this illegal immigration crisis. Our Deportation Bill will take back control of our country’s borders and, importantly, would ensure that every single illegal immigrant would be automatically deported. It would also disapply the Human Rights Act in immigration cases, double the residency requirement for Indefinite Leave to Remain and impose a binding annual cap on legal migration, set each year by Parliament at very low levels.

We laid amendments to legislation that would have raised salary thresholds, capped family visas, mandated age testing and removed foreign criminals as a matter of course. These were carefully worked provisions drafted as primary legislation. Reform have done none of this work and needless to say Labour voted against all our proposals.

We began a new approach in government with the Rwanda plan, backed by a permanent ban on re-entry for anyone entering illegally. But I will honestly say that the last government should have gone a lot further and a lot faster. Under new leadership, we now will. The Conservatives will restore deterrence. If an illegal arrival cannot be removed to their home country, they will be immediately removed to a safe third country. Without returns there is no deterrence, and without deterrence the boats will never stop.

And this is only the beginning. Besides disapplying the Human Rights Act from immigration matters, Conservatives have already launched a full review of the ECHR and the associated treaties, led by Lord Wolfson KC. That review is examining in precise detail how Britain can reassert sovereignty in ways that do not leave us trapped in endless legal quagmires or open to destabilisation. It is easy to talk about a “Bill of Rights”, but easy slogans can create new dangers, handing judges sweeping licence to reinterpret vague concepts of “liberty” and “freedom” against the will of Parliament. We will not risk compounding failure with shortcuts.

Real work means drafting clauses, forcing votes, designing enforcement, and standing ready to deliver on day one of government. It means commissioning an eminent KC to look at the legal challenges so that easy slogans and promises don’t fall apart on contact with reality.

That is what the Conservatives have done. We are not waiting for Nigel Farage to catch up with the detail, we are not waiting for Labour to discover courage, but we will keep pressing for the measures Britain desperately needs.

That is the choice that will be before Britain. A weak Labour Government that won’t do the tough things needed. A Reform party who talk tough but haven’t done the details. Or a changed Conservative Party that has both the willpower and the plan to fix this crisis.

As soon as they take off from the Panamanian coast, there is a sigh of relief. Surrounded by 30 other Venezuelan migrants, packed inside an overloaded midsize speedboat, Edinson holds on tightly to the edge. The 37-year-old is tall and slender and has a presence that stands out as he towers over everyone. Over the past couple of weeks, he’s become the de facto captain of a group of migrants making their way back to Venezuela.

At this point in their long journey, they sit in silence under blue skies and a blazing morning sun. The end is in sight. Sporting a black Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap and a blue T-shirt, Edinson stares out to the crystal clear Caribbean Sea. He knows these waters can be deadly. A couple of months ago, a boat carrying 19 migrants capsized not too far from here, but Edinson tells himself he has survived worse.

The boat is being piloted by two local operators, also known as lancheros, who constantly scoop water to avoid flooding. Dressed in black from head to toe, these lancheros now make a living transporting migrants from Panama’s Colón province in the central, northern part of the country to La Miel, a small town close to the Colombian border. This 12-hour sea route is the only way for migrants to bypass the dense, swampy, deadly Darién jungle that connects the two countries — the only spit of land linking North and South America via Central America. Each person making the voyage had risked their lives once to trek north through the jungle in their attempt to reach the United States. This time, on their way back to Venezuela, they want to avoid it at all costs, even if it means facing those rough Caribbean waters.

It’s 9:19 a.m. by now, the warm water splashing into the boat as it travels parallel to the shoreline, where you can still see lush tropical rainforests in the distance. While Edinson grabs onto the metal handles, one woman in a light-blue plastic poncho, hair flying with the wind, locks arms with her young daughter. In front of them, a young father holds his five-year-old son in his lap, squeezing him tightly as we slam through the big waves. Everyone on board manages to suppress their fear with the simple prospect of returning home. “Solo pienso en llegar, llegar, llegar (I’m just thinking of arriving, arriving, arriving),” Edinson says.

Unbeknownst to him, Edinson is part of a growing trend of “reverse migration” emerging throughout the American continent. A year ago, this movement would have been unimaginable. In 2024, during the Joe Biden administration, more than 300,000 north-bound migrants traversed the Darién Gap. After Donald Trump effectively dismantled the asylum-seeking process during his first administration, hundreds and thousands of migrants, precipitated by the pandemic and critical conditions in their homelands, headed toward the U.S. Those numbers plummeted once Trump took office again and began doubling down on his anti-immigrant agenda. According to the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, only 2,831 people crossed the Darién between January and March 2025, representing a 98 percent decrease compared with 2024. In March, Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino declared that the Darién Gap was effectively closed, proudly noting that his country’s migration crisis was over. Yet that statement overlooks a new, invisible crisis slowly forming in plain sight, miles away from the Darién. Migrants are still risking their lives; they are simply doing it on their way south, not north.

As Reuters first reported in March, more than 2,800 U.S.-bound migrants in Mexico requested assistance from the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM) to return to their homelands in January and February, just weeks after Trump stepped into the White House. Many of those migrants had been waiting in limbo to enter the United States. By June, the IOM estimated that approximately 7,696 southbound migrants had traveled from Panama to Colombia since February. While tracking this data is challenging, the movements on the ground point to a monumental new chapter in the history of migration: the disintegration of the American dream.

“By turning a refugee population into priorities for enforcement, it’s ending a chapter the United States aspired to. It aspired to be a place of refuge,” Andrea Flores, vice president of Immigration Policy and Campaigns at FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration-advocacy group, tells me. “The American dream meant that, regardless of background, our Constitution protected all of these identities and believed that, through our immigration system and the concept of naturalization, you could become an American. That idea of the American dream is ending.”

So, what happens when migrants stop looking north?

Starting Over in the U.S.

Seven months ago, Edinson never imagined he’d be returning to Venezuela.

Like millions living under President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian regime, Edinson, who is the father of two young boys, struggled to provide for his family as a street-market seller of secondhand goods. For decades, Venezuela has undergone a sociopolitical crisis that has stripped citizens of basic civil rights and economic opportunities. Since 2014, close to 8 million Venezuelans have left the country, making it the largest recorded forced-displacement crisis in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the largest in the world.

Edinson watched neighbors pack their bags and flee to the United States, but the idea of leaving his children behind kept him anchored in his hometown of Caja Seca, a small, rural community. He was at peace with the idea of leading a simple life and found joy in the small things — playing basketball with his kids, taking his eldest to practice, and eating dinner with his mother every night. Miles away from Caracas, surrounded by forests, Edinson managed to stay away from the capital’s political turmoil, even as massive protests against Maduro’s crackdown erupted in that city.

But in the summer of 2024, Edinson’s three-year-old son got sick. To help pay for hospital visits and medicine, Edinson traveled to the capital, almost nine hours away, where he sold used clothes and sneakers for quick cash. A couple of weeks and many trips later, Edinson’s savings were gone and he could barely afford to buy groceries. Blaming Madu­ro’s regime, Edinson recognized that the only way for his family to survive was for him to leave Venezuela and go north.

Jorge, one of Edinson’s childhood best friends, had left Caja Seca a couple of years ago and, after receiving humanitarian parole under the Biden administration, ended up working at a tire shop in Indianapolis. Jorge told Edinson about what better opportunities looked like, what it could feel like for Edinson to have enough money in his pockets to help his son. Things weren’t perfect in Indiana, Jorge would tell Edinson, but that sense of suffocation and paranoia was gone, and that was enough to inspire Edinson to start planning. Suddenly, the motivation wasn’t just economic, but the realization that life could be different — free of misery and oppression. He would join Jorge, send cash to his family and, eventually, bring them to America. “That’s the only solution I could find,” Edinson says.

On Oct. 1, 2024, Edinson left Venezuela, beginning a trek north as the United States was in the midst of a heated presidential election with Vice President Kamala Harris’ lead over Trump slowly shrinking. The day Edinson left, Trump held a campaign rally in Milwaukee, warning the crowd about a “mass migrant invasion.” By that point, Trump calling Venezuelan migrants “criminals” and “gang members” had become a core part of his stump speech.

While Trump bet on his nativist, anti-immigrant rhetoric to mobilize voters, Edinson held onto the hope that Americans would be able to see past the fearmongering and baseless attacks. “A lot of people in Caja Seca told me not to go [to the U.S.], and to wait until the election results,” Edinson says. He was convinced that, like previous generations of Venezuelan migrants, he would eventually find a pathway to legalization. Regardless of the political outcome, Edinson trusted the American system.

During 2024, at the height of the migration wave toward the U.S., an average of 3,000 people trekked through the Darién Gap each day. Known as “the world’s most dangerous jungle,” millions of migrants and refugees risked their lives and attempted to cross it during the Biden years, despite the administration’s attempts to restrict asylum. Still, Edinson thought he would have the chance to start a new life in the U.S.

The American Dream

In October, it took Edinson almost four days to cross the Darién Gap by foot, passing four corpses during the last stretch of the jungle: the emaciated remains of a mother and daughter who died hugging; a woman who looked like she’d just been shot in the head; the decomposed body of what appeared to be an elderly man; and many, many human bones and skulls lined the edges of the swampy, overgrown paths.

As soon as Edinson emerged from the Darién Gap and reached the small Panamanian town of Bajo Chiquito, he called his mother back in Caja Seca. “Don’t ever do this,” he told her. He rested for a few days in the town’s makeshift migrant camp full of asylum seekers who had just braved the jungle and were in dire need of urgent care. From there, Edinson would take several buses through Central America to Mexico, where he would begin the process to request asylum in the United States.

Back in 2021, a couple of days after Biden’s inauguration, I spent a week reporting from the Darién Gap. What haunted me wasn’t what I could see and hear around me — the dangerous wildlife, the gasps of pain from Haitian mothers as they carried their weeping children through the hills on bloody, blistered feet, the trails of abandoned backpacks — rather, it was everything I couldn’t see. What haunted me the most was migrants’ blind loyalty to the ideals that pushed them toward the U.S. Their capacity to face any risk — even death — in the pursuit of freedom, justice, and liberty. Having lived through authoritarianism, gang violence, and/or poverty, they understood how sacred America’s rights were, how vital our Constitution was, and the privilege our democracy represented. “Is the American dream worth this?” I’d ask along the trek. The answer was always a resounding yes.

In 1931, author and historian James Truslow Adams was one of the first to introduce the concept of the American dream in his book The Epic of America. Adams, who was born into a wealthy Brooklyn family, originally explained it as a “dream of a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank.” Many scholars took issue with this limited characterization, pointing to its materialistic and capitalistic nature. Since, generations of ordinary Americans, presidents, politicians, and historians have continued to redefine the term, using it as an anchor to unify our perpetually polarized nation. For decades, the American dream has been framed as an open-ended quest that had yet to be fully realized.

Historically, immigrants trekking to the U.S. each day have carried the aspiration of that dream. From the more than 30 million Europeans who arrived between 1815 and 1915 to the birth of the Chicano movement and the rise of Cesar Chavez’s farmworkers to the mass mobilization of Dreamers, generations of immigrants have shaped America’s own commitment to that vision. But as hundreds of migrants begin to self-deport and as thousands of asylum seekers turn away from the southern border, choosing new paths for themselves, it seems that Adams’ American dream was just that — simply a dream.

Edinson came to that conclusion shortly after he arrived in Mexico, now just miles away from the U.S. After surviving the Darién jungle and crisscrossing through Central America, Edinson arrived in the Mexican city of Tapachula on Oct. 14, 2024, less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election. He applied for asylum through CBP One, a controversial mobile application allowing migrants at the southern border to schedule appointments at designated U.S. ports of entry. This process became one of the only ways to legally enter at the U.S.-Mexico border under Biden, as the administration attempted to handle a surge of new arrivals.

Based on a lottery system, migrants would sometimes wait months for their appointment in extremely dangerous conditions. The cartels often run these border towns and have historically subjected migrants to kidnappings, extortions, and sexual violence. Yet, once migrants were screened and vetted by immigration officers, many were eventually released on parole in the U.S.

“In Mexico, you live in fear every single day,” Edinson says. “There’s no peace of mind there. But the plan was always to wait and get to the U.S.” As Edinson waited in limbo, he got a job as a tire repairer. He shared a tiny two-bedroom apartment with 14 other Venezuelan migrants. Each night, he slept on a thin foam mattress on a floor, surrounded by strangers connected by the hope that America would reject Trump’s vision. Paralyzed by fear from Tapachula’s cartel violence, Edinson barely left that apartment.

By Nov. 5, Edinson understood that the land that lured him didn’t want him there. Like his roommates, Edinson found out about the election results through social media, as he anxiously scrolled Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Edinson received conflicting advice. His friend Jorge encouraged him to continue his journey, even if it meant paying coyotes to get smuggled through the southern border. Edinson’s mom urged him to go back home to Caja Seca. With Trump in power, she no longer saw a pathway for her son.

Edinson stayed the course. He wasn’t alone. As the Associated Press reported, more than 2,000 migrants in southern Mexico began walking toward the U.S. the morning Trump was sworn in. By the time the sun set, his administration had declared a national emergency at the border, shut down the CBP One application, revoked key humanitarian parole programs, attempted to repeal birthright citizenship, and laid the groundwork for its mass-deportation machine. A couple of days later, as millions of immigrants went back into the shadows, American military planes started deporting dozens of migrants to Guatemala. As FWD.us’ Flores says, “Trump’s unique targeting of Venezuelans during the 2024 campaign was the preview of everything you are seeing now.”

From Indianapolis, Jorge kept Edinson abreast of the news. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids were picking up, more deportation flights were taking off, and local police were starting to act like federal immigration agents. Even though Jorge had legal status, it felt like a matter of time until someone came knocking on his door. By mid-March, Jorge’s tone changed when the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act and deported 137 Venezuelan men to El Salvador without due process, accusing them of being gang members and national-security threats. Haunted by the demeaning photo ops of Venezuelan men paraded around El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s mega-prison, Jorge told Edinson he was scared to leave his house and end up behind bars in a foreign country.

Few things can quell an immigrant’s determination. Some will hide in corners, others will walk with more caution, many will perpetually wait in limbo until better opportunities arise. I’ve met Cuban migrants who have waited more than two years along the southern border for a chance to enter the U.S. Immigrants have historically held on to a form of unwavering hope that dissipates only when their luck runs out.

While Edinson watched the way Jorge’s life was at the mercy of immigration officials, however, he decided the chance for a new life in America wasn’t worth it. “When I saw that they [the U.S. government] were taking away my own people, the same anxiety I felt in Venezuela started to sink in,” Edinson says. “To leave a dictatorship only to walk into that? It’s preferable to leave that behind.” After waiting in Mexico for six months, Edinson decided to turn back.

As Edinson thought through the logistics of his return home, he had one condition: No matter what, he wouldn’t go through the Darién Gap again. Dead people. Hills. Wild animals. Criminals preying on migrants. As he planned another way back, he came across a small group of Venezuelans also plotting their return. They spent weeks hustling for money around Tapachula. During the days, some worked as street vendors, construction workers, or in factories, packing mangoes. In the evenings, they came together to talk about the different routes around the Darién Gap. Through word of mouth, they learned migrants were boarding small boats by Panama’s Caribbean coast and taking a long sea route to Colombia that allowed them to bypass the jungle. They also heard that back in February, an eight-year-old Venezuelan child died after one of those boats sank. But Edinson suddenly felt the same way he did as he migrated north: The risk was worth it.

Against the Tide

On April 19, 2025, at 9 p.m., Edinson boarded a bus in Tapachula and began the first stretch of his trip, a three-day journey that would take him all the way to Costa Rica.

In Spanish, contracorriente means to go against the tide. The word perfectly captures Edinson’s journey through Central America on roads paved for migrants who fled in the other direction. From Mexico, there were those who rushed to California for gold or to the Texas farmlands for work throughout the 19th century; from Guatemala and Honduras, countless asylum seekers searched for new beginnings in Florida after escaping the maras and dangerous mudslides; from Nicaragua, its war-torn populous sought American democracy during the Cold War.

By April 22, after days on the road, Edinson made it to Costa Rica. That night, I met him for the first time, by a bus stop in Paso Canoas, a small town on the border between Costa Rica and Panama. Smoking a cigarette as he paced back and forth, he was surrounded by a group of Venezuelan men he had met on the bus ride to Paso Canoas. They were all young dads in their twenties and thirties who traveled solo to the U.S., now on their way back home to their kids.

“When the border with the U.S. closed, everyone’s dreams stopped existing,” says Edinson, whose tall silhouette covers the street lights shining over us. “One tries to forget about that, but the feeling remains.”

Luis, a 30-year-old father of three young kids, chimes in: “We’ve been talking about this the whole way here.… I think we are the beginning of a new wave. If they closed the door on us, we have to find a new horizon.”

That night, Edinson and his friends will rest in a nearby hostel mostly occupied by migrants and pay smugglers $40 each to be transported by charter bus from Paso Canoas into Panama in the late hours of the night, when Panamanian immigration authorities are more likely to turn a blind eye.

Paso Canoas has always been an important transit town for northbound migrants. During peak migration periods in 2023, the Costa Rican government, along with aid groups on the ground, implemented a relatively sound protection system that allowed for safe passage, opening a temporary migrant care center, adopting busing programs to transport migrants from its southern border to its northern one, and working closely with the United Nations to coordinate humanitarian assistance. During those years, the streets were bustling, there was a robust presence of aid workers, and local business owners kept their fresh-fruit stands open all day. Then, shortly after Trump took office, an eerie quiet took over the town. By the second week of February, aid workers noticed asylum seekers were coming through from America, instead of the south.

Today, locals estimate that more than 100 southbound migrants pass through Paso Canoas each day. The majority are Venezuelans who left Mexico after waiting in limbo following the 2024 election. There are also a significant number of migrants who either self-deported or were turned away by immigration authorities at U.S. ports of entry.

Every afternoon, Sister Claudia Cuadra, a nun from Chile, posts up by the bus station and waits for migrant buses to arrive. She escorts as many people as she can back to a small church turned dining hall offering free meals and basic services. Paso Canoas is now mostly run by nuns. The Trump administration’s foreign-aid freeze suspended crucial regional programs that offered shelter, food, hydration, hygiene, and legal aid to migrants, forcing some aid groups to exit the region altogether. As Refugees International recently reported, in just four months, the Trump administration dismantled Costa Rica’s protection infrastructure. This spurred a number of faith-based organizations to fill the void.

One rainy afternoon, I see the nuns in action, opening their doors to a group of about 20 migrants lined up outside the church. Some nuns pass out lunch boxes, while others play with the fidgety children and offer single mothers an extra hand. While Sister Adriana Calzada Vazquez Vela hands out food, she tells me migrants arriving here from the north are often hungry, exhausted, and resigned. “There’s a sadness,” she says. “There’s disappointment because there was a dream that became lost or broken.”

Humanitarian experts say reverse migrating is a traumatic experience, perhaps even more so than going north. Caitlyn Yates, an anthropologist at the University of British Columbia and a volunteer with Refugees International, explains that grappling with the end of hope is the most difficult part. At this point in their journey, still operating on adrenaline and survival instinct, they’ve barely processed what they’ve seen along the way. “They carry the grief and trauma of having crossed through the Darién,” says Ivan Aguilar, a humanitarian coordinator for Oxfam. “Almost all of them have seen someone die or disappear … and now they have to return.”

When I ask these experts if there is anything comparable, a similar pattern of reverse migration that has taken place in another part of the globe, they struggle to come up with an answer. Aguilar points out that after living in the U.S. for 30 or 40 years, some migrants choose to retire in their home countries. But this is different, he stresses: “The reverse migration we are seeing is due to the impossibility of reaching a final destination.”

A New Beginning

Sitting in the church’s dining hall, just miles away from the foot of the jungle, migrants weigh the same question Edinson had been pondering: how to avoid the Darién Gap.

Barajas Marquez, a 39-year-old Venezuelan playing with his son inside the church, doesn’t have the cash to pay for the boat. He’s trying to save enough money to give his family options. He says he knows of those desperate enough to consider going back through the jungle by foot. Edinson spent weeks working at the tire shop in Tapachula so he could afford the sea route, which is a little less than the $330 Edinson paid back in October 2024 to be smuggled by foot through the Darién jungle by the Gulf Clan, a Colombian paramilitary group. “It’s dangerous,” Edinson admits. “It’s unclear what can happen to us during so many hours.… What if the sea is choppy?” Luckily, he knows how to swim.

I meet Edinson at 2 a.m. by the same bus stop he had arrived at earlier that day. I knew this was the time that his group planned to make moves, when the town was asleep. Edinson and three other men walk briskly toward the border crossing with Panama, just a couple of feet away. A larger group of about 25 migrants quietly emerges from the surrounding streets and joins Edinson’s pack. They all move silently through a back alley that allows them to circumvent the Panamanian immigration authorities.

In the daytime, this intersection, which sits on the Pan-American Highway, is one of the busiest land crossings in Central America, as it’s a major hub for commercial traffic. Truck drivers sometimes wait in line for more than five hours just to get processed by immigration authorities. But at night, Panamanian immigration officials have mostly grown accustomed to looking the other way as migrants quietly tiptoe around the system.

A couple of minutes later, already on the Panamanian side, the group congregates by a charter bus stationed by the sidewalk, engine turned on, luggage-compartment hood wide open, ready to go. The silence turns into chaos as migrants frantically put their bags inside the bus and reach out with their cash — $25, the cost of being smuggled across Panama. I ask Edinson if he knows anything about the bus driver — who he is, who he works for, why he’s there. He doesn’t. The bus pulls away, taking the migrants to David, a city in western Panama. From there, Edinson will take several buses until he reaches the country’s eastern coast. That’s where the boats await.

Every day, hundreds of migrants like Edinson take off from the Panamanian province of Colón as they embark on their final stretch home. This may feel like a win for a Trump administration that prides itself on pressuring people into self-deporting and turning around. From up close, though, the act of leaving looks, for many, more like an act of freedom. That’s particularly evident in Colón, where there’s an emotional shift, when even those who feel defeated and terrified to return to the homelands from which they fled, begin to see more opportunities back in the south than up north. Perhaps it’s that their journey is almost over, that they are hours away from hugging their loved ones, or that they’ve had enough time to self-reflect. The region of Colón has a deep history of liberation.

This port played an important role during the transatlantic slave trade, when European colonizers forcefully brought millions of enslaved Africans to Panama. The enslaved people later revolted and eventually established settlements along the coast. Centuries later, the province of Colón is now inhabited by a majority Afro-Panamanian population.

Surrounded by rainforests, old colonial towns are filled with churches, squares, and ancient structures covered in a chipped, colorful, bright paint. Here, time moves slowly. After 24 hours on the road, cruising full speed toward the east coast, Edinson finally makes it to Palenque, a tiny beach town in Colón.

The morning of April 24, I meet Edinson by Palenque’s wooden dock. He’s still with the other young Venezuelan dads he’d met up with in Tapachula, but he’s now part of another, newly formed group of migrants waiting to board the two-engine boat. There’s Genesis, a 31-year-old woman who’d spent months in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, right by McAllen, Texas. She doesn’t know how to swim and is petrified to get on the boat, especially after hearing that one of them capsized in February. There’s Alessandro, also in his early thirties who, 10 days prior, self-deported from Ohio. His arms covered in tattoos, Alessandro is scared DHS would label him as a gang member and send him to El Salvador.

As we talk near the dock, I ask Edinson the same question I asked migrants in 2021 when we trekked north through the Darién jungle — was the American dream worth it? “I wouldn’t go back to the United States,” he says with certainty.

Edinson stuffs his backpack into a plastic bag. He puts on a life vest handed to him by one of the local Afro-Panamanian men organizing the boat rides. These men — coyotes of some sort, part of a well-oiled informal migrant-transportation machine — are collecting $280 per person. It will take about 12 hours to reach La Miel, Panama. From there, Edinson will get onto another boat to Colombia and continue his journey to Venezuela by bus. He hopes to be in Caja Seca in less than 48 hours. “Are you nervous? Anxious?” I ask him. “No, just anxious to get home,” he says.

Edinson knows Venezuela’s conditions haven’t gotten any better with Maduro still in power. He cannot wait to hug his boys, but what worries him most is not being able to buy his 12-year-old everything he needs for his basketball games. He’s not sure how long he’ll last in Venezuela. As soon as he gets home, Edinson will plot his next journey.

The migrants form two lines along the dock. Men on the right, women and their children on the left. The women enter the boat one by one and sit in the back, followed by the men, a couple of whom move closer to the engines to join their wives and squeeze their kids. Edinson and his friends sit by the tip of the boat, packed in with 30 people who are all part of a new chapter of history, the beginning of a new “Great Reverse Migration.” When they get home, they will tell their children, their grandchildren, and generations to come that America didn’t live up to its ideals, that the dream could be chased elsewhere. They will get out a map and look for new horizons. In turn, James Truslow Adams’ Epic of America could come to an end.

Right before the lancheros take off from the dock, a local Afro-Panamanian woman approaches the boat. She kneels down and prays out loud for them. The migrants begin cheering from the boat. The woman gets on her feet and yells “Hoy es un dia que se va a desatar algo” — “Today is a day when something will unleash.”

As the boat takes off, going against the tide, Edinson sighs as if a weight has been lifted.

A few weeks later, he’s back in Caja Seca with his family, making $50 a week as a delivery person, trying to save enough money to move to Chile. “I have life, health, and, more than anything, peace of mind,” Edinson says. “No one can take that away from me.”

A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said.","As overcrowding at Florida’s largest immigrant detention center ballooned this year, the emergency calls flooded in.

“I got a gentleman here, new arrival detainee, he’s complaining of chest pains.”

“We have a detainee having a seizure.”

“We got a new arrival detainee here that’s complaining of lightheadedness.”

Krome Processing Center’s average daily population has climbed from less than 600 at the start of the Trump administration to 900 in July according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement – and that’s likely a significant undercount. In April, Krome’s population reached three times its capacity with more 1,800 detainees, according to data gathering organization Transitional Records Action Clearinghouse, which obtained additional public records from ICE to provide a fuller picture beyond the average population data ICE regularly publishes.

As Krome burst at the seams with new detainees, emergency calls have risen faster than the detainee population.

From January to July, 911 calls made from the detention center doubled compared to the same time period the year before, according to records released from the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office. More than 170 calls were made this year until July 15, compared to 86 in the same time period the year before. This year, about half of the calls have been related to a sick or injured person, compared to just 25% of the calls last year. Other common reasons for the calls were an arrest or investigation.

That tracks with a similar trend at ICE’s Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, where 911 calls are also on track to double from last year, according to data obtained and analyzed by The Tributary last month.

But at Krome, Florida’s largest detention center, the problems are particularly acute: Interviews with lawyers and detainees’ relatives, 911 call logs and recordings, and ICE’s own records show that overcrowding and medical neglect have run rampant at Krome since Trump took office. The detention center has also been the deadliest this year, with at least three deaths.

As the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation machine and Gov. Ron DeSantis has wielded the full force of the state’s law enforcement to help, no ICE detention center has exceeded its capacity more than Miami’s Krome, according to a report by TRAC.

“It is absolutely horrendous,” said Chelsea Nowel, a Tampa-based immigration lawyer with multiple clients who have been detained at Krome. “It’s not something that I’ve ever experienced before in practicing detained immigration for almost 10 years.”

Ramped up enforcement

Since President Donald Trump took office, immigration enforcement has intensified, targeting immigrants at their workplace, courthouses, and immigration check-ins. With Gov. Ron DeSantis as an eager partner, Florida’s immigrant communities have borne the brunt of ramped up ICE activity.

With most Florida law enforcement agencies required to collaborate with ICE, a routine traffic stop now can lead to detention without so much as a citation — let alone a criminal arrest. Changes to mandatory detention have also meant that immigrants without a criminal record and with ties to their community who may have been released on bond under past administrations are now spending months in ICE detention. More than half of the people detained at Krome have no criminal record, according to the latest ICE statistics on the detained population.

“What we’re seeing is how politicians across the political spectrum have sold us that immigration is a public safety issue, but it’s not,” said Florida-based senior organizer for the Detention Watch Network Nery Lopez. “In reality, we’re seeing that people are being incarcerated, being detained and deported and having no due process.”

As the largest detention center in the state, Krome has been the site of many of these detentions and the population quickly surged.

Within a month of Trump’s inauguration, 44-year-old Ukrainian immigrant Maksym Chernyak died in custody after being transferred to the hospital after having a seizure. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner determined the cause of death as a stroke. In August, his family filed a wrongful death complaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Overcrowding only increased at Krome in the following months. In April, Democratic lawmakers in Florida called the conditions at Krome “alarming” and demanded more oversight. In June, detainees used their bodies to spell out SOS to protest the conditions and prolonged detention.

Even ICE has noted overcrowding at Krome. In the latest ICE inspection conducted from April 29 to May 1, the agency documented 14 instances when the facility failed to comply with national detention standards, compared to 6 during the last inspection in September 2024. Most of the issues were related to the holding rooms or medical care.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Ron Smock, who often visited his friend Vangelis Ricardo Dos Anjos Gomes, a Brazilian immigrant who was detained at Krome from October 2024 to April 2025, watched as more and more people crowded the facilities during his visits. In the spring, he saw detainees eating and sleeping in a room meant for lawyer visits.

The overcrowding climbed steadily until June, which saw the largest 911 call volume since January 2024 with 53 calls. That same month, 75-year-old Isidro Perez died in ICE custody after reporting chest pains and being transferred to the hospital, according to ICE. The medical examiner has not yet released an autopsy or report on his death.

A 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, whose wife spoke to The Tributary on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation, got to Krome in June after being detained at an ICE check-in in Tampa. By then, according to the immigrant’s wife, the intake process was so overwhelmed that detainees were forced to sleep on the floor for days and weeks at a time.

“He was there for a whole week in horrible conditions, where you couldn’t shower and had the same clothes on all week, with a toilet in the same room where you were,” the immigrant’s wife said in an interview. “The capacity was supposedly for 25 people, but there were up to 60 people there.”

Mich González, a lawyer for Sanctuary of the South who represents clients in Krome, said the overcrowding has created inhumane conditions.

“People were held in processing for over a week and in processing, you don’t get regular access to meals, bathroom, potable water. You have to ask to go to the bathroom,” González said.

“There’s no beds. You have to sleep on the floor. People were so cold, they were sticking cardboard in the vents and trying to hold them in place with plastic forks.”

At least four 911 calls regarding medical emergencies mentioned that the person was a new arrival who had not yet been booked into Krome, stuck instead in a limbo in which the facility’s medical staff were not yet authorized to attend to them.

“I have a detainee over here that’s complaining of chest pains,” one caller said on May 24. “Nurse staff told me to call 911 because they can’t see him because he’s not all the way booked in yet.”

In its latest inspection report, ICE documented that at least two out of six holding rooms at Krome exceeded the 25-person capacity and three exceeded the 12-hour wait time in the holding room. It also documented a failure of all the holding rooms to document detainees held there, meal times, and security concerns. Krome staff also failed to provide proper mental and medical health screenings upon arrival, the report found.

When Rep. Carlos Gimenez visited, the 36-year-old Cuban immigrant said ICE staffers took steps to get the facility more in regular order: All the men were moved out of the intake center, he later told his wife.

Gimenez told media after his visit that he did not witness any overcrowding or detainees sleeping on the floor and that the medical care was adequate.

“It’s not the Ritz, but I can tell you that there’s nothing going on in there that would be cause for alarm,” Gimenez told the media after his visit.

The office of Rep. Gimenez did not respond to a request for further comment.

Issues with medical care

Once inside Krome, overcrowding persisted and detainees reported having to request a medical appointment but waiting days to receive care, according to lawyers, relatives, a wrongful death complaint and a report by Human Rights Watch.

Smock said that Gomes, the Brazilian friend he’d regularly visited at Krome, relayed that there were 120 people in his pod, which was only supposed to hold 60 people. He spent two months in solitary confinement, which he preferred to the overcrowding and abuse he endured with the general population.

“When solitary is a better option, that shows how horrible things are,” Smock said.

The 911 calls reflect a general deterioration of the conditions at Krome and the issues with medical care, which is provided by ICE Health Service Corps. They document head injuries, chest pains, stroke symptoms, and multiple seizures.

The wife of Maksym Chernyak, the Ukrainian man who died in February, alleges that he sought medical treatment multiple times but was denied care, according to a wrongful death complaint shared with the Tributary.

Chernyak reported feeling sick and was seen by doctors on Feb. 9. Despite complaining of the same symptoms, he waited 6 days for another medical visit. His blood pressure rose by this second visit, but nothing was done, the complaint alleges. When he began vomiting and having seizures in the early hours of Feb. 18, Krome staff waited nearly four hours before calling for emergency medical care.

Smock also reported that Gomes experienced long wait times for critical medical care. It took a week to see a doctor after he fell in the courtyard and scraped his leg, which became infected with flesh-eating bacteria, Smock said.

“They kept refusing him to get treated. They finally sent him to the hospital and the hospital filed notice about how bad his condition was. He was only hours away from having his legs amputated,” Smock said.

Injuries inside Krome were common for Gomes because he was repeatedly targeted and attacked by other detainees and guards for being gay, according to Smock.

Gomes was indicted in March on two charges of forcibly assaulting a federal officer, a case that Smock believes is retaliation for filing a complaint with DHS after guards forcibly restrained and beat Gomes.

Delays in receiving medical care at Krome were common, according to interviews and a Human Rights Watch report.

One man spent a week asking for medical care for a cough, the HRW report said. He only received treatment when he showed his bloody tissue. Another waited three weeks for treatment for flu-like symptoms. A nurse wrote off his issues as marijuana withdrawal symptoms.

Another complained of abdominal pain, according to the report. An officer said that did not warrant a medical emergency. The in-house doctor said it was probably just gas. When he was finally taken to the hospital, the doctor said he had arrived just in time before his intestines ruptured from a strangulated abdominal wall hernia.

A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said. A Guatemalan woman told Smock that her husband had been attacked and fell and started having seizures, even though he was only in his 30s. The 911 calls report multiple seizures of inmates in their 30s.

All these issues could be avoided, or at least mitigated, if the government used its discretion to release people with serious health issues, family responsibilities and no criminal record as was customary in the past, according to Nowel, the Tampa immigration attorney. But instead detention only seems to be increasing.

“It’s so much worse than we’ve ever seen before and all for nothing,” Nowel said. “There is no reason for any of this to be happening.”

PHILIPSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA – Early on Sunday morning, members of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) gathered in the parking lot in East Liberty to go to Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, an old coal mining town in Central Pennsylvania. The coal mines have closed, and the town’s largest employer is ICE’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center, operated by the private prison contractor GEO Group.

The Moshannon Valley Processing Center is the largest ICE facility in the Northeastern United States and is considered one of the most inhumane.

On average, 147 immigrants per month have been locked in solitary confinement, nearly twice the national average for an ICE facility. The conditions are so brutal inside the prison that one detainee, Chaofeng Ge, killed himself in 2025. The suicide has helped bring attention to the facility’s problems.

Members of the group are excited, but some are nervous to protest in a small town like Philipsburg, deep in Trump country.

“A lot of people are scared and don’t know what to do, but we can point them in the right direction,” says June Wearden as the bus attempts to leave the parking lot in Pittsburgh. But then the bus gets stuck, and the driver is unable to navigate the turns to leave the parking lot.

Members of the PSL hop out of the bus to help it navigate around. At one point, the bus driver exclaims, “I don’t think I can get it out of this parking lot.”

Eventually, the PSL members help the bus driver to navigate, driving the charter bus over a median and, after 20 minutes of trying, escaping the parking lot to get on the road to the Moshannon Valley.

“I was nervous that we wouldn’t even get out of the parking lot,” says Wearden.

After a three-hour drive through the Appalachian mountains, the bus arrives at a lakeside park in Moshannon Valley. There are hundreds of protestors, who traveled from all over the state, some even waving Mexican flags as some truckers drive by honking their horns in solidarity. In contrast, Trump supporters drive by yelling at the protestors.

“I wanted to show that I was proud to be Mexican,” says Angelica Medina, carrying a Mexican flag and dressed in a large traditional Chiapaneco dress. “I wanted to show that I’m not afraid to be Mexican in a place like this.”

The rally is held at the Cold Stream Dam and Memorial Park, a picturesque lakeside setting in the mountains. Local residents fish from the lakeshore, looking on with amusement at the rally.

Philipsburg’s Republican mayor, John Streno, even showed up with a cigar in hand to take in the spectacle.

“I don’t agree with the protestors,” says Streno between puffs on his cigar. “But I support their right to protest.”

Not everyone is as nice or friendly as Streno.

“Fuck you, fuck you,” yells one person as they drive by. As protestors attempt to cross the highway into the park, one driver attempts to barrel through the crowd, but is stopped as protestors fail to yield.

“This is a Trump town though and I’m putting my neck out to say it, because I could be firebombed tonight,” says Philipsburg town councilman Luther Gette, who helped to organize the protest. “I already had a rock thrown through my window, but I’m taking that risk because I think it is definitely time for people to speak up.”

Luther Gette is 87 years old and the only Democrat of the seven members of the town council. He says that he’s never seen a protest this big before in Philipsburg.

“I never imagined that I would see a protest this big in Philipsburg,” says Gette.

Before the protest, there had been little discussion of the ICE facility located in their community. But now with activists from all over the state descending on Philipsburg, there has been much debate over the facility, with the local newspaper doing stories on allegations of abuse at the prison. Clearfield County Commissioner John Sobel has even had to take to the press to defend his decision to keep the facility open.

“Opinions are divided, and the main sticking point is the fact that there are jobs,” says Gette. “Old coal mining towns basically have no income,” says Gette. “A prison is a good source of jobs at any point. And I wouldn’t want to say that the people who work in these prisons are necessarily criminals, but there are better ways to make a living.”

But with debate raging over the ICE facility in Philipsburg, Gette says that some former guards have come forward to denounce conditions in the facility.

“We’ve had a quick education on this in the last couple of weeks. I knew for a long time that that prison was out there, that detention facility, but I wasn’t aware of the alleged abuses,” says Gette.

Many townspeople object to out-of-town people coming to Philipsburg to protest the facility. However, activists say that their communities are intricately linked to Philipsburg, as immigrants from their communities are being sent there.

Jamie Martinez is a community defense organizer with the Pittsburgh-based immigrants’ rights group Casa San Jose. He says that many immigrants detained in Pittsburgh, over three hours away, get sent to Moshannon Valley. A few weeks ago, Martinez visited a detainee in the facility and, even as an experienced immigrant rights organizer, found himself horrified. He says that he visited a friend who was detained for nine days without any prison official speaking to him.

“He would bang on the door for hours to be able to speak on the phone for somebody,” says Martinez. “And time and time again, like nobody explained anything in a language he could understand. And there was no clear process where he would be met without answers. He spent weeks like that.”

Equally troubling, the man was only given one change of underwear.

“When I arrive at this visitation area and see him come out, he’s wearing a red jumpsuit,” says Martinez. “And he begins to tell me that that’s the only jumpsuit that he had, that he couldn’t wash his clothes, wash his underwear, in his cell in solitary confinement, where he had been for nine days, and he pulled his collar forward like this, and he showed me the yellow sweat stains.”

ICE often pressures people to sign self-deportation papers by treating them poorly while in detention. Martinez says that immigrants in detention are aware of the protests that give them hope. Each night, the immigrants not in solitary confinement gather in their pods to praise and try to encourage one another to keep their spirits up.

“The inmates in there, they give me hope,” says Martinez. “They tell me that every night, they gather their chairs in a large circle in one of the pods, and they pray together for hours, and they build community among each other. And that’s the way in which we’re able to realize, even through the darkest of times, we can do something good. We can find that hope, that light.”

Chris Rabb, a Black state representative in Philadelphia, who is running for US Congress, says the movement against the Moshannon Valley ICE detention center inspired him to travel nearly four hours to speak at the protest. He says that it’s crucial to bridge the urban-rural divide in connecting movements in Pennsylvania.

“If you’re so arrogant to think that all the best ideas and all the best people come from places that you live in and look like, you’ve already lost,” says Rabb. “It takes us out of our physical comfort zone, also our cultural comfort zones. I don’t feel comfortable coming to these parts of Pennsylvania as a Black man alone, but this is what we need to do to build the movement.”

Interestingly, Rabb tells the crowd that some Democrats in his own party don’t feel comfortable with backing protests like these.

“There’s a lot of Democrats who wish I wasn’t here. I make it difficult for them to remain silent,” Rabb tells the crowd. “But I’m not going to be silent, particularly when I look across this amazing group of humanity and you inspire me, I know that as a public servant, there’s a responsibility for me to inspire you, but in this moment, you inspire me to do the work that all elected officials should do.”

The energy of the protests is helping mobilize some Democrats to speak out. When she found out about the rally in Philipsburg, US Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pittsburgh decided to coordinate a surprise visit to the facility on Monday to keep attention focused on the facility.

However, Lee was denied the right to enter the facility despite being the ranking Democrat on the US House Oversight subcommittee on federal law enforcement, including ICE. Lee says that not allowing her to enter the facility is a violation of the Constitution since she has direct oversight over it.

“Last year, Congress passed a law that explicitly prohibits DHS from preventing members of Congress from entering any facilities operated by them. The law also clarifies that members of Congress are not required to provide prior notice before entering any such facilities for oversight purposes,” said Lee in an interview with Payday Report. “Denying us entry is another example of [the] Trump administration’s executive overreach.”

Congresswoman Lee says that the protest movement against Moshannon is helping to put pressure on ICE.

“Of course, [these protests] have an effect, because they’ve reached the attention of members of Congress, they’ve garnered the attention of the press who are now shining a light on this facility and others like it,” said Lee.

As abuses of immigrants get more attention, polling shows that Americans have solidly turned against Trump’s immigration policies. According to a Gallup poll, disapproval of Trump’s immigration approach outweighs approval by a record 27 points.

Lee says that her Congressional office has been contacted by local townspeople who worked in the ICE detention facility, who are upset about conditions.

“We have also heard reports of a number of people leaving that facility, of quitting. There is information that trickles out from the facility itself,” says Lee. She says that right now, the key is to keep attention focused on the Moshannon Valley ICE detention center.

Activists plan to continue protesting the facility and have erected billboards around Philipsburg to draw attention to the abuses within the facility. These billboards also provide information on ways local people can get involved in organizing efforts against the facility.

“So I hope, and especially in light of our inability to get in, that there is still pressure that’s coming in from the press,” says Lee. “We expect that pressure to come from folks in the town, from folks who are impacted or who are doing advocacy.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23430/download/Payday%20Report%20082725%20teaser.jpg?cb=566b4c3f32c365c68b7ff306dc26bbe2&w=1024,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:49.605212

Following widespread pressure, including from the supreme court, the Trump administration returned him to the US in June.
But over the weekend, the Trump administration announced new plans to deport him to Uganda.
She also reportedly said she would not order Ábrego released from immigration custody, leaving that decision for an immigration judge.
In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation had been due to an “administrative error”.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Kilmar Ábrego García, who was already wrongfully deported once, cannot be deported again until at least early October, according to multiple reports.

CNN reported that the US district judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the case, scheduled an evidentiary hearing for 6 October, and said that she intends to have Trump administration officials testify about the government’s efforts to re-deport Ábrego.

At the same hearing, Ábrego’s lawyers informed the court that he plans to seek asylum in the United States, according to the Associated Press.

Ábrego’s case has drawn national attention since he was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March.

Following widespread pressure, including from the supreme court, the Trump administration returned him to the US in June. Upon his return, however, he immediately faced criminal charges related to human smuggling, allegations that his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”.

Ábrego, who is 30 years old and a Salvadorian native, was released from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday while awaiting trial.

But over the weekend, the Trump administration announced new plans to deport him to Uganda.

Then on Monday, Ábrego was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) during a scheduled immigration check-in in Baltimore, which was one of the conditions of his release.

He is currently being held in a detention center in Virginia.

Ábrego’s legal team swiftly filed a lawsuit on Monday, challenging both his current detention and his potential deportation to Uganda. In court filings, they argued that the government is retaliating against Ábrego for challenging his deportation to El Salvador.

“The only reason he was taken into detention was to punish him,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney representing Ábrego, on Monday. “To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.”

Later on Monday, Xinis issued a ruling temporarily barring the government from deporting Ábrego until at least Friday. On Wednesday, she extended her order until Ábrego’s current deportation challenge in court is resolved, according to ABC News.

It added that Xinis said she would issue a ruling within 30 days of the 6 October hearing, and also ordered that Ábrego must remain in custody within a 200-mile (320km) radius of the court in Maryland.

She also reportedly said she would not order Ábrego released from immigration custody, leaving that decision for an immigration judge.

Ábrego entered the US without authorization around 2011 as a teenager. According to court documents, he was fleeing gang violence.

In 2019, a federal court granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador. Despite that ruling, in March, he was mistakenly deported there by the Trump administration.

In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation had been due to an “administrative error”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac5761cc070ae1b4e708933e5619c1c70cc4d082/14_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe59649ccdd2d5cf86c88e317d0d454f",N,,2025-08-27 15:56:46.369917

In this edition, we focus on the topics currently dominating congressional investigations, the post-August recess legislative landscape, and how the looming midterms might impact the investigative strategy of Democrats and Republicans alike, among other topics.

Hot Topics: DEI, Higher Education, Online Censorship, and China

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Since day one, the Trump administration has prioritized investigating DEI programs in both the public and private sectors, and congressional oversight has followed suit. Shortly after President Trump took office, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, initiated an investigation into federal funding awarded by the National Science Foundation for DEI-related initiatives. More recently, on June 25, 2025, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing entitled “Sacrificing Excellence for Ideology: The Real Cost of DEI.” Members have further mirrored this policy agenda in their legislative efforts, introducing bills to eliminate DEI practices in the federal government and other entities, such as institutions of higher education.

Higher education. Congress and the Trump administration remain focused on colleges and universities, particularly with regard to DEI initiatives, tuition pricing, hiring practices, and antisemitism on campus. On April 8, 2025, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to various universities requesting information on alleged collusion on tuition pricing. The Committee has since followed up with multiple institutions by issuing subpoenas for related documents and communications. Leadership of the House Committee on Education and Workforce also sent letters on March 27, 2025, to five universities demanding answers regarding their efforts to address antisemitism. As students return to campus this fall, this oversight activity may intensify.

Online censorship. The House Judiciary Committee is continuing its years-long investigation regarding censorship of conservative voices online. As part of the Committee’s investigation into the impact of foreign laws on free speech in the United States, on February 26, 2025, the Committee sent subpoenas to eight tech companies seeking communications with foreign governments regarding compliance with foreign censorship laws, regulations, and judicial orders. On July 25, 2025, the Committee issued its latest censorship report, titled “The Foreign Censorship Threat: How the European Union’s Digital Services Act Compels Global Censorship and Infringes on American Free Speech.”

China. China remains an area of bipartisan interest with members on both sides of the aisle focused on issues such as export controls, tariffs, bulk data transfers, and semiconductor and chip manufacturing. For example, on July 25, 2025, Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI), House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security Chairman Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), and Rep. Keith Self (R-TX) sent a letter to several major U.S. technology companies probing whether the subsea cable systems that each company maintains contain components produced, maintained, or repaired by entities affiliated with China. Earlier this month, senators on both sides of the aisle sent letters raising concerns about U.S. chip manufacturers selling chips in China and links to the Chinese government.

On the Rise: Parallel Executive Branch and State Attorneys General Investigations

Fundraising platforms. On April 24, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum “to crack down on illegal ‘straw donor’ and foreign contributions in American elections, following reports and congressional investigations regarding potentially unlawful activities through ActBlue and other online fundraising platforms” and directing the Attorney General to investigate and take action as appropriate. On June 22, 2025, multiple House committees—including the Judiciary Committee, Oversight Committee, and Committee on House Administration—sent a series of letters and subpoenas that also target ActBlue for its fundraising activities.

President Biden’s cognitive capabilities. On June 4, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum “directing an investigation into who ran the United States while President Biden was in office.” The memorandum asserts that President Biden’s “repeated use of an autopen raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of his actions” and seeks to determine who, in fact, signed presidential documents during Biden’s tenure. That same day, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) issued letters to former Biden administration officials seeking to compel their testimony regarding “President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.” Both actions followed a May 22, 2025, announcement by Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Chair Ron Johnson (R-WI) stating that he sent letters to 28 former Biden cabinet members on the same topic.

Climate action. On August 1, 2025, a federal court in the Eastern District of Texas ruled that a group of Republican state attorneys general may proceed with a lawsuit that accuses three of the world’s largest investment companies of violating both state and federal antitrust laws based in part on their participation in climate initiatives. This lawsuit builds on inquiries initiated in 2022 by Republican state attorneys general, as well as a 2023-2024 House Judiciary investigation into the same three investment companies (as well as several other investment industry actors) regarding “the sufficiency of existing antitrust laws to address collusive agreements to promote and adopt progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.” The Committee released its report on December 13, 2024.

Shadow of the Future: Democratic Members Target Entities that Cut Deals with the Trump Administration

Big Law. On April 24, 2025, minority members on the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to nearly a dozen major law firms following reports that the firms had made deals with the Trump administration in response to or in anticipation of being targeted by Executive Orders challenging the legal practices and hiring decisions at various large U.S. law firms. The Democratic congressmembers sought information on the “enforceability of these agreements, how each agreement was formed, what promises were made, and how the agreements will be implemented.”

Paramount-Skydance. On May 19, 2025, several Democratic members of the House and Senate sent letters to the chair of Paramount Global (“Paramount”) about the company’s apparent attempt to settle the lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS, a Paramount subsidiary. The members expressed concern that Paramount was contemplating the settlement only because of the company’s announced plan to merge with Skydance Media—a merger that required the review and approval of the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC). On July 2, 2025, Paramount announced that it would pay $16 million to settle the CBS lawsuit with President Trump, and on August 7, 2025, the merger was completed. In response, Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) sent a letter to the FCC Chair on August 18, 2025, and ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee initiated an investigation into the Paramount-Skydance merger on August 21, 2025.

Pulitzer attorneys asked to shelve the dispute at least until Trump leaves office, pointing to a potential conflict should a state court seek to exercise authority over the nation’s chief executive. The case is in Florida because Trump and one of the board members live here.

A state trial Judge and the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal rejected that argument, ruling there was no need to delay adjudication of the case. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that Presidents are not immune from lawsuits while in office.

Trump filed the defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer board, the group that decides who wins Pulitzer prizes, after it bestowed a joint award in 2018 to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their reporting on alleged Russian interference in Trump’s first election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that his investigation uncovered insufficient evidence of collusion between the Russians and Trump’s campaign, “despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Mueller left unresolved whether Trump committed obstruction of justice.

The Pulitzer board argued that halting the case would avoid constitutional conflicts that could arise from Trump serving as plaintiff in a case that could involve official acts as President. Trump argued the case should carry on. Both courts sided with Trump.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4c4d3cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5166x2906+0+273/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F44%2F79%2F0f2485217376ef07aa0bbc698ff0%2F2f3d4a8ef2b749b3adddc2c099a23b68,N,,2025-08-27 18:58:00.530735

Judge Lynn Adelman of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin denied Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan’s motion to dismiss a federal indictment. The indictment charges Dugan under 18 U.S.C. § 1071 with concealing a person from arrest and under 18 U.S.C. § 1505 with obstructing removal proceedings conducted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Federal prosecutors allege that in April 2025, Dugan confronted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside her courtroom, told them they needed a judicial warrant to arrest a noncitizen defendant, and directed them to leave the area. According to the indictment, she later allowed the individual and his attorney to exit through a non-public jury door, advising that he could appear remotely at his next court date.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that the alleged conduct constituted official judicial acts shielded by absolute immunity, that the prosecution violated the Tenth Amendment by intruding on state court authority, and that the statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional conflicts. Judge Adelman rejected these arguments, ruling that while judges enjoy immunity from civil suits for damages, the Supreme Court has never recognized absolute judicial immunity from criminal liability. He emphasized that judicial acts may serve as the means of accomplishing an unlawful end, and that immunity does not bar prosecutions alleging corrupt intent.

The court further held that the Tenth Amendment and federalism claims required factual development inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss, and found no ambiguity in the federal charging statutes that would justify narrowing them under the constitutional avoidance doctrine.

Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia announced Wednesday that he is seeking asylum in the US, according to media reports.

The move comes in the wake of Abrego Garcia, 30, being detained Monday by immigration officials in the state of Maryland, after being released from a jail in Tennessee on Friday, where he is scheduled for a January 2027 trial in an alleged human smuggling case.

The Trump administration said it intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, claiming he is part of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang, an allegation that he denies.

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to his home country of El Salvador in March during a nationwide immigration crackdown conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, which targeted alleged MS-13 and Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members.

Under a 2019 court order in a separate case, Abrego Garcia was prohibited from being deported to El Salvador due to threats of violence against him by gang members. The order, however, allowed deportation to a different country, which places him in his current situation to be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers are fighting those deportation efforts, arguing he faces persecution and torture in Uganda, which has documented human rights violations.

Abrego Garcia filed a Notice of Fear of Removal to Uganda to the court in which he stated his concerns.

""I, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia … hereby state that I fear persecution in UGANDA on account of my race, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group,"" he said. ""I also fear torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official in that country ... (and) that country will (re-deport me) to EL SALVADOR, where I also fear persecution on account of the above-mentioned protected grounds and torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official, and where I have been tortured in the past.""

US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the US cannot deport Abrego Garcia before she decides the underlying case. She also ruled that he must remain within a 200-mile (320-kilometer) radius of the Maryland court while he is in ICE custody.

Xinis scheduled an Oct. 6 hearing for the lawsuit that Abrego Garcia's attorneys filed Monday to challenge his deportation.

She is overseeing Abrego Garcia's case to ensure he can exercise his constitutionally protected rights during a process that his lawyers said should include immigration court proceedings and appeals. Xinis will not rule on whether Abrego Garcia receives asylum or is deported.

Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said the government will comply with the order, even though he disagrees with the court's decision not to remove Abrego Garcia while the lawsuit is pending.

The SUVs were in small business parking lots and dotted along rural highways. By day’s end, the immigration enforcement raids had begun. More than 70 people were arrested and taken into Border Patrol custody.

In Kern County, immigration enforcement is typically handled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Even then, arrests are usually targeted at specific individuals. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on the other hand, rarely operates outside its 100-mile zone near the U.S.–Mexico border. Kern County is almost 300 miles away from that area. But on January 7th, Border Patrol agents cast a far wider net. They didn’t go after individual people. Instead, they stopped people of color, especially those who agents believed were farmworkers. Their tactics were aggressive and unprecedented.

For many, the raid — dubbed “Operation Return to Sender” — felt like more than a one-time sweep. It marked the start of a troubling new chapter in immigration enforcement.

“This Was Racial Profiling at Its Most Basic Level”

For Bree Bernwanger, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the morning of January 7th started just like any other: then the calls began. Reports flooded in from Kern County that immigration agents were spotted in strange places throughout the county.

“They were slashing tires, smashing car windows,” Bernwanger recalls. “They pulled over cars, they grabbed people in parking lots, and there really didn’t seem to have any reason to do it except that people were brown. This was racial profiling at its most basic level.”

At first, everyone assumed these agents were ICE officers. But late one night, as Bernwanger checked the government’s detainee locator, she saw something unexpected. The people that had been arrested during the raid were in CBP custody. Border Patrol, which typically operates near the U.S.-Mexico border, had driven 300 miles into the Central Valley for a massive raid.

Agents targeted predominantly Latine neighborhoods and worksites, detaining people indiscriminately. People abducted were taken to a makeshift processing site in Bakersfield, then bused to an “icebox” in El Centro — freezing, windowless rooms with no beds, limited food, and no access to lawyers. Border Patrol coerced many into signing “voluntary departure” forms, misleading them about the consequences, which could include a 10-year ban on reentry.

Roughly 40 people were summarily expelled to Mexico without a hearing. Others, including U.S. citizens and longtime green card holders, were released but left shaken. Families and communities now live with the aftermath — fear, separation, and the knowledge that, as Bernwanger put it: “Everyone subjected to it is now picking up the pieces.”

“These folks’ rights are being violated. This should be concerning for all of us.”

Maricela Sanchez, an investigator with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, has lived her whole life advocating for our liberties and investigating civil rights abuses in the Central Valley. But on the morning of Operation Return to Sender, her social media feed showed something she’d never seen before: Border Patrol vehicles cruising down Highway 99 in Bakersfield.

“I haven’t seen that happen ever,” she recalls.

Through the Kern County Rapid Response Network — a coalition with a hotline and volunteers trained to document enforcement actions — and other partners, Sanchez helped interview dozens of people caught in the raids. Border Patrol foricibly reached into someone’s pocket to grab their ID from them. Another woman was driving home from work when she was pulled over by unmarked agents who never identified themselves. The next day, she was across the border in Mexico, separated from everything she had built in Bakersfield.

The stories Sanchez heard stayed with her: “Whenever I think about that week, I just think about how scary it was, how terrorizing it was. Just how much it affected our community.”

For Sanchez, these stories weren’t just case notes. They were the lives of her neighbors and friends. “So many children just stopped showing up to school. A lot of people didn’t feel comfortable coming to work. Folks completely stopped going to the store. How could that not impact you as a community member? Everyone should be concerned about this.”

“They thought no one would push back. But we did — and we’re not going anywhere.”

In Bakersfield, Rosa Lopez had been preparing for something like this for years. As a senior policy advocate with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, she’d helped build the Kern County Rapid Response Network during the first Trump administration.

When the first calls came in on January 7, Lopez didn’t hesitate. She and her team dispatched volunteers across the county to record what they saw: license plates, uniforms, the way stops were conducted. Reports came in of canines, weapons drawn, and officers breaking windows — a level of aggression she’d never seen before.

This raid wasn’t routine. Border Patrol had set up a tent office, busing people straight to the border without legal access. Later, Lopez learned the raid had never been approved by the Department of Homeland Security. It was a rogue operation carried out by agents who thought they could act with impunity.

But the community was ready. Years of organizing meant people knew their rights, had red “Know Your Rights” cards in their pockets, and were willing to speak out. Lopez watched neighbors and community members step forward not just to report what they’d seen, but to stand beside those targeted, offering food, rides, and moral support.

“This is a moment that is going to test all of us,” Lopez said. “You can be afraid and hide, or you can be afraid and still stand up. We chose to stand up.”

The Stakes Beyond Kern County

The ACLU, United Farm Workers, and Bakersfield residents took Border Patrol to court for its unlawful and discriminatory actions during Operation Return to Sender. Agents operated far outside their legal jurisdiction, targeted people based on race, and denied them basic due process — all in violation of the Constitution. In April, in a major win for civil rights, a federal district court in California blocked the U.S. Border Patrol from using stop-and-arrest practices, which has led to zero warrantless arrest since the decision.

The ACLU and our partners will keep fighting in court and pushing for reforms that protect immigrant communities from racial profiling and abuse. We’ll also continue to work alongside residents, organizers, and labor groups to ensure no one has to live in fear of unlawful raids. We know this fight is about more than one county in California — it’s about defending the rights and dignity of people across the country.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/08/kern-county-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 14:57:01.427491

Allison Bustillo, now 20, said she is being forced to leave, alone.

Bustillo decided on Tuesday in court to withdraw her asylum case and self-deport back to Honduras.

Bustillo graduated as an academic scholar from Crest High School two years ago.

“I am going to ask for mercy,” Bustillo said.

Channel 9’s sister station, Telemundo Charlotte, spoke with Bustillo exclusively last weekend from the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia where she’s been held since late February.

ICE agents arrested Bustillo in her east Charlotte apartment where she lived with her mother and three brothers, one of whom has autism.

Channel 9 couldn’t find a criminal record for Bustillo.

She told Telemundo she is a nursing student on scholarship at Gardner-Webb University.

“I’m not a criminal,” Bustillo said. “I literally came here when I was 8 years old to look for a better life, and this is how they are treating me.”

Bustillo’s mother, Kelly Chinchilla, said her daughter was desperate after being imprisoned for more than six months.

“We have fought all this time so that she could be released and return home, but as a mother, I also understand her, because she is at a point where she is desperate,” Chinchilla said.

Bustillo’s attorney, Martin Rosenbluth, was able to get her a voluntary departure despite not qualifying for it.

“Technically, under the law, she wasn’t eligible,” said Rosenbluth.

That means she will leave the country without a deportation order.

Her mother said that’s not justice and her daughter going to Honduras would be terrifying.

“The only memory my daughter has of Honduras is when someone put a gun to our heads,” the mother said.

Telemundo said Bustillo will now leave the country on a commercial flight.

Bustillo said ICE agents arrested her after officers came to her house looking for someone who wasn’t living there anymore.

The head of ICE has said agents will arrest anyone they find in the country who is undocumented even if they don’t have a criminal record.

The Homeland Security secretary said 1.6 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. in her first 200 days on the job.

In a speech at London Oxford Airport on Tuesday, Mr Farage said his party would be prepared to deport 600,000 migrants over five years if it won power at the next election.

But Calum Miller, MP for Bicester and Woodstock, said the proposals were ""empty slogans"" which were ""not a substitute for serious policy"".

In a letter to Farage, Miller added that Oxfordshire was a ""community interested in solving problems, not fuelling conflict"".

""You came here to talk about 'mass deportations' but made no effort to understand the people or challenges of this community,"" he wrote to the Reform UK leader.

""Instead of sowing division, we should build on that legacy.""

The BBC has contacted Reform UK and Nigel Farage for a response to Calum Miller's letter.

During Tuesday's speech, Farage said his party would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, under plans announced earlier.

The party says it would make £2bn available to offer payments or aid to countries like Afghanistan to take back migrants, with sanctions potentially imposed on uncooperative countries.

Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","Washington — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It's putting a spotlight on Trump's agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration's actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado's House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It's a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president's deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump's administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump's success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We've never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it's one of the most secure southern borders we've had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they're out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump's approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There's still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America's security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn't mean that we can't have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration's handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we'll see if now's the time.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/25/PDTN/85816129007-ap-25237406801430.jpg?crop=4677,2632,x0,y311&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-27 14:57:05.296749

Among those facing potential retaliation are staff who were directly responsible for relief efforts in Kerr county, Texas, which is still reeling from the deadly floods it faced last month, according to Stand Up for Science, the advocacy group that published the Monday letter.

“This situation is developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need,” said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson.

More than 180 current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.

Thirty-six signed their names while 141 signed anonymously for fear of retribution. Some reports say that up to 30 signatories have been placed on leave.

Though Stand Up for Science could not confirm that number, “it seems likely they’ve retaliated against all public signers”, a spokesperson said.

“Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the Fema 36,” the person added.

The Associated Press confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices on Tuesday evening informing them they would be placed on leave indefinitely, with pay, and that they must still check in every morning confirming their availability. The status of other signatories was unclear.

The notice said the decision “is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive”.

Fema did not respond immediately to questions about how many staff members received the notice and whether it was related to the letter.

The Washington Post first reported that some Fema employees were being put on leave.

Called the “Katrina Declaration” by signers, the letter references the much-criticized Fema response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf coast 20 years ago this week.

Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and the White House under Joe Biden’s presidency, who signed the letter, said the agency had been “completely unprepared for Katrina because of where they were positioned within the federal government at the time”.

He said the Trump administration was failing to comply with the 2006 Post Katrina Emergency Response Act (PKEMRA) passed to prevent future botched disaster responses.

“As an example, PKEMRA required Fema to be led by someone with disaster management experience. This administration failed that test,” he said. “It requires that the secretary of homeland security not reduce the capacity or ability of the agency. They failed that test. And it requires them to provide training and preparedness measures for state and local partners, and they’ve rolled back a lot of those trainings, or put them on pause.”

The dissent letter contained six “statements of opposition” to current policies at Fema, including an expenditure approval policy by which the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, must approve contracts exceeding $100,000, which the signatories said reduces Fema’s ability to perform its mission.

It also critiqued the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to reassign some Fema employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the failure to appoint a qualified Fema administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and the Fema workforce.

Edwards said the Trump administration could immediately appoint a new acting Fema administrator with more disaster management experience, and end new policies requiring Noem to sign off on agency spending.

But at least one anonymous current staffer was skeptical of the letter’s ability to deliver change.

“I appreciate where their heart is but not a lot of upside for folks who work here to sign on to something like that,” the anonymous staffer said.

In an email on Monday, a Fema spokesperson said: “It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.

“Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo, who have forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.”

The statement was “an insult to anyone working at Fema, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances”, said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson.

The letter follows reports that the Department of Homeland Security, Fema’s parent agency, has administered lie detector tests in response to leaks about how the agency is being run.

“There is a huge culture of fear and intimidation that the secretary of homeland security has imposed upon the agency, and that David Richardson [Fema’s acting administrator] is also imposing,” said Edwards.

He said he had known people who were “unceremoniously fired on the spot” after failing polygraph tests.

“They refute the results, mind you, and these aren’t legitimate exercises, but they were walked out of the building,” he said. “The fact that the people who signed on to this letter saw all that happening, knew that that very same thing could happen to them, and they still took the risk because they thought it was important to put their name on this thing, I think speaks to an immense amount of courage on behalf of these people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b0babd9f82754fc4d8b36f078ffd24857b777e/62_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe3dafd41c98a07594f7e264522aee2a",N,,2025-08-27 14:57:09.951239

John Shin immigrated to Utah on a visa with his father from South Korea when he was a child, according to his attorney Adam Crayk.

He went to elementary school, high school and college in the Beehive state, graduating from Utah State University, before going on to play on some of the biggest stages, including a stint with the Utah Symphony and Ballet West.

On Tuesday, Shin’s wife Danae Snow, an American citizen, told ABC4 News that she got a heartbreaking phone call from him on her birthday Wednesday, August 20.

“That morning he was texting me ‘happy birthday, I love you so much’ and then by that afternoon, I got the phone call ‘honey, I’ve been detained by ICE, I love you and the kids and they’re sending me to a detainment center,” Snow said behind tears. “I just thought, oh my gosh, I don’t know how this can happen.”

Snow described Shin as a charismatic, selfless person, who not only contributes to society in a big way, but also to her family.

“They say that there’s stepdads and then there’s dads who step up and he’s really the dad who stepped up and he’s loved my kids just as his own,” Snow said.

According to Crayk, ICE arrested Shin because of Shin’s impaired driving charge several years ago, while he was struggling with the death of his father.

“It looks like John back in 2019 was charged with a DUI, but ultimately resolved his case in 2020 with an impaired driver [charge],” Crayk said. “He has successfully completed all of his probation, completed treatment classes, everything he was ordered to do … everything was completed.”

Shin had his driver’s license reinstated and was able to drive on Utah roads again with insurance.

“The problem that you have though, is as someone who is coming to the United States and who doesn’t currently have proper documentation because when you get a DUI, DACA gets taken — immigration will not let you have DACA with a DUI,” Crayk said. “He becomes a priority, especially under the current administration — so, he was taken into ICE custody because he accepted and did an agreement in Tooele County for an impaired driver, which caused ICE to take him into custody.”

Crayk is aiming to get Shin out of the ICE detention center in Aurora, Colorado during Shin’s first court appearance next Tuesday.

The Maryland construction worker, 30, was detained Monday in Baltimore by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement after leaving a Tennessee jail on Friday. Administration officials have said he’s part of the dangerous MS-13 gang, an allegation Abrego Garcia denies.

The Salvadoran national’s lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts in court, arguing he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has also told immigration authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.

It’s the latest twist in a long and complicated legal saga under the administration’s hardline deportation policies.

As his deportation proceedings and a related lawsuit move forward, here’s what to know:

Why does the government want to deport him?

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. without documentation when he was 16. He settled in Maryland, worked construction, married and started a family.

A U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for deportation in 2019, but not to his native El Salvador where he faces credible threats of violence from local gangs.

The Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, in violation of the 2019 order. His American wife successfully sued to bring him back in June, and on his return he was charged with human trafficking in Tennessee — charges his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration is trying to deport him again — before his trial — saying he’s a danger to the community. Confidential plea negotiations in his criminal case have become an opportunity for mudslinging on both sides.

Lawyers: Uganda is punishment

After the Trump administration was forced to bring Abrego Garcia back in June, ICE officials vowed to deport him to a unnamed third country. Within minutes of his release from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday, ICE said he would be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia notified the U.S. government Saturday that he fears deportation to Uganda, where he believes he could be tortured. He said he also worries that Uganda will send him to El Salvador, where he said he’s been tortured before.

In a separate notice, he said he would prefer to be deported to Costa Rica.

The notices were included in the lawsuit filed Monday. It says the U.S. is punishing Abrego Garcia for successfully fighting his deportation to El Salvador, refusing to plead guilty to the smuggling charges and for seeking release from jail in Tennessee.

Meanwhile, opposition figures and others in Uganda have criticized the agreement with the U.S. to receive deported migrants, questioning the lack of parliamentary approval and saying the deal eases political pressure on the country’s authoritarian president.

Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s national assembly.

He said Uganda is already struggling to look after refugees fleeing violence in neighboring countries. It’s unclear what Ugandan authorities are getting in return for accepting deportees.

Costa Rica and plea negotiations

The idea to deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica was borne of weekslong negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys in his human smuggling case.

Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying it was filed to punish him for challenging his deportation. Trial is set for January.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee. There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him. While officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling, he was allowed to drive away with only a warning.

A Homeland Security agent testified that he didn’t begin investigating until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys began confidential discussions about a possible plea agreement in mid-July, according to court filings. Abrego Garcia was only interested in a deal in which “he is deported to a Spanish-speaking third country in North or Central America — like Mexico — where he can live freely and safely” after serving his sentence in the U.S.

Working with the State Department, the U.S. Attorney’s Office was able to secure a pledge from Costa Rica that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed there as a legal immigrant and not detained or re-deported to El Salvador. Prosecutors believed the two sides were very close to an agreement last week.

But within minutes of Abrego Garcia leaving jail on Friday, ICE informed his attorneys that it intended to deport him to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys publicized details of the plea negotiations in a Saturday court filing. They said the threat of deportation to Uganda was more proof of the vindictive nature of the criminal case and more reason to dismiss it.

Prosecutors shot back on Monday, defending their handling of the plea discussions and accusing defense attorneys of “twisting the Government’s good-faith efforts into something sinister.”

Reasonable fear interview

In his lawsuit, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court to ensure that he can exercise his constitutional rights, including immigration court proceedings and appeals.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, told reporters Monday that he is entitled to a reasonable fear interview, when he can express fears of persecution or torture in Uganda.

If officials determine Abrego Garcia lacks reasonable fear, he should be allowed to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, his lawyer said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

The Trump administration could just send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, which already said it would accept him, the lawsuit said. But the administration chose Uganda “to punish him.”

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it's police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients' rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn't necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient's privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what's wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in 'precarious' situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”

“The Supreme Court should see through that ruse.”","The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court for the second time to allow the government to freeze, for now, billions of dollars in foreign aid.

In an emergency request, the administration asked the justices to lift an order from a federal judge that requires the administration to spend funds Congress already budgeted for foreign aid.

The administration has moved aggressively to seize control of the executive branch and claimed broad authority to halt federal dollars appropriated by Congress for programs at odds with President Trump’s agenda.

The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has generally been receptive to the administration’s claims, handing the president a series of technically temporary victories that have nevertheless had broad practical consequences. In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

But in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case in March, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

Lower court judges have issued a series of conflicting rulings as to whether Mr. Trump can refuse to spend the funds.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, both nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s power of the purse.

Judge Amir Ali of the Federal District Court in Washington said in March that the administration had unlawfully delayed the money and required the administration to allow funds to flow, including nearly $4 million for global health and more than $6 million for H.I.V. and AIDS programs.

Then, earlier this month, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Mr. Trump, finding that the global health organizations that challenged the freeze lacked grounds to bring the lawsuit. In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court said that only the Government Accountability Office, an independent watchdog controlled by Congress, could challenge the administration’s withholding of funds.

Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the office can sue to force the release of funds a president refuses to spend. But it has not yet taken that step.

A larger complement of judges on the D.C. Circuit then refused to allow the three-judge panel ruling to immediately take effect while the full 10-member appeals court decided whether to rehear the matter. (One judge has recused herself.)

That prompted Solicitor General D. John Sauer to race to the Supreme Court this week, telling the justices that lawmakers and the president — not a single federal judge in Washington — should resolve disputes over how or whether to disperse federal funds appropriated by Congress.

“Given the vast sums involved and the significance of the case to the separation of powers and U.S. foreign policy, the district court’s holdings, if allowed to stand, would clearly warrant this court’s attention, and those holdings would not survive review,” Mr. Sauer wrote, asking the justices for a decision by Sept. 2.

The district court’s ruling, he added, “would open the floodgates to suits by private parties who compete for appropriated funds and who seek to impose judicial oversight on executive spending decisions at odds with the process Congress prescribed.”

In response, the lead lawyer for the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition noted that the administration had waited months before asking the justices to block the lower court’s ruling.

“Now they are running to the Supreme Court, claiming at the last second that they would be harmed by compliance with the district court’s order,” Lauren Bateman, a lawyer at Public Citizen Litigation Group, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court should see through that ruse.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/27/multimedia/27dc-scotus-usaid-mfpk/27dc-scotus-usaid-mfpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:03.936284

As lawmakers prepare to return next week from their August recess, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) wants them to get to work on immigration reform and bolstering federal safety net programs, among other issues, framing its advocacy work around protecting human dignity and supporting the most vulnerable.

“As a nonpartisan organization, the USCCB is engaged with members of Congress, their staff, and the White House and the administration to advance the common good for all and uphold the sacredness of human life and the God-given dignity of the human person,” Chieko Noguchi, the USCCB’s executive director for public affairs, told CNA.

“This means that the care for immigrants, refugees, and the poor is part of the same teaching of the Church that requires us to protect the most vulnerable among us, especially unborn children, the elderly, and the infirm,” Noguchi noted.

Addressing the conference’s ongoing public policy priorities, Noguchi referenced a letter to members of Congress earlier this year from USCCB President Archbishop Timothy Broglio that in addition to immigration reform called for legislation that supports vulnerable communities, especially children and low-income families.

But following this summer’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending package, Broglio faulted that measure for including “unconscionable cuts to health care and food assistance, tax cuts that increase inequality, immigration provisions that harm families and children, and cuts to programs that protect God’s creation.”

A recently emerging issue for the bishops is digital safety. In a joint letter this July with other faith-based and family organizations, the USCCB voiced support for the Kids Online Safety Act. The measure would place greater responsibility on technology companies to design platforms that protect minors from harmful content and addictive features. The bishops described the legislation as consistent with their commitment to safeguarding children and promoting environments where families can thrive.

This fall, immigration remains central to USCCB advocacy efforts. The bishops continue to press Congress to provide permanent protections for so-called “Dreamers,” referring to people who were brought to the U.S. as children.

“The continued uncertainty associated with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program is untenable and unjust, depriving hardworking people the ability to be fully recognized members of our society,” the conference maintains.

The bishops also oppose changes to social safety net programs that would limit eligibility for mixed-status families (those with both legal and unauthorized members). They cite, for example, the Child Tax Credit, which currently only requires the benefiting child to have a Social Security number.

“This is consistent with the goals of such programs, which exist to empower families and to prevent them from falling into poverty,” the USCCB asserts.

Religious Workforce Protection Act

The bishops are also urging passage of the Religious Workforce Protection Act, which as of Aug. 22 had 10 Democrat and three Republican lawmakers cosponsoring the House bill and would authorize the continuation of lawful nonimmigrant status for certain religious workers affected by the current backlog for religious worker immigrant visas.

A similar bill in the Senate now has five Republicans and one Democrat cosponsoring. Numerous Catholic institutions such as parishes and schools depend on international clergy. In an Aug. 7 interview with EWTN, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration is committed to fixing the ongoing backlog of religious worker visas.

Despite the fact that earlier this year the USCCB ended its decades-long partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees due to funding cuts and suspended agreements that made the program unsustainable, the bishops continue to call for generous resettlement policies and humane border enforcement.

Housing is also an increasing policy focus. In an Aug. 8 letter, the bishops pressed Congress to strengthen funding for affordable housing and community development in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations process.

(Story continues below)

Meanwhile, the USCCB’s advocacy around health care policy remains linked to the Church’s pro-life stance. The bishops have been strongly supportive of congressional efforts to ensure that federal programs such as Medicaid do not fund abortion. In July, a federal judge blocked a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood for one year and ordered the federal government to resume Medicaid reimbursements to the abortion giant while litigation over the law continues.

The USCCB also supports expanding access to maternal health services, pediatric care, and palliative care. Broadly on fiscal policy, the USCCB has called for a federal budget that prioritizes the poor and reflects Catholic principles of solidarity centered on the common good.

The bishops also continue to press for robust support for international humanitarian aid. As global crises intensify, the bishops have asked Congress to provide funding for humanitarian and development assistance in the fiscal year 2026 budget. Funding for the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The USCCB frames these legislative priorities as connected parts of a single mission.

“The decisions you make in your important work on behalf of our nation will have a lasting impact on the well-being and common good of many people,” Broglio wrote.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February.
Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.
She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.
Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law.","Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger says one of her first acts if elected would be to undo Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s February directive requiring Virginia law enforcement to help carry out federal immigration crackdowns — a policy she argues wastes local resources and undermines community trust.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February. The order gave state police and corrections officers authority to perform certain immigration duties and also urged local jails to fully cooperate with federal deportation operations.

The governor said at the time the measure was meant to keep “dangerous criminal illegal immigrants” off Virginia’s streets. Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.

“Our immigration system is absolutely broken,” she said. “The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources.”

Spanberger’s stance sets up a sharp contrast with her opponent — Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced the order and tied it to her own story as a legal immigrant from Jamaica.

The divide between the two candidates underscores how immigration has become one of the most combustible issues in Virginia’s 2025 campaign for governor — and how Youngkin’s policies continue to shape the race even as he prepares to leave office in January.

That influence stretches beyond Youngkin’s executive order. In late February, Youngkin also launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a sweeping federal-state operation staffed with more than 200 personnel from agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, state police and corrections, which has claimed hundreds to thousands of immigration and gang-related arrests in Virginia.

Keep enforcement federal, Spanberger says

Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in Congress before launching her gubernatorial bid, argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by federal officials with judicial oversight, not by local police diverted from their own duties.

She said Democrats are often wrongly portrayed as opposing law enforcement when they object to policies like Youngkin’s that conscript local agencies into immigration sweeps.

“If someone has a criminal violation at the state level or at the federal level … local resources are required to arrest that person or put them in a local jail before transferring them to federal custody. Absolutely the locality should participate in that,” she said.

But Spanberger insisted the standard should be the same for immigration cases as for any other criminal matter.

“They have to have a warrant to pick somebody up off the street, so they meet that same standard,” she said. “And they can easily go get that detention order signed by a judge or a magistrate, if they want that local support.”

Without those safeguards, Spanberger argued, local cooperation with ICE undermines community policing, creates constitutional concerns and strains already tight budgets. She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.

Earle-Sears emphasizes rule of law

Earle-Sears, who initially agreed to a similar policy interview with The Mercury but canceled minutes before it was to take place, has publicly and repeatedly defended Youngkin’s executive order.

“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the governor, attorney general, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said in February when announcing the policy. “Now, working with President Trump, we can take on the scourge of dangerous and violent illegal immigrants.”

In December, while unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal, she described the bureaucratic hurdles her own family went through when immigrating to the U.S. and argued that others should follow the same path.

“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States. Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state,” she said.

“The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America,” she added.

Earle-Sears’ broader ideas on immigration remain unclear, as she has not gone beyond a handful of public statements and her campaign website offers no issue page outlining her positions.

Dispute over Youngkin’s deportation claims

The candidates also diverge sharply on Youngkin’s claim in July that all 2,500 immigrants arrested and deported by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force are “violent criminals.”

Spanberger said she has seen no evidence to support the governor’s sweeping assertion.

“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed, in which case, there would be clear documentation,” she said. “Frankly, as somebody who believes in upholding the law, I want people to be arrested for the crimes that they are committing.”

Civil rights groups have also raised alarms, arguing that Youngkin’s mandate is “playing politics with people’s lives.”

“For years, Virginia’s governor has been pushing the same dangerous, false narrative as the Trump administration that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than people who were born here, despite the fact that no data exists to support that conclusion,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said in a statement.

Earle-Sears has not directly addressed the governor’s 2,500 figure but has frequently pointed to grim cases of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in arguing for tougher enforcement.

“We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this executive order will make sure we send them back to where they came from,” she said earlier this year.

The Laken Riley Act

The immigration debate has also touched on Spanberger’s record in Congress.

Earle-Sears has faulted her for initially voting against the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia college student killed by a Venezuelan national who entered the country unlawfully. The law, which eventually passed after Spanberger left Congress, requires federal authorities to detain immigrants accused of theft and burglary while their cases proceed.

Spanberger said she opposed the bill in its first iteration because it “was essentially putting incredible burdens on localities removing any form of due process” and would not have prevented Riley’s murder.

“As a mother of three daughters, I was deeply offended that they would utilize that young woman’s murder as a political talking point,” she said. “At the time of that vote, her father was in the press saying that he was deeply distressed by the fact that her murder was being utilized in the way that it was.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Spanberger has staked out a position that balances criticism of Trump-era immigration policies with support for reforms viewed as moderate.

“Spanberger has been fairly vocal in criticizing the Trump administration’s methods of dealing with undocumented immigration,” Richards said.

“Her voting record on bills centered around immigration has been mixed, supporting some of the more moderate bills, but voting ‘no’ on some key GOP bills like the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act. … It falls in line with her presenting herself as a pragmatic candidate.”

By contrast, he said, Earle-Sears has been relatively quiet on immigration, surfacing the issue primarily when it intersects with her biography or when amplifying President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“She did talk about the issue back in June, saying that she, as an immigrant, did things the ‘right way.’ But overall, she has skirted the issue,” Richards said.

“She may feel that the issue is not one she can really win with in Virginia, although, as more immigration related arrests happen in the commonwealth, she may have to start talking about this.”

The bigger picture

The fight over immigration in Virginia is inseparable from national politics. Youngkin has aligned himself closely with Trump on enforcement strategies, boasting of joint operations with ICE and staging press events around courthouse raids and “gang and immigration sweeps” that have drawn criticism from Democrats and civil liberties groups.

Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law. She cited bipartisan bills like the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and the Dignity Act as examples of incremental progress, even if they fell short.

“There are many places where the governors of states can bang on the table and tell Congress, ‘Stop making this such a political issue that you campaign on every two years and just fix it,’” she said.

She added that immigration is not only a humanitarian concern but also a pressing economic issue for Virginia, from hospitals seeking visas for foreign-trained nurses to seafood producers dependent on seasonal guest workers.

Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has emphasized border security and public safety, drawing a bright line between legal immigrants like herself and those who arrive unlawfully.

“Any local elected official who instructs law enforcement to defy efforts to keep Virginians safe abandons their duty and breaks the trust of the people they swore to protect,” she said last year.

Looking ahead

With polls showing immigration remains a top concern among Republican voters — and a complicated one among independents — the issue is likely to stay at the forefront of this year’s election cycle.

Spanberger is betting Virginians will see Youngkin’s executive order as overreach that diverts local resources and harms public safety by discouraging immigrant communities from reporting crimes. Earle-Sears is counting on voters to view strict enforcement as common sense, framed by her own story of navigating the legal immigration system.

“Maybe she is waiting for a Trump endorsement,” Richards said of Earle-Sears. “But if immigration remains in the headlines, she may not be able to avoid it.”

For now, voters face a stark choice between a Democrat who vows to unwind the governor’s crackdown and press Congress for broader reforms, and a Republican who pledges to double down on enforcement in the name of law and order.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4799.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:11.866218

The Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) and the Office of the Governor told KING 5 they’ve cut off the federal government’s ability to search a state database filled with vehicle licensing information.

The move comes after the KING 5 Investigators provided proof that ICE has misused state data to arrest undocumented residents. In Washington that’s against the law. The Keep Washington Working Act prohibits this kind of collaboration between state departments and ICE. The 2019 law states the federal government may not use state data to arrest and deport undocumented residents.

“I'm very concerned because this is explicitly what the Department of Licensing said it wasn't doing. Now we see that it is,” said Angelina Godoy with UW’s Center for Human Rights.

On Monday, officials at DOL told KING 5 the reporters were wrong – that ICE was not using the state’s database for immigration enforcement.

“The Department of Licensing has determined (the state database) was not used in {this} case. As part of (our information system), we can audit all searches made within the system. We confirmed no search was made,” wrote a DOL spokesperson.

On Tuesday night, state leaders changed their position. Representatives from DOL and the Office of the Governor told KING 5 further investigation found ICE did run an undocumented resident's license plate to verify he was the registered owner. That confirmation led to the man’s arrest.

“The terms of the agreement are very clear, as are the penalties for not following them. Even one violation is enough. It’s that important,” said Nathan Olson, DOL communications director.

DOL said it immediately took action and terminated ICE’s account. Both DOL and Governor Bob Ferguson’s Office thanked KING 5 for bringing it to their attention. They plan to notify legislators and community advocates of this breach of trust.

Boyd attended a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) institution for several years and argued that the inclusion of NAIA time in the membership’s “five-year” rule violated the antitrust laws. Rejecting Boyd’s request, the court noted how the facts here differed from those in the Pavia case, which was decided by the same Tennessee federal court (and judge):

“The major differences are: (1) Boyd has exhausted both the four years of intercollegiate competition and the five-year period of eligibility, whereas Pavia had one year remaining on the eligibility clock; (2) Boyd challenges the ‘counting’ of his years of attendance and competition at Georgetown College, a four-year degree granting institution that is a member of the NAIA whereas Pavia challenged the ‘counting’ of his years of competition at New Mexico Military Academy, a two-year junior college from which he could not earn a four-year degree; (3) Boyd challenges the Bylaw allowing waiver of the time-limits to eligibility; Pavia did not challenge that Bylaw.” (at 11)

Also last week, a federal court in West Virginia granted several football student-athletes’ request for a preliminary injunction enjoining the application of the five-year rule to the plaintiff student-athletes who had previously attended junior college institutions.

The varying court decisions on eligibility rules add weight to calls for a legislative response. Relatedly, time flies, and it’s been over a month since President Trump’s Executive Order regarding college sports, which included a direction to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission that action be taken in connection with “Legal Protections for College Athletics from Lawsuits” within 60 days of the order. We’ll keep you posted.

Trump administration officials want him to admit he's committed crimes in the U.S., which he denies.

A whistleblower says the Social Security data of more than 300 million Americans was put at risk after Department of Government Efficiency workers uploaded sensitive information to a cloud account not subject to oversight.

And as armed National Guard troops patrol the nation’s capital, a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows handling crime is now a relative strength for Trump.

The Latest:

Abrego Garcia, who has become the face of Trump’s hardline immigration agenda, wants to seek asylum in the United States, his lawyers told a federal judge Wednesday.

The 30-year-old Salvadoran national was detained Monday in Baltimore by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement after leaving a Tennessee jail on Friday. Administration officials have said he’s part of the dangerous MS-13 gang, an allegation Abrego Garcia denies.

His lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts in court, arguing he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has also told immigration authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday that his department is taking management of Union Station, the main transportation hub in Washington, away from Amtrak.

Duffy said ahead of an appearance with Amtrak President Roger Harris at Union Station for the launch of the NextGen Acela, the rail service’s new high-speed train, that the building a short walk from the U.S. Capitol had “fallen into disrepair” when it should be a “point of pride.”

Duffy’s words echoed Trump, who said last week that he wants $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington as part of his crackdown on the city.

As armed National Guard troops patrol the nation’s capital in an unprecedented federal takeover of Washington, D.C.’s police department, handling crime is now a relative strength for Trump, the poll found.

Americans are generally not happy about the Republican president’s handling of issues like immigration and the economy but are more positive about his tough-on-crime approach, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Indeed, the vast majority of Americans — 81% — see crime as a “major problem” in U.S. cities — a concern Trump seizes on with threats to expand National Guard deployments to cities across the country.

But the poll shows less public support for federal takeovers of local police departments, suggesting that opinions could shift, depending on how aggressively Trump pursues his threats.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service responded to a request for comment by saying it believes that “particularly in the current situation, Greenland is a target for influence campaigns of various kinds” that could aim to create divisions in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.

It said it “assesses that this could be done by exploiting existing or fabricated disagreements, for example in connection with well-known individual cases, or by promoting or amplifying certain viewpoints in Greenland regarding the Kingdom, the United States, or other countries with a particular interest in Greenland.”

The service, known by its Danish acronym PET, said that in recent years it has “continuously strengthened” its efforts and presence in Greenland in cooperation with authorities there, and will continue to do so.

“We are aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement emailed Wednesday by his ministry. “It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the Kingdom in the time ahead.”

“Any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom will of course be unacceptable,” Løkke Rasmussen said. “In that light, I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the U.S. chargé d’affaires for a meeting at the Ministry.”

Cooperation between the governments of Denmark and Greenland “is close and based on mutual trust,” he added.

This isn’t the first time Danish leaders summoned the top U.S. diplomat for an explanation about alleged spying in Greenland. They did it in May, after the Wall Street Journal reported that high-ranking officials under Trump’s intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard had directed intelligence agency heads to learn more about Greenland’s independence movement and sentiment about U.S. resource extraction there.

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen spoke with The Associated Press the next day, saying “you cannot spy against an ally.” The embassy declined to comment on the summoning of Jennifer Hall Godfrey, acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen.

Danish public broadcaster DR reported that government and security sources, which it didn’t name, believe that at least three Americans with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in the territory.

One of those people allegedly compiled a list of U.S.-friendly Greenlanders, collected names of people opposed to Trump and got locals to point out cases that could be used to cast Denmark in a bad light in American media. Two others have tried to nurture contacts with politicians, businesspeople and locals, according to the report.

DR cited eight sources, who believe the goal is to weaken relations with Denmark from within Greenlandic society. DR said it had been unable to clarify whether the Americans were working on someone’s orders. The Associated Press could not independently confirm the report.

At 12:30 p.m. Eastern, the president is scheduled to have lunch with Vice President JD Vance at the White House.

That event, the only on his public schedule today, is closed to the press.

Some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday evening, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter sent to the FEMA Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.

The Associated Press has confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices Tuesday evening informing them they would be placed on leave indefinitely, with pay, and that they must still check in every morning confirming their availability. It was unclear what the status was for other signatories.

Minneapolis student detained by ICE, deemed flight risk

What we know:

Lucero was detained while driving a car with several others inside, his attorney, Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, tells FOX 9.

She said he did not appear to be the target, but was likely detained because he is not a U.S. citizen.

An immigration court judge denied his bond on the grounds that he is a flight risk because he does not have any relatives in the country who are here legally.

The decision means he will remain in custody at the Sherburne County Jail until his next court appearance, which could be months away, she said.

The backstory:

Lucero immigrated to the United States from Ecuador in 2020 when he was 14, Dhawan-Maloney said. She noted that he had applied for asylum, which is pending, and has a work permit, both of which she said allow him to stay in the country.

He is a student at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, where he studies international business on a full scholarship.

Demonstrators spread out around the building's perimeter to monitor each exit. They were there in hopes of slowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ongoing efforts to detain migrants.

ICE has a field office in Eugene's federal building, and local immigration advocate say people have been being detained during regular check-ins.

""My friends and also family members have decided not to show up to their appointments because of being detained,"" said protestor Marbella Vasquez. ""Let it be known that we want ICE out of here—out of Lane County, out of Eugene, out of Oregon, everywhere.""

Just before 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, as protesters stood near the parking lot gates, a Department of Homeland Security vehicle began trying to exit to the street. Demonstrators initially refused to move.

A group of DHS officers then approached the crowd and told them to back up, before pushing some of them out of the way. KLCC captured that encounter on video.

Note: The video contains explicit language.

Less than an hour later, a law enforcement officer tried to exit the building in an unmarked car. Protestors demanded that person confirm whether there was anyone detained in the back seat, before letting the car proceed.

Rob Fisette, an organizer with the Lane County Immigrant Defense Network, said there's a back-and-forth between ICE and protestors, with each group adjusting their strategies week-after-week.

“When we're out here demonstrating, and we lose for the day, what that means generally, is that they take someone [into] the building and they kidnap them and they take them to Tacoma,"" said Fisette. ""And that's really visceral.""

Tacoma is home to a regional detention facility operated by ICE.

But Fisette said the the success of these protests is something that's harder to spot—the detainments that aren't happening.

""The real change is when ICE has to think harder about whether it's worth the trouble to try to detain people today,"" said Fisette. ""That's a larger benefit that we're bringing to the community.""

The number of ICE detentions in Eugene dropped sharply in July, after spiking the previous month, according to statistics cited by Lookout Eugene-Springfield.

Fisette said activists plan to be at the federal building the last Tuesday of every month, and whenever they receive word about a person facing deportation.

Monday's open letter to Congress — known as the ""Katrina Declaration"" — said it was signed by 191 current and former FEMA employees. Some 35 attached their names, while the rest said they withheld them over fear of retaliation.

Some of the current FEMA employees who used their names received emails on Tuesday night saying they had been placed on paid administrative leave ""effective immediately, and continuing until further notice,"" according to copies of the emails reviewed by CBS News.

""While on administrative leave, you will be in a non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits,"" the letter read. The staffers were told not to visit FEMA facilities, access the department's telecommunication systems or carry out any of their official duties, aside from responding to inquiries from the Department of Homeland Security.

The agency also told staff that they must remain available to work during business hours.

The emails did not provide a reason for the decision. Staffers were told the move ""is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.""

In a statement, FEMA called the signatories ""the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency"" and accused them of having ""forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.""

""Our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,"" FEMA continued. ""Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, FEMA will return to its mission of assisting Americans at their most vulnerable.""

The Washington Post was first to report on the suspensions.

The ""Katrina Declaration"" was published as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The 2005 hurricane prompted major changes to the nation's disaster relief system — and Monday's letter argued many of those reforms could be reversed by the Trump administration.

The letter accuses President Trump of picking unqualified people to lead FEMA, and criticizes the administration for cutting the agency's workforce and terminating grants meant to help state and local governments harden their infrastructure to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

The declaration said it hopes changes are made in time to ""prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

The Trump administration has pushed for sweeping changes to FEMA. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested either ""getting rid of FEMA"" or ""fundamentally reforming"" the agency by pushing some of its duties to state governments. So far this year, the agency has lost roughly one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and voluntary departures.

FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues responded to the letter Monday by defending the Trump administration's record of handling natural disasters and arguing FEMA was previously ""bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes.""

""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said. ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.""

“[Don’t] get distracted by these calls for a new census before the one that the law and the Constitution requires in 2030 because that proposal is neither feasible nor wise,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former Capitol Hill staffer and census expert, during a virtual briefing Tuesday that was hosted by the nonprofit the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “We need to keep our eyes on the nation’s prize and that’s a successful 2030 census that counts all communities equally well. The Census Bureau needs the next four years to get that done.”

Lowenthal warned that there’s been “radio silence” from the Census Bureau since the Trump’s administration’s return regarding a test scheduled for 2026 that will, in part, evaluate mailing and messaging strategies. She also said that community outreach and promotion for the test should have started this summer, but it’s unclear if the agency has done that due to a lack of public briefings and the elimination of its advisory committees.

“My census antennas are up, and I’m a bit worried about what we might see,” she said.

The experts also said how Congress resolves the Sept. 30 deadline to pass new government funding could impact 2030 Census planning. Steve Jost — a consultant for the Census Project, a network of organizations that rely on census data — cautioned that if lawmakers pass a long-term continuing resolution that funds agencies at their current levels, then that could hurt preparations.

“If it's a full-year CR, there are serious consequences to the planning for the 2030 operations,” he said. “We don't want to repeat what we had in the 2020 census when funding levels were delayed, frozen, CR-level flat lines, and that caused the Census Bureau to cancel their field tests and their dress rehearsals, which probably helped lead to some of those undercounts because the Census Bureau couldn't fully test its operations.”

The agency found that in 2020 it undercounted people who are Black, American Indian or Alaska Native living on a reservation, Hispanic or Latino or reported being another race.

Advocates who spoke during Tuesday’s briefing also expect that the Census Bureau will have more difficulties in getting the public to respond due to mistrust. Jost highlighted the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to and use of individuals’ government data as a possible source of distrust. Multiple speakers warned that ongoing attempts to ask about citizenship on the census, which Trump unsuccessfully tried to do during his first term, would lead to fewer people participating.

“Even though there was no citizenship question on the 2020 questionnaire, the debate around it raised significant doubts that we saw a significant decline in response rates among immigrant households and households with immigrant and mixed-status families,” said Arturo Vargas, who was the chair of the 2030 Census Advisory Committee before it was axed. “This contributed to a dramatic national undercount of the U.S. population. So continuing this conversation into 2030 will only solidify that wound in the Census Bureau's reputation and undermine its ability to be a credible agency to the public.”",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/08/26/082625_Getty_GovExec_Census/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 11:56:35.128464

The administration’s remarks against judges led one of Trump’s own judicial appointees to speak out in a published opinion on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen noted that in recent months, executive officials and their spokespeople “have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,’ ‘[c]rooked,’ and worse.”

Cullen, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench in Virginia during his first term, acknowledged that there has always been “some tension” between the branches of government.

But he wrote that “this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

The rebuke came in a footnote to his opinion rejecting an unusual lawsuit from the administration, which it filed against federal judges in Maryland for issuing orders preventing immigration officials from immediately deporting people who file habeas corpus petitions challenging their confinement.

Cullen’s ruling comes amid the administration’s latest attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally sent to El Salvador in March.

“Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,” Cullen wrote in dismissing the case, adding: “Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.”

Cullen’s ruling comes amid the administration’s latest attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally sent to El Salvador in March and only returned him to the U.S. in June after resisting court orders to do so. His latest litigation is now playing out in Maryland.

Notably, Cullen cited the Abrego case in his ruling Tuesday. Specifically, he cited an opinion from April by appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee who has likewise called out the administration’s actions.

But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.

“This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.","A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court bench in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.

When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.

Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”

But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 37-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right—express or implied — to litigate that grievance in this manner.”

“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.

Abrego Garcia detained by ICE; judge orders delay of deportation to Uganda

The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, the chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.

It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.

On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interefered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.

“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”

But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.

“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”

“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”

Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.

“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity … Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”

Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”

“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”

Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.

“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.

Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.

“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.

“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-2048x1720.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:24.909841

The failed attempt to dismiss the case means that Judge Hannah C. Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court remains on track to stand trial on federal charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings.

Judge Lynn Adelman, who was appointed to the Federal District Court by President Bill Clinton and who is presiding over Judge Dugan’s case, said the state judge had not shown that she should be exempted from the prosecution because of her role.

“There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job,’” Judge Adelman wrote.

Judge Dugan was little-known outside Milwaukee until April, when federal immigration agents showed up outside her courtroom with plans to arrest a man from Mexico who was scheduled to appear before her on domestic abuse charges. That set off a series of events that made Judge Dugan a face of the national immigration debate. Some supporters warned that her arrest amounted to an attack on the judiciary; Justice Department officials said it showed that no one was above the law.

Judge Dugan’s lawyers said in a statement on Tuesday that they were disappointed by the ruling. They added: “We look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

Justice Department officials declined to comment on Tuesday. A hearing in Judge Dugan’s case is scheduled for next week.

When the federal agents arrived at the county courthouse, they told security officers about their plans to arrest the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who is from Mexico, on an administrative warrant, according to an F.B.I. charging document. When Judge Dugan became aware of the federal agents, the charging document said, she became “visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor.”

According to the criminal complaint, the judge confronted the agents and told them to talk to the chief judge of the courthouse. She then returned to her courtroom and, according to the charging document, directed Mr. Flores-Ruiz through an alternate courtroom exit separate from the public door to the hallway where agents were waiting.

Mr. Flores-Ruiz made it outside the courthouse, the charging document said, where agents arrested him after chasing him on foot. Federal agents said that Mr. Flores-Ruiz was removed from the United States in 2013 and that there was no record of him seeking or receiving permission to return.

Days after Mr. Flores-Ruiz’s arrest, federal agents arrested Judge Dugan and top Justice Department officials weighed in on the case.

“It doesn’t matter what line of work you are in, if you break the law we will follow the facts and we will prosecute you,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

More than 150 former state and federal judges signed a letter to Ms. Bondi calling Judge Dugan’s arrest an attempt to intimidate the judiciary. And when the judge was in court pleading not guilty to the charges after being indicted by a grand jury, protesters gathered outside to urge prosecutors to drop the case.

Judge Dugan has been temporarily removed from the bench by the Wisconsin Supreme Court while the case against her moves forward.

Her arrest marked an escalation of the Trump administration’s warnings that local officials not impede federal efforts to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Since President Trump returned to office, the Justice Department has sued state and local governments that limit cooperation with immigration agents and has announced investigations of some elected Democrats over their immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/19/multimedia/00nat-wisconsin-motion-ruling-1-whtl/00nat-wisconsin-motion-ruling-1-whtl-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 09:56:19.465428

The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump' s administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.

She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She quickly filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.

However, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Tuesday rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.

Adelman said the dispute boils down to Dugan arguing that there is a general rule of immunity for judges from prosecution, with some limited exceptions, while the government argues that the cited exceptions are simply examples of types of prosecutions that have been brought.

""A review of the relevant history reveals the government has the better of the argument,"" Adelman wrote.

He said that ""the particulars of this case may be unusual,"" but ""there is no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered 'part of a judge's job.'""

Attorneys for Dugan said in a statement that they were disappointed with the judge's decision, but ""we look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.""

Steve Caballero, spokesman for prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's Milwaukee office, had no comment on the ruling.

Adelman's decision could be appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He scheduled a hearing in the case for Sept. 3.

Dugan has pleaded not guilty to helping a man in the country illegally try to evade authorities. No trial date has been set. She faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.

In a motion in May to dismiss the charges, Dugan argued that the federal government violated Wisconsin's sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.

Dugan also argued that the prosecution under federal law violated the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers because it overrides the state of Wisconsin's ability to administer its courts.

The judge rejected her arguments.

Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

Milwaukee police last week released body camera footage of Dugan saying she didn't know Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally. The comments were captured three days before her arrest after Dugan called police because of potentially threatening flyers she and family members had received.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly ""hid"" Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to say she didn't know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally, and she denied giving him special treatment.

""It's all lies,"" Dugan told officers. She later said, ""I didn't do anything that they're saying.""

Dugan's case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250515-hannah-dugan-mb-1541-976426.jpg",N,,2025-08-27 04:56:59.783893

We want to do something.” Klugman said with the conviction vacated, Dong can now petition the federal government to reopen his immigration case.","A judge on Tuesday vacated a decades-old conviction that was the basis for a San Diego man’s detention and looming deportation back to Vietnam, a country he has not returned to since he fled to the U.S. more than 40 years ago.

Chuong Dong’s friends and family – including his wife and children, who are all American citizens – filled the courtroom for the hearing, nearly two weeks after he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the annual check-in he’s been doing with the agency for more than 25 years. He’s been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center ever since.

“When he was taken, I was honestly just heartbroken,” his daughter’s friend Alana Nguyen said. “His case deserves so much attention because he's brought so much love and everything to the community that's gone very unseen.”

Dong came to the U.S. at the age of 12 as a refugee in 1981. He was abused at home and dropped out of school, eventually stealing two speakers at age 19. He took a deal, pleading guilty to robbery, speaking little English and not knowing it could impact his immigration status decades later.

On a later, lesser conviction, Dong spent time in prison, where his family said he turned his life around. Upon his release in 1999, he worked his way up to a role as an inspector of record on hospital construction projects across San Diego – helping several others who attended Tuesday’s hearing to do the same.

“Our job is to make sure that in the event of any catastrophe, earthquakes or anything, that the hospital is still standing,” said Trung Vo, who said Dong helped him enter the same inspecting role.

“He became my mentor — now he's a brother,” Vo continued. “He puts everyone else first. Without him guiding me, supporting me, I wouldn't be where I am now.”

Under a California law passed in 2017, Dong filed a motion earlier this month to vacate his 1989 conviction, arguing he was never informed of the effect his guilty plea would have on his immigration status.

“If a criminal defendant is unaware of the true consequences of their plea, that's a due process violation,” his attorney Adam Klugman said. “That plea cannot stand. Our justice system is based on fairness. It's based on due process. It's based on knowingly accepting consequences.”

As Dong was awaiting the hearing on that motion, he went to his yearly check-in with ICE on Aug. 13 and was detained, taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center, where he remains. His wife said one of her main concerns now is his health, because he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and has not been given his medication while in custody.

“I could see that he tried to hold his head up, because he doesn't want us to feel heartbroken,” his sister Sandy Huynh said about visiting him in detention, ""but I know deep down he's hurt because he's not with us.”

“Chung (sp) Dong is an illegal alien from Vietnam and a repeat felon who has racked up over five years in prison for various felonies to include robbery, multiple burglaries and grand theft,” ICE San Diego Field Director Patrick Divver said in a statement on Dong's detention, adding that the agency is “steadfast in its commitment to protecting the community by ensuring that dangerous criminals like Mr. Dong are removed.”

""I'm sure we all have our secrets,"" Vo said. ""All have skeletons in our closets. He's not that guy anymore. He’s a completely different man.""

""Whatever he did back then, he paid for his crime already,"" Huynh added.

The San Diego County District Attorney’s office did not oppose Dong’s 1989 plea being vacated, and on Tuesday, San Diego County Superior Court Judge Joan Weber reviewed the case and agreed.

“I did look over the transcript from the change of plea, and it appears that my retired colleague did not advise your client of the immigration consequences at all,” Weber said during the hearing.

“The defendant since this incident has been, at least by all accounts, a productive and upstanding and helpful member of society, so it would not be in the interest of justice to proceed with the case,” the deputy district attorney said in the hearing.

“He has not had any arrests or convictions since 1996,” Weber said in issuing her ruling. “The conviction we're now talking about is over 36 years old, and particularly when I see clearly that he was not properly advised at the time of the plea of the immigration consequences – this is an easy call.”

“He deserves that and he deserves more,” said Trinity Nguyen, another friend of Dong’s daughter. “He deserves to be out here with us right now. We don't know what to do. We've been grieving, but there's only so much grieving that we can do. We want to do something.”

Klugman said with the conviction vacated, Dong can now petition the federal government to reopen his immigration case.

“Justice prevailed today,” said Klugman. “Unfortunately, Mr. Dong's journey is not over. The next step now is to ask the federal government to reopen his case, do the right thing, cancel his deportation.”

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released the following statement on the arrest of an individual who threatened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Dallas, Texas.

On Monday, August 25, 2025, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) reported a bomb threat against an ICE facility in Dallas. An unknown male subject, later identified as Bratton Dean Wilkinson, a 36-year-old U.S. citizen, arrived at the reporting entrance of the Dallas Field Office and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at approximately 6:37 pm local time.

The subject showed the security officer what he claimed to be a “detonator” on his wrist. A shelter-in-place was issued for the facility. The officer called 911 and local police responded with a bomb squad.

“On Monday evening, law enforcement arrested a suspect who made bomb threats to a Dallas ICE facility. This incident comes just two weeks after a threatening letter with a white powdery substance was sent to an ICE office in New York City. Less than a week ago, a violent rioter was charged with assault in San Francisco after he threatened to stab an ICE officer and harm his family,” said a Senior DHS Official. “These incidents come after months of smears and rhetoric by activists, politicians, and the media comparing ICE law enforcement to the Nazi Gestapo, kidnappers, and the Secret Police. This shameful rhetoric has fueled a culture of hate against law enforcement resulting in a 1,000 percent increase in assaults against them. All sanctuary politicians, activists, and the media need to turn down their temperature.”

Wilkinson was taken into custody by local law enforcement and charged with making terroristic threats. At 7:19 pm local time, police issued an all-clear. The facility houses ICE’s Dallas Field Office as well as Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Every day, America’s brave ICE officers put their lives on the line to defend our homeland and keep Americans safe. Earlier this month, ICE responded to an emergency at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City involving a white powder which was found in ICE offices. Just days ago, DHS also arrested an individual in San Francisco who made repeated threats against law enforcement stating: “I’m going to fuck you up,” “I’m going to go after your family,” and “I’m going to stab you.”

Secretary Kristi Noem has been clear: Anyone who lays a hand on law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested by the administration.
Genevieve Sheriff Gary Stolzer, who oversees the detention center, did not respond to a request for comment on the possible use of the Missouri National Guard.
“To think that Kehoe thinks he needs the National Guard to come in and help, I don't know what he thinks they’re gonna do there,” said Sara Drost, Abide in Love-Ste.
Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state’s National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful.","Gov. Mike Kehoe is weighing a request from the Trump administration to deploy the state’s National Guard to support federal immigration enforcement in Missouri.

If the request is approved, Guard members would help handle administrative and logistical tasks for Immigration and Customs Enforcement — not make arrests — according to Kehoe’s spokesperson Gabby Picard.

A spokesperson for the Department of Defense said assistance could include case management, transportation and clerical support for the in and out processing of detainees without legal status.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested by the administration.

The request follows a July 25 order by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that brought members of military under the command of governors and authorized them to support immigration enforcement. That adjustment added 500 troops to help the immigration agency, bringing total Defense support to about 1,700 service members.

Picard said the extra support could affect 10 additional states, including Missouri. While federally funded, the Guard would remain under Kehoe’s authority.

“By providing these crucial services, DoD military personnel directly enable ICE to dedicate more trained agents to core law enforcement activities, significantly enhancing overall effectiveness,” said Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell in a statement. “The Department of Defense is committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security in its mission to maintain the security of our borders and enforce immigration laws.”

National Guard troops could be stationed at detention centers such as the jails in Springfield and Ste. Genevieve, which house federal detainees. The Phelps County Jail recently announced it would no longer hold detainees for ICE beginning on Sept. 1.

Volunteers working to support ICE detainees at the Ste. Genevieve County Jail said they are opposed to the potential deployment, adding it would contribute to the national rhetoric that people detained by ICE are criminals.

“In our experience, we have not found that,” said Susie Johnson, Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve’s treasurer. “These are people who have been going to their jobs, contributing to society.”

Ste. Genevieve Sheriff Gary Stolzer, who oversees the detention center, did not respond to a request for comment on the possible use of the Missouri National Guard.

“To think that Kehoe thinks he needs the National Guard to come in and help, I don't know what he thinks they’re gonna do there,” said Sara Drost, Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve’s president. “They don't need help containing them. It seems like an absolutely ridiculous request.”

As of Friday, 20 states — all with Republican governors — were either complying with ICE’s request for troops or considering it, according to Stars and Stripes.

Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state’s National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful. The Guard was ultimately not deployed.

""While other states may wait for chaos to ensue,"" the governor said at the time, ""the State of Missouri is taking a proactive approach in the event that assistance is needed to support local law enforcement in protecting our citizens and communities.""

The Guard deployment would mark the latest expansion of federal law enforcement’s presence in St. Louis.

Last week, U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Missouri, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced the FBI would be getting extra staffing to help fight violent crime in the region.

The deployment of the National Guard to help ICE across the U.S. is separate from President Donald Trump’s recent decision to send nearly 2,000 federal troops to address crime in Washington, D.C.

“However, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.”","A Los Angeles woman who was 9 months pregnant went into labor prematurely after she was wrongly arrested and assaulted by immigration agents, according to her attorneys.

Cary Lopez Alvarado, who is a U.S. citizen, was detained June 8 when she told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol agents that they needed a warrant upon their arrival at a private property in Hawthorne, a federal tort claim filed Aug. 20 on her behalf says.

Alvarado’s boyfriend and her cousin worked at the residence, where Alvarado was waiting for them at the property’s gate after her boyfriend told her over the phone that immigration authorities were following their truck, according to the legal claim.

Once her boyfriend and cousin arrived, the claim says federal agents pulled in behind their truck and tried to open it as Alvarado told them they needed a warrant.

Then, according to the claim, she was violently restrained and held in custody for several hours.

“The agents manhandled Ms. Alvarado by grabbing and pulling Ms. Alvarado’s arms, twisting her arm on the truck, and pushing her body, including her pregnant belly, onto the truck,” attorneys with the Carrillo Law Firm wrote in the filing.

“Border Patrol or ICE agents then shackled Ms. Alvarado with a chain under her pregnant belly, hands, and legs,” the claim states.

Footage the attorneys shared with McClatchy News shows Alvarado, who is visibly pregnant, being detained against a white truck.

“I didn’t want them to hurt my stomach because I had my baby there,” Alvarado said during an Aug. 20 news conference, KCAL reported.

Alvarado is one of five U.S. citizens who filed claims on Aug. 20 against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Customs and Border Protection over their arrests by immigration authorities in Southern California. A sixth claim was also filed on behalf of a legal U.S. resident. The claims are all being represented by the Carillo Law Firm.

Attorney Michael Carrillo said during the news conference that his clients “were racially profiled by ICE and border patrol agents in various communities in the Southland,” KCAL reported.

Since their arrests, the charges against them have been dismissed, according to the outlet.

In response to McClatchy News’ request for comment, a DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Aug. 26 that “what makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

The DHS spokesperson said “70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges.”

The spokesperson did not respond when McClatchy News asked why Alvarado was detained. In June, the agency told KTLA that she was arrested because she prevented agents from reaching “two Guatemalan illegal aliens” inside a car.

A DHS representative accused her of pushing an agent, according to KTLA.

In the claim, her attorneys argue that federal agents “had no evidence to charge Ms. Alvarado with a crime because she was not interfering with the arrests of others but was asking the agents to identify themselves and to provide a warrant.”

Alvarado is seeking $1 million in damages in connection with her arrest, which she says harmed her and her baby.

Her attorneys argue that DHS, ICE and CBP are liable for several federal violations, including false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, battery and racial profiling.

The other claimants represented by the Carillo Law Firm include U.S. citizens Angel Piña, Javier Ramirez, Andrea Velez and Juan Carlos Ramirez, as well as legal permanent resident Juan Rivas. They were arrested in June and July.

On Aug. 26, the firm announced it is representing another U.S. citizen, a 15-year-old boy with special needs who they said was wrongfully detained by ICE at Arleta High School in Los Angeles on Aug. 11. ICE agents are accused of holding the boy at gunpoint.

Man is jailed for days

ICE and Border Patrol agents did not have a warrant when they arrived at Javier Ramirez’s job at L.A. City Junk Cars in Montebello on June 12, racially profiled him, threw him to the ground and wrongly arrested him, according to his legal claim.

The claim says the agents, who were wearing masks, “immediately pointed at Mr. Ramirez and said ‘Get him, he’s Mexican.’”

Javier Ramirez told them he was a U.S. citizen who had a passport, but he was ultimately jailed for four days, from June 12 to June 16, on charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer.

Ramirez, a father of two, was born in San Bernandino, his family told KABC following his arrest. At the time, they expressed concern for his wellbeing, explaining he has diabetes and was taken into custody without his insulin.

The claim says his brother tried to give agents his medicine, but they “refused to take it.”

Like Alvarado, he is seeking $1 million in damages over his arrest and detainment, which left him with physical and emotional injuries.

The claims come after several lawmakers sent a letter to DHS on Aug. 8, demanding an investigation into reports of ICE detaining and deporting U.S. citizens, according to a news release from the office of Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10).

“ICE policy makes clear that, (a)s a matter of law, ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen,” the letter said. “However, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.”",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/rje1an/picture311857974/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Screenshot%202025-08-26%20142830.png,N,,2025-08-26 22:57:22.811808

A U.S. District judge on Tuesday rejected Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan’s request to dismiss allegations that she helped an undocumented immigrant evade federal authorities earlier this year.

Dugan was arrested in April after allegedly helping Eduardo Flores-Ruiz avoid plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who were trying to serve him a warrant.

Her attorneys argued she is entitled to judicial immunity for her official acts. They also said the federal government overstepped its authority by arresting and charging her.

The defense team also claimed the charges violate the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment and the principle of separation of powers.

FEDERAL CASE AGAINST MILWAUKEE JUDGE ACCUSED OF CONCEALING ILLEGAL MIGRANT SHOULD CONTINUE, JUDGE RECOMMENDS

Dugan’s attorneys further argued that Dugan can only be charged with conduct ""wholly unrelated"" to her judicial duties, such as taking bribes or violating constitutional rights, though she has not been accused of either in this case.

U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman ruled on the motion Tuesday.

""Ultimately, as the Supreme Court has stated, ‘the official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question,’"" Adelman wrote, adding that Dugan has not done so here. ""I cannot say as a matter of law that the defendant’s alleged conduct falls within even this more limited version of immunity.""

""There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job,’"" Adelman added.

Prosecutors allege that Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz and his attorney exit her courtroom through a back door on April 18, after learning that ICE agents were in the building to arrest him.

A federal indictment alleges Dugan ""falsely"" told the agents they needed a judicial warrant and directed them to go to the chief judge’s office. Dugan then addressed the case off the record instead of holding the scheduled hearing. Flores-Ruiz faces three misdemeanor battery charges, and despite Dugan’s efforts, he was arrested.

Adelman has scheduled a hearing about Dugan’s motion for Sept. 3.

In a Zoom call on Tuesday, Frontera Organizing Project coordinator Alan Lizarraga disclosed two cases illustrating the fear facing immigrant families on the border and how immigration enforcement is touching residents who aren’t undocumented migrants.

One case involved a resident driving home from work who was stopped by an unmarked pickup equipped with sirens. When an officer stepped down from the truck, the driver asked why he was being pulled over. The officer allegedly said, “You speak English?” turned around and left the scene.

Another documented case could be typical of the daily drama playing out at federal courthouses in border cities. A woman accompanied her husband to a routine immigration appointment only to see him taken into custody.

“I waited outside for him, and later he called me to let me know he was going to be detained,” the wife said in a statement shown by Lizarraga. “I asked if they had shown him a warrant; my husband handed the phone to one of the (agents) who said that under President Trump’s orders, he would have to continue his case in detention.”

Amid this environment, activists from the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo and West Texas are expected to join colleagues from El Paso and New Mexico to step up community organizing and know-your-rights education.

Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition Director Adriana Cadena said advocates also will be trying to dispel myths about immigrants leeching off public assistance. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or food stamps, yet the administration shaved billions off both of those programs implying they’re being abused by non-citizens, according to Cadena.

The result will be that eligible children will have less access to nutrition and health care particularly on the border where poverty rates are high, she said.",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/08/AP25162645397286.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-26 20:56:29.435049

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, also criticized the administration’s attacks on the judiciary, highlighting in a footnote that White House officials in recent months had described judges as “rogue,” “unhinged” and “crooked,” among other epithets.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he wrote.

The Trump administration filed a notice of appeal.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order by the chief judge of the Maryland district court that stopped the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. The Justice Department said the automatic pause impeded the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws, and it sought a court order blocking it.

Cullen said allowing the suit to continue “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

Unfavorable rulings for Trump

The lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed in June, was a remarkable legal maneuver, ratcheting up the Trump administration’s fight with the federal judiciary. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

“The Maryland court’s order upholds a direct assault on the President’s ability to enforce the immigration laws,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Tuesday. “This will not be the final say on the matter, and the Trump Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around. In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct complaint against that judge.

The Maryland judges, represented by prominent conservative lawyer Paul Clement, argued the administration’s lawsuit sought to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while it pursued a mass deportation agenda.

Among the judges named in the lawsuit was Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020, serves in the Western District of Virginia but was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges were named as defendants along with the court clerk and the court itself, a highly unusual circumstance he noted in his ruling.

“In casting its wide net, the Executive ensnared an entire judicial body — a vital part of this coordinate branch of government — and its principal officers in novel and potentially calamitous litigation,” he wrote.

Cullen found the administration lacked the legal authority to bring the suit, but he said even if it could, the judges were immune. Instead of the “more confrontational” approach of a lawsuit, the administration should have appealed the chief judge’s order, he wrote, calling that the “tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants.”

“One branch’s alleged infringement on another’s exclusive power does not license a constitutional free-for-all,” he wrote.

What the Maryland judge’s order said

Signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III, the order at issue in this case prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after the filing of their habeas corpus petitions, which allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.”

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Clement, who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush, denounced the suit during a hearing earlier this month.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” he said. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Federal Emergency Management Agency employees argue that sweeping funding cuts made by the Trump administration are affecting the agency's programs and missions as weather experts warn the next few months could see elevated hurricane activity.

Agency workers expressed their concerns in a letter to Congress on Monday ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on Aug. 29. The natural disaster which devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast resulted in Congress passing legislation that included the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act.

But FEMA contends in their letter, signed by more than 100 current and former workers, that efforts made by the Trump administration to shrink the agency and limit its resources may lead to another disaster similar to Hurricane Katrina.

FEMA’s ‘Katrina Declaration’

Why you should care:

The FEMA workers' letter, titled ""Katrina Declaration,"" accuses President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department supervises FEMA, of dissolving the agency’s response abilities and appointing unqualified leadership.

The group calls for FEMA to be protected from political interference and for its team to be guarded from politically motivated firings.

""Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator. Decisions made by FEMA’s Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator (SOPDA) David Richardson, Former SOPDA Cameron Hamilton, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem erode the capacity of FEMA and our State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) partners, hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,"" the letter states.

FEMA’s letter also outlines Six Statements of Opposition from its employees which they hope to come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina but the division of FEMA itself.

In June, President Donald Trump said he wanted to ""phase out"" FEMA and shift the responsibility of emergency response to states.

What does FEMA do?

The backstory:

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, widely known as FEMA, was created in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter to help states manage disasters.

The agency’s mission was further defined by the Stafford Act of 1988, which ""provided clear direction for emergency management and established the current statutory framework for disaster response and recovery through presidential disaster declarations,"" according to FEMA's website.

In 2003, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signed the Homeland Security Act establishing the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA falls under the umbrella of DHS.

Disaster response is already locally led and state-managed, but FEMA supports it by coordinating resources from federal agencies, providing direct assistance programs for households and moving money to states for repairing public infrastructure.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/08/1280/720/fema.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-26 20:56:18.905496

According to the Associated Press, some 200 people gathered, prayed and crowded around Abrego García as he reported to a scheduled visit at the ICE office, where he was detained. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him, the crowd yelled “Shame,” the AP reported.

Abrego García, a Salvadoran national, has lived in Maryland for 14 years and has been at the center of an immigration battle with the Trump administration since March when he was detained by ICE and mistakenly deported to El Salvador. According to reporting by National Public Radio, he was returned to the United States in April and was immediately detained by the U.S. government on charges of human smuggling. He was held in a Tennessee jail until he was released on Aug. 22 to await trial in Maryland, NPR said.

ABC reported that after Abrego García declined a government offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to the human smuggling charges, his attorneys said ICE informed them that he could be deported to Uganda and ordered him to report to their office in Baltimore on Aug. 25.

After he was detained on Aug. 25 in Baltimore, his attorneys filed a lawsuit to fight his deportation until a court could hear his request for protection. According to the AP, the lawsuit “triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days.”

He now is being held at an ICE detention facility in Virginia.

In an interview with Episcopal News Service, Schofield-Broadbent said she was invited to take part in the rally by the office of Washington Bishop Marianne Budde, noting that because of their geographic proximity, the two bishops speak often. Abrego García, his wife and their child have been living in Maryland’s Prince George’s County, which is part of the Diocese of Washington.

Before deciding to attend, the bishop thought about it, she said, to make sure her attendance wouldn’t be simply performative. She decided to take part because she wanted people to see “that there are ways of being Christian and following Jesus that don’t look like following blindly behind Christian nationalism.”

She added, “I want whoever is looking to see Christians standing up for mercy and justice and liberation.”

The Rev. Steve Holt, rector of the Church of the Guardian Angel in Remington, Maryland, also took part, she said.

Schofield-Broadbent, who wore her purple bishop’s shirt and pectoral cross, said she knew she was asked to stand near the podium because event organizers often put people “who look like they have some standing in the community front and center.”

She found herself next to Abrego García and his wife and across from Rabbi Ariana Katz, who had been asked to offer a final blessing. Katz asked Schofield-Broadbent if she spoke Spanish, which she does, so she was able to translate a portion of it into Abrego García’s native language.

Schofield-Broadbent said she also whispered her own blessing in his ear. “I know he’s a man of faith, so I thought maybe having a blessing from a clergyperson would be helpful.”

At the rally, Schofield-Broadbent joined clergy representing a variety of Christian denominations, as well as Jewish, Buddhist and Unitarian Universalist traditions, according to Religion News Service.

Taking part in the rally, she said, “felt like I was offering everything I had, and it was absolutely not enough to change the outcome” of Abrego García’s detention.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

The White House had no immediate comment.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Trump administration directs immigration officials to screen for 'anti-Americanism'

Cullen was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020. He serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies.

Cullen expressed skepticism of the lawsuit during a hearing in August. He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.

Signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

RELATED STORY | Trump admin lifts age limit for new ICE recruits to bolster immigration force

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

The lawsuit was an extraordinary legal maneuver, ratcheting up the administration’s fight with the federal judiciary.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” attorney Paul Clement said during the hearing. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

ADDITIONAL REPORTING | Democrat-led cities are under a mass deportation threat

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings, and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around. In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct complaint against the judge.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2cd0199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+57/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F32%2Ffb4f4f39476ab2565c34a8af4183%2Fap25238555737519.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 22:57:13.285105

The memo said USCIS may request information from applicants, including testimonies from neighbors, employers, co-workers, and business associates who could back up their application.

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo first obtained by CBS News, and later confirmed by the department to Newsweek, showed that ""neighborhood checks"" would be brought back into use by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).

""The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent,"" USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow, in a statement to Newsweek, in part.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump and his Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, have been making various changes to the immigration system since January, stating that these are necessary to ensure national security is maintained and illegal immigration is halted.

Immigration advocates have warned that some stricter measures put up unnecessary barriers to legal status for those who have been living within U.S. law for decades.

What To Know

The policy memo, dated August 22, 2025, outlines the return of neighborhood investigations for individuals applying for U.S. citizenship or naturalization. The step has essentially been unused since 1991.

In the memo, USCIS states that these checks are necessary to fully determine an immigrant's eligibility for citizenship, including where they have lived over the previous five years, their ""good moral character""—another recently emphasized part of the process—and adherence to the U.S. Constitution.

USCIS said it was using its authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to restart neighborhood checks for all immigrants applying for citizenship, unless a waiver is granted.

The memo said USCIS may request information from applicants, including testimonies from neighbors, employers, co-workers, and business associates who could back up their application. The agency said preemptively submitting such documentation as part of an application may help move the case along.

USCIS has also implemented other vetting policies in recent weeks, including checking for ""anti-Americanism"" when reviewing all immigration benefits and checking social media profiles.

What People Are Saying

USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow, in a statement to Newsweek: ""USCIS is working to ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship. The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent.

""Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously it's responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

What's Next

The claim was filed with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In discussing the Arleta High incident, L.A. schools Supt.
The Arleta High incident renewed concerns because it happened on the campus perimeter.
School board member Kelly Gonez, who represents the Arleta High area, said the officers acted improperly.","Attorneys announced Tuesday that they have filed a $1-million damage claim against the Trump administration alleging that the recent arrest of a 15-year-old boy outside Arleta High School amounted to the “unconstitutional racial profiling” of a U.S. citizen.

The claim, filed on Monday according to paperwork provided by attorneys, cited “conduct of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents that caused the false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, [and] battery” of the boy on Aug. 11.

The Trump administration on Tuesday denied any wrongdoing, saying that the incident was one of mistaken identity.

According to school district officials, federal agents drew weapons on the boy, who is a student with a disability, and handcuffed him before his mother persuaded the agents that her son was not the individual they were looking for.

The student’s mother, Andreina Mejia, affirmed those details at a Tuesday news conference outside school district headquarters, just west of downtown L.A. While she waited in the car with her son, who attends San Fernando High School, a white truck drove up quickly — so quickly she thought it would hit her vehicle.

At least two masked men with guns approached — one on each side of the car. She said the officers pulled both of them from the car and separated them. Her son had difficulty removing his seat belt, but he did not resist as he was placed immediately in handcuffs.

“I looked at my son’s reaction, and I saw that he was scared,” Mejia said. “He didn’t know what was going on, so I just told him: ‘Don’t make any movement. Don’t move. Just follow instructions.’”

She remembers thinking: “He could be making a movement that he’s not supposed to make, and they could do something to him.”

Mejia said her son has difficulty processing language and expressing himself and receives special services. His disability put him at greater risk, she said, but he handled himself well, telling the officers that he is an American citizen, 15 years old and a student.

Mejia said she volunteered to retrieve identification for her son from their home, although this offer was not accepted. About seven minutes after the confrontation began, officers were persuaded they had detained the wrong person.

An officer then joked, to mother and son, that the boy would have an exciting experience to tell his friends about.

“There’s nothing exciting about getting guns pointed at you, especially when you’re a 15-year-old,” Mejia said.

According to the cover letter of the claim, signed by attorney Luis Carrillo, “the ICE agents and Border Patrol agents falsely claimed that [the student] was a suspect of a crime.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied racial profiling.

“Allegations that Border Patrol targeted Arleta High School are FALSE,” the department statement said. “Agents were conducting a targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien.”

“What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,” the statement said. “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists — truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.”

Officials added: “This is a case study of billboard law firms trying to turn family resemblance into racial animus to collect clicks, clout, and cash.”

The department also praised the mother for being cooperative in an investigation that led to the arrest — later that same day — of the boy’s cousin, an unauthorized immigrant who, according to the department, had a 2021 misdemeanor conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.

On Tuesday, attorneys for the Mejia family said the Homeland Security account misrepresented the situation. They said the man ultimately arrested is not a member of the same family and is of a different nationality. They do not look alike, the attorneys said.

“There’s no resemblance, except for the brown color,” said Carrillo. “That’s why they were confused thinking that this — her boy — was the gang member when there was never a case.”

Attorney Michael Carrillo said that linking the family to the arrest of a gang member could potentially have put the family in danger.

A claim, such as the one filed in this case, provides a government entity the opportunity to assess and compensate alleged victims. If a claim is denied, parties have the option to pursue litigation. The claim was filed with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In discussing the Arleta High incident, L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho talked, at a recent news conference, of what he learned from the family, from school administrators and from reviewing video.

“He was released, but the trauma in his mind has not been released,” Carvalho said. “I spoke with the mom. He cries. He is upset. He is depressed. He keeps asking if this is going to happen again.”

Federal officials have said no place is off limits — including schools — as they press to reach President Trump’s goal of 1 million deportations per year.

Immigration agents attempted to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools in April, but the principals turned them away. The Arleta High incident renewed concerns because it happened on the campus perimeter. Immigration agents also recently arrested — on Aug. 8 — an 18-year-old Reseda High senior as he was walking the family dog near their Van Nuys home.

Federal officials have defended the arrest — and ongoing detention — of the Reseda High student, Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, as appropriate because they say he is in the country illegally.

After the Arleta incident, the officials lauded the ultimate arrest of the targeted individual.

“Once again, our agents keeping streets and the American tax-payer safe from criminals and we will keep doing so until the mission is accomplished,” said U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino in a social media post.

“This illegal alien from El Salvador was arrested in Pacoima, CA.,” Bovino posted on social media about the boy’s purported cousin. “Not only was he illegally in the United States, but he also has a misdemeanor in 2021 for ‘carrying a concealed weapon on person.’ He is also suspected of being a member of the MS-13 street gang,” Bovina posted on social media.

Mejia’s attorneys called on President Trump to exempt schools and areas near them from immigration enforcement actions. They also called on the school district to release video footage of the incident. The district has declined requests from multiple parties, including The Times, citing privacy restrictions.

School board member Kelly Gonez, who represents the Arleta High area, said the officers acted improperly.

“Such actions — violently detaining a child just outside a public school — are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,” Gonez said in a social media post.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d150e08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+329/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fcc%2Fa76734b34f009aaefe81ba2fc6db%2F1519674-me-arleta-high-student-01-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 18:56:53.456454

The targeting of delivery drivers appears to be widespread, however, and has led to a dramatic decline in the number of visible delivery drivers on the streets.
Across D.C., residents have posted videos of police swooping in to arrest delivery drivers.
ICE has zeroed in on delivery drivers, Lukens believes, because they are easy prey.
“It’s very clear ICE is targeting delivery drivers because they’re outdoors, which makes it easier to do warrantless arrests.","Angry residents of a Washington high-rise apartment building gathered as federal agents, backed by Metropolitan Police Department officers, swooped in to encircle a delivery driver last week.

The armed agents with tactical vests arrived first. They were joined by District police officers and a truck brimming with the sorts of mopeds and scooters used by delivery drivers. Soon, the driver’s moped — representing another livelihood of a person at the bottom of Silicon Valley’s pecking order — was added to the pile.

Residents pleading for the driver’s release were ignored. As the police van drove away, one resident shouted at the driver, “Fuck you!” The officer lowered his window and spat in the resident’s direction.

Scenes like this have become common in a city under siege by President Donald Trump’s administration, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and a federalized police force. The delivery drivers are only the latest targets of Trump’s attempt to turn the city into a test run for deploying troops and federal agents to cities that oppose his administration.

The delivery drivers’ whizzing motorcycles, mopeds, and electric bicycles filled city streets just a few weeks before, but now advocates say they’ve become a top ICE target.

Hard numbers about the crackdown are hard to come by. In a statement, the police department linked the arrests of delivery drivers to an operation that dates back to last year — without acknowledging ICE’s new role. The targeting of delivery drivers appears to be widespread, however, and has led to a dramatic decline in the number of visible delivery drivers on the streets.

In stark contrast to Trump’s first term, when the major ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft both came out against the government’s Muslim ban, the big players in the food-delivery space have been quiet about the administration’s attack on their workforce.

Advocates for immigrants and low-wage workers said the companies owe it to their drivers to speak out.

“I would hope that every employer in the District is not only finding ways to protect their staff, but they are also speaking out and speaking to their elected folks about how unhappy they are,” said Michael Lukens, executive director of Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which represents people facing deportation in the D.C. area. “Profit cannot be paramount over people.”

A “Lazy” Tactic

Lukens’s nonprofit has already seen an increase in newly arrested clients, including those who worked as delivery drivers before the federal takeover of D.C.’s police force began August 11.

Videos bear that out. Across D.C., residents have posted videos of police swooping in to arrest delivery drivers. In one scene captured by bystanders on video, a delivery driver emerging from a coffee shop was tackled to the ground and pummeled by masked ICE agents.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Metro police attempted to tie the recent videos of violent arrests involving ICE to a monthslong operation.

“In response to community complaints about unsafe scooter driving behavior, the Metropolitan Police Department began conducting scooter enforcement in 2024,” the department said. “Since Operation Ride Right started, we have impounded approximately 1,249 scooters, made 139 arrests, and issued 1,258 Notice of Infractions.”

The operation predated the Trump administration and what the statement left out was ICE’s new, heavy-handed role. The agency has specifically been partnering with the city’s police officers to check drivers’ immigration status, the Washington Post reported last week.

ICE has zeroed in on delivery drivers, Lukens believes, because they are easy prey.

“It’s very clear ICE is targeting delivery drivers because they’re outdoors, which makes it easier to do warrantless arrests. It’s a population that ICE is aware is very immigrant-heavy. And frankly, it’s easy for ICE to go after them,” Lukens said. “It is, to me, a very lazy way for ICE to operate.”

In Washington, many delivery drivers are recently arrived Venezuelan immigrants, putting them even more in harm’s way because ICE is fast-tracking deportations for people who have not been in the U.S. for long.

“Given the government’s racial profiling, and profiling of people from Venezuela and Central America as potential gang members,” Lukens said, “that is also problematic.”

The Sound of Silence

The street corners where drivers once gathered to await new orders have emptied out since the joint police–ICE crackdown began.

As authorities round up their work force, the big players in the world of Silicon Valley-developed delivery apps have largely remained silent. Three of the biggest — Uber, Grubhub, and DoorDash — did not respond to requests for comment.

That silence disappointed but did not surprise Katie Wells, the co-author of a book about the rise of Uber.

The app companies have long relied on exploiting low-wage workers, Wells said. A core premise of the apps’ business models is that their workers are independent contractors, not direct employees. Even before the crackdown, delivery drivers faced the physical risk of accidents on the road and the economic risk of account deactivations with little support from the companies.

“The violence, the stress of getting there on time, and the indignities of being deactivated without a single human to call for help — it makes the jobs very difficult,” said Wells, who is the director of research at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank that opposes excessive corporate power.

Organizing efforts have made slow progress given the fragmented nature of the workforce, with the exception of groups such as Los Deliveristas Unidos in New York City. The app companies have deployed armies of lobbyists to fight back against attempts to regulate the industry through minimum pay guarantees or pay transparency rules.

In many cases, immigrant delivery drivers rent time on the apps from people who are legally authorized to work in the U.S., according to Sergio Avedian, a rideshare driver, industry consultant, and senior contributor at the Rideshare Guy.

The people whose names are on the account sometimes fail to turn over the agreed-upon split of the earnings to the drivers, according to Avedian.

For years, the app industry has relied on undocumented workers to meet the demand for its always-on, nearly-instant delivery services, Avedian said. But it has made few efforts to ensure that they are being treated well.

“Capital doesn’t care about fairness,” Avedian said. “But as far as these immigrants, my heart goes out to them. They get screwed every possible way.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229749394-e1756148994723.jpg?fit=5000%2C2500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-26 20:56:43.135475

(AP) — A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade arrest by U.S. immigration agents lost an attempt Tuesday to throw out the Trump administration’s case against her.

The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump’ s administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.

She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She quickly filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.

However, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Tuesday rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.

Adelman said the dispute boils down to Dugan arguing that there is a general rule of immunity for judges from prosecution, with some limited exceptions, while the government argues that the cited exceptions are simply examples of types of prosecutions that have been brought.

“A review of the relevant history reveals the government has the better of the argument,” Adelman wrote.

He said that “the particulars of this case may be unusual,” but “there is no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job.’”

Attorneys for Dugan said in a statement that they were disappointed with the judge’s decision, but “we look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

Steve Caballero, spokesman for prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s Milwaukee, had no comment on the ruling.

Adelman’s decision could be appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He scheduled a hearing in the case for Sept. 3.

Dugan has pleaded not guilty to helping a man in the country illegally try to evade authorities. No trial date has been set. She faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.

In a motion in May to dismiss the charges, Dugan argued that the federal government violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.

Dugan also argued that the prosecution under federal law violated the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers because it overrides the state of Wisconsin’s ability to administer its courts.

The judge rejected her arguments.

Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

Milwaukee police last week released body camera footage of Dugan saying she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally. The comments were captured three days before her arrest after Dugan called police because of potentially threatening flyers she and family members had received.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly “hid” Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to say she didn’t know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally, and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan’s case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.

The Trump administration has unleashed a relentless, coordinated assault on immigrants – tearing families apart through mass deportations, jailing people in inhumane detention centers, and sending armed ICE agents into our schools, churches, and neighborhoods.

Now, they’re seeking to justify and cover up their harmful abuses with misinformation and lies — and it’s up to us to expose the truth.

See if you can dispel fact from fiction… because it’s up to each of us to know exactly what’s really happening.

Email Address

President Trump’s policies have resolved the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Fact

Fiction

Pure fiction! The situation at the U.S.-Mexico border has become an even bigger human rights disaster. While the Trump administration is communicating as if the border has been “handled,” this is far from the truth. Right now, approximately one-third of the entire U.S. southern border is a militarized zone. With the border closed, people are being deported or held in crowded detention centers.

The right to seek asylum in the U.S. no longer exists – meaning that people seeking safety are trapped with nowhere to go, or must return to the danger they fled.

Mass deportations are benefiting the U.S. economy.

Fact

Fiction

Fiction. Mass deportations are incredibly costly, and now funds and resources are being further expended to build horrific detention centers like “Alligator Alcataraz” and use military flights for deportations. The Trump administration’s cruel mass detention and deportation machine is now being supercharged with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — which gives a $150 billion blank check to ICE and CBP.

Amnesty is doing research on the socioeconomic consequences of Trump’s new budget that will take away Medicaid and food assistance to pay for more cruel deportations.

The U.S. is able to bring back people who have been deported or expelled.

Fact

Fiction

This is a fact, despite what the administration has led us to believe! The Trump administration illegally expelled hundreds of men to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act — sending them to CECOT, a notoriously dangerous mega-prison with inhumane conditions. Many of these men had pending asylum cases in U.S. immigration court, and some had even been granted protection. We’ve learned that these men are still technically under the custody of the U.S. — and this administration has the power to bring them back. That’s why Amnesty continues to advocate in and out of Congress to urge the U.S. to bring back everyone who has been disappeared to CECOT, and it’s why we need your continued activism.

Watch this video before answering the below question.

ICE agents have the authority to enter private spaces without a warrant.

Fact

Fiction

Fiction – although it’s happening anyway, and in many instances, illegally. The Trump administration has emboldened domestic law enforcement agencies to participate in immigration enforcement, from local police to federal agencies like the FBI and DEA. Still, none of these agencies can legally enter private spaces without a warrant signed by a judge. Even as officers drive through immigrant communities in unmarked cars and raid schools and workplaces wearing masks, people still have rights.

There are “millions” of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

Fact

Fiction

This is a fiction that President Trump has been repeating over and over to justify his mass deportation machine. Studies show that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens. The Trump administration’s inflammatory and racist rhetoric is meant to dehumanize and criminalize our immigrant neighbors, friends, family members, and coworkers. It’s so important for our human rights movement to voice our opposition, defend everyone’s rights, and build true safety and power for our communities.

Sean’s nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself.” A spokesperson for New Mexico Gov.","California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.

An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing states' enforcement before the crash.

Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency, and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash should not have been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. The crash has become increasingly political, with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the administration's immigration concerns in interviews.

But Duffy said it is a safety issue — not a political one — because truckers need to be able to tell law enforcement what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.

“We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs — semis — can understand the road signs, that they’ve been well trained,” Duffy said.

The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.

Duffy cited similar statistics for the other states, with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. He said New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.

Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don’t comply with the rules within 30 days — $33 million for California, $10.5 million for Washington and $7 million for New Mexico.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on the social platform X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash.

“This is rich,” it said. “The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people — and now they’re scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean’s nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself.”

A spokesperson for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state's process for issuing commercial licenses includes a mandatory English component to ensure divers can read and understand traffic signals.

“We are aware of recent claims regarding the enforcement of these regulations and are actively seeking more information,” Michael Coleman said via email. “Initial reports suggest that these claims relate to a small number of roadside incidents over a three-month period.”

Washington’s governor declined to comment until after officials review Duffy’s letter.

Three people died when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach and a minivan slammed into his trailer, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. Singh and his passenger were not injured.

He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh’s case during his initial appearance Saturday morning.

Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, but it will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how his status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she cannot recall a case that garnered more attention.

“Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,” Litty said.

The head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group, which represents small-business truck drivers, praised Duffy's announcement.

“Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle — reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement,” said Todd Spencer, the group’s president.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's license by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.

But the governor's office in New Mexico said a body-camera video of the police stop of Singh makes it clear that he understands English.

Released Tuesday, the video shows Singh speaking in broken English during the highway-side stop and commercial vehicle inspection by a New Mexico State Police officer. Singh responds to a series of instructions during the inspection, and asks how long the citation will be linked to his license.

“This my ticket and on my license ... how many year?” Singh says.

The officer issues Singh a reduced speeding citation for driving 10 mph (17 kph) above the speed limit in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone, noting Singh's explanation that he was already trying to slow down.

“We believe that a full review of the incidents in question will demonstrate that New Mexico is in full compliance with federal law and that New Mexico State Police are effectively enforcing safety regulations on our roadways,” Coleman said.

Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia issue licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.

Newsom's office said California followed all the rules when it issued a license for Singh in July 2024, while the federal government confirmed at that time that he was in the country legally. Newsom has also said Singh obtained a work permit during Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.

Florida authorities have said Singh entered illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received the license.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois says it would fight back in court if President Trump sends the National Guard into Chicago.

Trump has suggested he would send troops there to combat violent crime.

ACLU of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka told IPM News Monday that if that happens, the organization would be closely watching the behavior of those troops.

“Who is it that they’re targeting? How are they doing it, and how are they behaving, Yohnka asked. “Are they using excessive force? Are they using racial profiling?”

He also said the ACLU would also sue on behalf of detained individuals to get them released.

The ACLU has been communicating with groups that serve immigrant and homeless people, who are particularly afraid after seeing videos of the National Guard’s activity in Washington DC, according to Yohnka.

Earlier Monday, President Trump hedged on the idea of sending troops to Chicago, saying he’d prefer to be invited by local officials. Both Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson say they have not requested federal troops.

Yohnka encouraged those feeling overwhelmed by federal policy changes to focus on local action such as speaking up at local meetings to joining library or school boards.

“I know it’s hard to keep up with all that’s happening at the federal level,” he added. “We’ve been encouraging folks to act as much as they can at the local level.”

ACLU fighting immigrant kid exclusion for Head Start

The ACLU of Illinois is involved in a lawsuit to keep Head Start open to all low-income children.

Head Start began 60 years ago as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” to help children break the cycle of poverty with health screening, social services and education.

When a Republican Congress and then President Bill Clinton were reshaping welfare law in the 1990’s, the early education program was excluded from the changes. New provisions in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act barred certain immigrants, including those without legal status and those who have applied but not received asylum from signing up for public benefits.

The Trump administration is now reinterpreting the law to apply to Head Start and other education programs.

“I’m thinking that if that’s what Newt Gingrich and the Republicans of the 1990’s meant, they would have said it, and I think he would have heard it again,” Yohnka said. “But apparently, Donald Trump and RFK Jr. are the people who’ve suddenly discovered this.”

The administration says the change would help protect the country’s resources. The rule is on hold until September 3, due to another lawsuit.",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041625_KellyTownHall8_M.Piacente-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 17:56:48.791988

DACA Recipients Fear Losing Health Care Access, Annual Report Shows

One-third of respondents reported worsening health related to concerns about their immigration status

WASHINGTON – A report published today by the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) shows that an overwhelming majority of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients fear losing future access to health care services and many are experiencing worsening health due to concerns about their immigration status.

Concerns about access to health care likely stem from uncertainty around DACA’s future, as well as the Trump administration’s ending of the Biden-era policy allowing DACA recipients to purchase health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A new Trump administration rule ending the Biden policy – which was a hard fought victory after years of advocacy – went into effect this week.

“All of us should be able to access affordable and reliable health care. Full stop,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center. “After years of data showing DACA recipients are disproportionately uninsured, this year’s report shows that the uncertainty around DACA and narrowing options for recipients to access care have reverberating effects on both their physical and mental health. We demand the Trump administration to reverse its cruel and unnecessary ACA eligibility rule, and Congress must work to repeal health care restrictions for immigrants.”

This is the fourth annual report by NILC tracking DACA recipients’ access to health care. The report analyzes findings from a 2024 survey of 433 DACA recipients administered by Prof. Tom K. Wong of the University of California, San Diego; United We Dream; the National Immigration Law Center; and the Center for American Progress. Top line findings include:

92% of respondents say that without DACA, it will be harder to access services to keep themselves and their families healthy

1/3 of respondents experienced worsened mental or physical health related to concerns over their immigration status

43% of respondents skipped a recommended medical test or treatment because of the cost, while 45% reported skipping a recommended dental test or treatment for the same reason

28% of respondents reported taking on debt to cover the costs of a medical procedure

NILC formally opposed the Trump administration’s rule ending DACA recipients’ access to ACA coverage and urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reverse it. NILC also calls on Congress to repeal health care restrictions for immigrants passed in the latest federal budget bill and has long called for Congress to pass the Dream and Promise Act, which would provide the certainty and stability that DACA recipients need to truly achieve healthy lives.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old originally from El Salvador, handed himself into the ICE field office in Baltimore, Maryland, for a check-in on Monday.

The visit was a mandatory condition of his release from federal custody earlier this weekend. However, in a court filing on Saturday, his lawyers said they expected Garcia would be detained again upon attending.

Garcia is charged in an indictment, filed in federal court in Tennessee, with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants into the US.

According to a court filing by his lawyers, immigration officials made an offer to Garcia to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to the charges.

Otherwise, they would seek to deport him to Uganda.

Speaking at a news conference outside the ICE office on Monday morning, Garcia said via a translator: ""This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us.

""God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.""

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Garcia's lawyers, also said: ""There was no need to take him into ICE detention... the only reason they took him into detention was to punish him.""

A judge later ruled Garcia could not be deported after he filed a challenge asking to be allowed due process to fight any removal attempt.

Judge Paula Xinis ruled the 30-year-old must remain detained in the US until she can hold an evidentiary hearing - set for Wednesday.

She added there appeared to be ""several grounds"" for her to have jurisdiction to exercise relief, including that Uganda has not agreed to offer Garcia protections, such as being able to walk freely, being given refugee status, and not being re-deported to El Salvador.

After initially being detained in Maryland - where he lived with his American wife and children - by ICE in March, Garcia was sent to El Salvador, where he was then imprisoned in the country's maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).

This was despite an immigration judge's 2019 order granting him protection from deportation after finding he was likely to be persecuted by local gangs if he was returned to his native country.

The Trump administration admitted deporting Garcia was an ""administrative error"", but said at the time they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador.

After eventually returning him to the US in June, the Trump administration detained Garcia on criminal charges that were filed in May.

The criminal indictment alleges Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators to bring immigrants to the US illegally and transport them from the border to other destinations in the country.

Minutes after his release on Friday, officials notified Garcia they intended to deport him to Uganda.

Gavin Newsom's office over immigration.

Harjinder Singh made the illegal turn last Tuesday from northbound lanes of Florida's Turnpike about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A minivan was unable to avoid the truck's trailer, which was blocking the northbound lanes.

Two passengers in the minivan died at the scene and the driver died at a hospital. Singh and a passenger in his truck were not injured.

Much of Singh's immigration history was not immediately clear Monday, including his country of citizenship and whether and when he obtained legal status. Florida authorities said he entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.

Homeland Security said Singh obtained a commercial driver's license in California, which is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issue licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Supporters of such policies say driver's licenses provide a lifeline for people to work, pick up children from school, visit doctors and travel safely.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for Homeland Security, said issuing a commercial license to someone in the country illegally is ""asinine.""

Newsom's press office, which has been in a heated online war of words over congressional redistricting, responded on the X platform that Singh obtained a work permit while Donald Trump was president. McLaughlin disputed that, saying the government denied him a permit during Trump's first term in September 2020 and granted him one in June 2021, under President Joe Biden.

Singh is charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. The federal government has asked that he be transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after his criminal case is complete.

He said there could be more agents on the way.

""I would see more Border Patrol agents coming here into Los Angeles pretty quickly, like within the next week,"" said Bovino, who stressed the agency's main objective has always been ""safer communities"" and ""a safer America.""

""As we look at immigration laws, and immigration law violators here in L.A., one of the things that we note is as we target individuals in areas ... that targeting is something that we rely on to get into those areas to be where we're at in L.A.,"" said Bovino. ""Whether it's Compton or Brentwood or Hollywood or downtown Los Angeles or at a big box store. Those targets are definite, and we know oftentimes who we're going after, why we're going after them, and what their criminal history is.

Human rights groups and immigration advocates continue to raise concerns over tactics used by federal agents during its operations.

During Monday's interview, Bovino discussed agents not wearing uniforms during operations and the use of face masks.

""We have a multitude of law enforcement missions to carry out,"" he said. ""Our functions here in Los Angeles and nationwide, whether it's on the border or here in Los Angeles, you see that exact same thing.""

""It would be awfully difficult for me to waltz in a parking lot of a big box store, or some location that we're interested in, to conduct surveillance and trying to find someone who's illegal or a criminal or a target that we're looking for if we're in full uniform,"" he added. ""So like any police agency, or any type of a law enforcement function nationwide, it's the same thing with us. We will deploy individuals the way we need to to affect the mission.""

Trump defends crime crackdown: 'I'm not a dictator'

Meantime, Trump, at his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, touted his record on crime amid his federal takeover of Washington and threats to do the same in other major cities.

""The line is that I'm a dictator, but I stop crime. So a lot of people say, 'You know, if that's the case, I'd rather have a dictator,'"" he said. ""But I'm not a dictator. I just know how to stop crime.""

Trump said the same on Monday, as he discussed how he would prefer local officials to request his help as he discussed the possibility of ordering the National Guard to Chicago.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, in a press conference on Monday responding to Trump's threat, said that the president and the White House are trying to terrorize Democratic-run cities and states through the threat of unwarranted crackdowns.

""This is not about fighting crime. This is about Donald Trump searching for any justification to deploy the military in a blue city, in a blue state, to try and intimidate his political rivals,"" Pritzker said, flanked by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and a wide array of Chicago and Illinois elected officials and residents.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.
“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote.
“In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.
Judicial Immunity Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.","A federal judge has dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the US district judges of Maryland over a standing order that blocked the immediate deportation of some detained persons.

US District Judge Thomas Cullen, who President Donald Trump appointed during his first term, said Tuesday past rulings lead to the conclusion that he has no choice but to dismiss the case.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.

He also said the lawsuit is “not ordinary” and that the executive branch must find other paths to raise its concerns with the standing order. He said the courts and the executive branch are each part of the sovereign US government.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches—and the public officials who serve in them—share the same core sovereign interest: To support and defend the Constitution.”

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The department filed a notice of appeal.

Deportation Fights

The Trump administration filed the suit in June against the court over a standing order that blocked for two business days the deportations of detained persons who filed habeas petitions.

The order was issued amid the administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement, and a Maryland US district judge’s handling of a lawsuit from a wrongly deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The administration initially said it couldn’t return Garcia after he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an earlier immigration court ruling against his removal. But he was brought back to the United States to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he’s pleaded not guilty to. Abrego Garcia was again taken into custody by immigration officials on Monday, and is seeking to block any deportation.

Cullen said he can “appreciate” the administration’s concern that the Maryland court “encroached on its duty to police core matters of immigration.”

But he said a dispute between the judiciary should be “resolved within the constitutional structure and with due respect for the Judiciary’s co-equal standing with the executive branch,” and that he has to first ensure he has the constitutional authority to preside over the lawsuit. “In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity

Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.

He also said the district court has sovereign immunity from the case, and that the individual judges and court officials named in the litigation have judicial immunity because it was tied to an act done in their “judicial function.”

Cullen further found there was no cause of action that allowed him to hear the lawsuit between the two branches, “and this court will not be the first to create one.”

He said the administration could’ve challenged the standing order at the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, or by petitioning the Fourth Circuit’s Judicial Council.

“The Executive acknowledges these routes are available, but it claims it chose an interbranch lawsuit because those routes are inconvenient,” Cullen wrote. “This purported inconvenience does not warrant the judicial branch’s infringement on the legislative branch’s prerogative of deciding the scope of cases federal courts may review.”

‘Not Normal Times’

The unprecedented litigation came as the administration has assailed judges who’ve ruled against its policies, with Trump even calling for impeachment and some House Republican allies filing articles of impeachment against some jurists. Chief Justice John Roberts and other top federal judges have pushed back against the use of impeachment as a response to unfavorable court rulings.

Cullen referenced the harsh rhetoric in his opinion, saying the “concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

He said that typically, the administration could’ve raised its challenged under other options laid out by Congress.

“But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,” Cullen wrote, referring to the courts. “It’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0e9cbce/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F3a%2Fd4feebac4c4bb995f95b5fb23ec3%2Fjustice-sarah-silbiger.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 18:57:02.476889

Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year.
In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is ""committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.""
""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said.
In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to ""wean"" states off of FEMA.","A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.

The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall — sparking one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, with more than 1,800 deaths and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.

The letter argues the Trump administration — which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether — had made decisions that ""hinder the swift execution of our mission."" It states that a change in course is necessary to ""prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the ""Katrina Declaration"" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to ""the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.""

It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.

The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA ""lack proper qualifications,"" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.

""Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,"" the open letter reads.

It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.

In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is ""committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people."" He said the agency has been ""bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,"" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.

""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said. ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.""

FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.

Days after his inauguration, the president floated either ""getting rid of FEMA"" or ""fundamentally reforming and overhauling"" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to ""wean"" states off of FEMA.

The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.

So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.

Social Security data is highly sought after by criminals and foreign governments, who can use the information for identity theft or to gather intelligence.","That crackdown appears to have now ensnared a different member of the Federal Reserve Board, Lisa Cook. On Monday evening, President Trump fired Ms. Cook because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage, a step that could give him greater control over the central bank.

After Mr. Trump announced that Ms. Cook was fired, Mr. Pulte celebrated on social media.

“Thank you President Trump for your commitment to stopping mortgage fraud and following the law,” Mr. Pulte wrote on X. “If you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, no matter who you are.”

Mr. Pulte, who has more than three million followers on social media, has used his position at the housing finance agency to attack and investigate Mr. Trump’s political enemies. He has accused Mr. Powell of mismanaging the renovation of the Fed’s headquarters and initiated mortgage fraud investigations into Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who prosecuted Mr. Trump and his companies, and Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the effort to impeach Mr. Trump during his first term.

Then he seized on Ms. Cook.

Last week, Mr. Pulte posted images of her signatures that appeared to show that she improperly designated both a condominium in Atlanta and a home in Ann Arbor, Mich., as her primary residence when taking out loans. In doing so, Mr. Pulte said, Ms. Cook appeared to have “falsified bank documents and property records” that could have allowed her to obtain lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.

“When someone commits mortgage fraud, they undermine the faith and integrity of our System,” Mr. Pulte wrote on X, adding that he was referring the case to the Department of Justice.

Ms. Cook said she would not step down from the central bank’s board, saying that “no cause exists under the law” for Mr. Trump to fire her. A lawyer representing Ms. Cook said he was readying a lawsuit to challenge the firing. She has not been charged with a crime.

Before Mr. Trump fired her, Ms. Cook had issued a brief statement saying she had “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” Ms. Cook added that she took “questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”

The claims against Ms. Cook come as Mr. Trump has railed against the central bank for being slow to cut interest rates and has looked to staff the central bank with loyalists. He has already picked Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser, to fill a seat that recently opened up after another governor, Adriana Kugler, left her post months before her term was up.

Mortgage occupancy fraud can be used to help buyers get lower interest rates or down payments when purchasing a home. According to Cotality, a real estate data provider, mortgage fraud increased slightly in the second quarter of 2025, but just 0.86 percent of all mortgage applications contained fraud.

A 2023 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that on average, between 2 and 3 percent of borrowers misrepresent their occupancy status when applying for a mortgage, though it was significantly higher during the run-up to the financial crisis. Most cases of occupancy fraud are uncovered when a borrower defaults on a mortgage, and it tends to be more common with investor-owned homes.

The role of director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is usually a low-profile one, but that has not been the case for Mr. Pulte, who has transformed the agency into a weapon for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Pulte, 37, came to run the housing agency with little housing policy experience. A grandson of William Pulte, who was the founder of PulteGroup, one of the largest American home builders, he did not play an active role at the company, though he did serve as a board member from 2016 to 2020.

Before being tapped by Mr. Trump to run housing agency, Mr. Pulte was best known for running his own investment firm and helping to clean up blighted homes in Detroit — not far from where PulteGroup got its start.

His main job as the agency’s director is overseeing the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the twin engines that drive the nation’s housing market. Fannie and Freddie have been under government control since the federal government had to bail them out during the 2008 financial crisis to prevent an even greater collapse of the housing market.

Even though the companies are controlled by the government, they operate quasi-independently. But one of the first things Mr. Pulte did was to name himself as chairman of the boards of both companies and oust a number of board members.

In a post on Sunday, Mr. Pulte said reducing fraud was critical to improving the mortgage firms.

“Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are getting stronger each and every day,” Mr. Pulte wrote. “And once we eliminate mortgage fraud, will be even stronger!”

On Monday, he reposted copies of Mr. Trump’s firing letter and hailed the president for becoming the first to ever remove a Federal Reserve governor. He also issued an ominous warning about Ms. Cook’s potential legal fate.

“Mortgage fraud can carry up to 30 years in prison,” Mr. Pulte said.

Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York.

The emerging legal clash threatened to compromise the independence and integrity of the nation’s central bank, a powerful institution at the heart of the economy whose responsibilities are to keep prices stable and the labor market strong. The Fed is supposed to be insulated from the pressures of politics, but Mr. Trump has unleashed an unprecedented string of attacks on its members, all in the hopes of getting them to lower interest rates.

“She can’t have an infraction, especially that infraction,” Mr. Trump said at a meeting of his cabinet, referring to the allegations against Ms. Cook.

“We need people that are 100 percent above board, and it doesn’t seem like she was,” he added, highlighting the fact that he might have a “majority very shortly” at the Fed.

Mr. Trump announced his decision to fire Ms. Cook in a note posted late Monday to social media. The president justified his actions by pointing to a provision in the Fed’s founding statute that allows him to dismiss a board member if he can identify sufficient cause, which is generally understood to mean negligence or malfeasance.

But Ms. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, later said in a statement that the president’s “attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis.” While Mr. Lowell did not elaborate, his comment appeared to echo the myriad issues raised by legal experts, who contend that Mr. Trump has not met the burden under law to warrant a firing — and did not provide Ms. Cook sufficient opportunity to respond.

“We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,” Mr. Lowell said.

Mr. Trump’s attempts to remove Ms. Cook quickly infuriated congressional Democrats, who assailed the president for an abuse of power. The Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday specifically rebuked the White House for engaging in a “racist, misogynistic, and unlawful attack on the integrity and independence” of the central bank.

But the president and his aides appeared unfazed by the criticisms on a day when markets reacted little to the news.

Mr. Trump at one point suggested that he was already considering a replacement for Ms. Cook, even before a legal challenge over her firing was resolved. The president appeared to be referring to Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, whom Mr. Trump previously announced as a replacement for Adriana Kugler, who resigned from the Fed months before the end of her term. Mr. Miran has not been confirmed by the Senate for the role.

Still, much remained uncertain in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Trump’s move to fire Ms. Cook, who has not yet filed her lawsuit. The Justice Department, for its part, declined to comment Tuesday on if or when it would file any charges against the Fed governor, even though the president maintained this week that the accusations of mortgage fraud were sufficient enough “to remove” Ms. Cook from her position.

The Fed, for its part, took no identifiable stance on Tuesday either on the legality of the president’s actions or the allegations levied against Ms. Cook. In its first public comments since the president’s late-night missive, a Fed spokesperson said the central bank would “abide by any court decision.”

“Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law.”

The allegations against Ms. Cook originated with Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has joined with Mr. Trump in repeatedly savaging the Fed and its members for keeping interest rates steady.

Last week, Mr. Pulte said he had obtained documents showing that Ms. Cook represented two different homes as her primary residence, claiming that she falsified those records to obtain more favorable terms on her mortgages. He called on her to resign, prompting Mr. Trump to say that he would fire her if she did not.

The allegations were only the latest instance in which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pulte have sought to weaponize the instruments of government against the president’s perceived political enemies. They have also attacked Mr. Powell, claiming he is responsible for a cost overrun in the ongoing renovations at the central bank, and Mr. Pulte at one point urged the president privately to fire the Fed chairman.

With Ms. Cook, Mr. Pulte soon referred the allegations to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation, as he dangled the possibility of a prison sentence and called on her to resign.

Ms. Cook resisted those calls, saying in an initial statement that she had “no intention of being bullied” as she pledged to gather “accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.” But Mr. Trump then issued an ultimatum, promising to fire her if she did not depart on her own.

The president acted on that late Monday, writing in a letter posted to social media that Ms. Cook’s actions had compromised her ability to serve as a financial regulator.

“The Federal Reserve has tremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and regulating reserve and member banks,” Mr. Trump said. “The American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve. In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.”

Appearing early Tuesday on CNBC, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, attacked Ms. Cook as a “crook,” despite at one point acknowledging that the administration possessed only allegations of wrongdoing.

“The crook always says I’m not going anywhere, and why would anybody defend that?” Mr. Lutnick said. “The real question should be, did she commit mortgage fraud, yes or no, and if you did commit mortgage fraud, please get out of the federal government, get out of the seat of the governor of the Federal Reserve and go away.”

What did Mr. Trump say about the name?

At an event in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the name War Department “just sounded better,” adding, “I think we’re going to have to go back to that.” He said it was a reminder of the country’s record of victories in conflicts under the old name, citing World Wars I and II. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Mr. Trump that the change was “coming soon.”

In June, Mr. Trump claimed that the title of war secretary had been changed to defense secretary to be more politically correct. The next month, in a post on Truth Social praising Mr. Hegseth, the president called him the “Secretary of War.” The president and Mr. Hegseth have been eager to promote a more aggressive image of the military and cut back on rules that restrict its operations.

What’s the history of the name?

George Washington established the War Department in August 1789, just months after the Constitution was ratified and he became the first president. The department oversaw the new nation’s military forces. Its first secretary was Henry Knox, who had served as a commander during the Revolutionary War and had, since 1785, been the war secretary under the Articles of Confederation, an early agreement among the colonial states.

The name was retained for more than 150 years, during which time the United States fought wars against Britain, Spain, Mexico and the Philippines, as well as the Civil War. It also fought wars against Native Americans.

The United States entered World War I in 1917 and, after the attack on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in 1941, joined World War II on the side of the Allied powers.

Why was the name changed to the Defense Department?

According to the Truman Library Institute, President Harry S. Truman changed the name as part of the National Security Act he signed in 1947, a time when the United States was the world’s only nuclear power and the Cold War was just starting.

The law merged the Navy and War departments and a newly independent Air Force into a single organization called the National Military Establishment, under a civilian secretary of defense who also oversaw the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Two years later, Congress amended the National Security Act, and the National Military Establishment was renamed the Defense Department. Since then it has overseen wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in military history, said the name change in 1949 reflected the department’s expanded duties, which included war fighting, foreign policy, intelligence and, above all, national security.

In a nascent nuclear age, the new name also reflected an emphasis on avoiding war, Professor Kohn said.

“The decision was definitely not about political correctness,” he said. “It was to communicate to America’s adversaries and the rest of the world that America was not about making war but defending the United States, and saying that if that requires war, there are four major armed services.”

Does Mr. Trump have the power to change the department’s name?

The president cannot easily alter the Defense Department’s name or Mr. Hegseth’s title, according to Jamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School.

“The president can call the department whatever he wants in informal communication, but the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense were so named through acts of Congress, and I am unaware of any legal authority for the president to change those names by executive fiat,” Professor Greene said.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, saying that the name had a “beautiful ring.” As president, Mr. Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names as they are used in the United States.

Experts said the change in the gulf’s name put Democrats in an awkward position, since to contest it could be viewed as unpatriotic. A similar dynamic could be at play if the White House tried to revert to the name War Department.

The Defense Department referred questions about the issue to the White House.

Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature. Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Moreover, he used the ruling to take Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to task for having repeatedly attacked other judges who have dared to rule against the White House in a flurry of cases challenging aspects of its political agenda.

“Over the past several months, principal officers of the executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional, [c]rooked,’ and worse,” Judge Cullen wrote.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he concluded.

Judge Cullen’s plaintive criticism of the Trump administration’s assaults on the judiciary was in many ways reminiscent of a ruling issued in April by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit — for which he once served as a clerk — in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The ruling was written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, an icon of the conservative legal movement, who expressed deep concerns about the executive and judicial branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

“We yet cling to the hope,” Judge Wilkinson wrote, “that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

The case in front of Judge Cullen began in June when the Trump administration filed suit challenging a standing order put in place the month before. The order said that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country in the Maryland federal courts by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled.

The order was intended to give judges time to sort through the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent of those was a lawsuit brought in March by Mr. Abrego Garcia.

Judge Cullen pointed out in his ruling that the White House took “umbrage” with the standing order because Trump officials believed it hindered their ability “to police immigration matters and enforce the nation’s immigration laws.”

He admitted that such arguments might have gotten “traction” if the administration had made them “in the proper forum.” Trump officials, he said, could have appealed any individual cases where the standing order had actually slowed down an immigrant’s removal or could have contested the underlying validity of the blanket rule in front of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify such measures.

But instead, Judge Cullen maintained, the administration “chose a different, and more confrontational, path.”

“The executive decided to sue,” he wrote, “and in a big way.”

In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Cullen agreed with almost all of the arguments put forward at a hearing two weeks ago by a lawyer for the judges, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court.

The judge found that the defendants, as federal jurists, were immune from being sued and that the administration’s suit essentially violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution by having the executive branch attempt legal action against the judicial branch.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches — and the public officials who serve in them — share the same core sovereign interest: to support and defend the Constitution.”

It is not the most likely of crime-busting outfits to take to the streets of Washington. The agency specializes in tasks involving global diplomacy, such as providing protection for the secretary of state and senior aides, conducting background security checks of State Department employees and potential hires, and helping secure U.S. embassies and consulates.

But its officers are now doing beat-cop work in Washington. They are deployed in the city alongside police officers and other federal agents in what President Trump says is a crackdown on crime. Many residents call it theatrical nonsense aimed at scoring political points with voters who know little about Washington.

At least one diplomatic security officer played a leading role in the nighttime arrest on Aug. 19 of Mark Bigelow, 28, a part-time delivery driver for Amazon who was arrested on a charge of having an open container of alcohol, which was in a van.

A diplomatic security officer, Adam Kapettanis, worked with counterparts from other agencies to try putting a handcuffed Mr. Bigelow into a law enforcement vehicle, but Mr. Bigelow resisted, according to an F.B.I. agent’s affidavit in court documents. Mr. Bigelow kicked Mr. Kapettanis in the leg, the text said, citing that as an element in charging Mr. Bigelow with resisting and assaulting federal officers, which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.

Elizabeth Mullin, a federal public defender representing Mr. Bigelow, told the court that Mr. Bigelow “was caught up in this federal occupation of D.C.” — a reference to Mr. Trump’s new policy — and that “this was a case created by federal law enforcement.”

When asked on Monday whether the Diplomatic Security Service was playing a role in Mr. Trump’s actions on Washington, the State Department said in a statement to The New York Times that the security service was “actively partnering with the Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement to provide interagency support in the ongoing mission to deter and reduce crime in the District of Columbia.”

It added that “consistent with standard practice, D.S.S. routinely assesses its priorities and job functions based on the administration’s strategic interests, while maintaining our mission to lead worldwide security and law enforcement efforts, and to protect State Department people, property and information in 170+ countries and 30+ U.S. cities.”

At least one federal judge in Washington has expressed anger at the overreach by federal agents in the arrests they have been making in Washington.

The State Department’s security service has also been working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in American cities to try to detain noncitizens and deport them. In February, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, deputized up to 600 diplomatic security agents to help with “arresting and deporting illegal immigrants.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has tried to help deport noncitizens who are in the country legally, most notably people who have expressed pro-Palestinian points of view. Federal judges have rebuked him for trying to strip away green cards and visas of people for expressing political opinions, and have ordered those detainees to be released.

The Diplomatic Security Service has more than 2,500 employees worldwide, according to the State Department website. A history page has details on precursor outfits from the American Revolution to the early 20th century. The modern service was established after World War II, as the United States embraced its superpower status, and eventually expanded its duties to include counterespionage, counterterrorism and protecting top foreign officials visiting the United States. Its officers can carry firearms.

A government document from 2009 quoted a Justice Department official saying diplomatic security officers can make arrests based on visa and passport fraud charges.

The service’s operations sometimes come under criticism from other State Department employees. For instance, some Asian American diplomats have accused officers in the unit of unfairly suspecting diplomats with that ethnic background of being potential espionage threats. The service has denied that ethnicity plays a role in its determinations.

No Democrat has won a U.S. House seat in Utah since 2018.

The ruling, which can be appealed, creates an opportunity for a new map that could help Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will be fighting to hold onto their slim House majority.

It also makes Utah the latest battleground in a national fight over redistricting, as President Trump urges Republican officials to redo congressional maps in his party’s favor. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott is expected soon to sign into law a redrawn map that would deliver up to five House seats to Republicans, prompting Democrats in California to counter with their own new maps designed to offset those potential losses.

The decision in Utah came after the state’s Supreme Court said in July that the legislature had likely violated the state’s Constitution when it repealed a voter-approved measure known as Proposition Four, which required independent oversight of the redistricting process and forbade partisan gerrymandering.

In the judgment, issued on Monday, District Court Judge Dianna M. Gibson said Utah legislators were wrong to redraw the state’s boundaries without adhering to Proposition Four, and that the resulting map violated voters’ constitutional rights to participate in government.

The state’s current congressional map “is the fruit of that unlawful repeal, an extension of the very constitutional violation that tainted the process from the start,” Judge Gibson wrote.

Utah’s Republican legislature had argued that Proposition Four improperly impeded the government’s functioning and inserted voters into the redistricting process, which it said was solely the legislature’s responsibility.

Judge Gibson disagreed, saying voters needed a way to participate in redistricting efforts.

“How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices and weaken the rule of law,” the judge wrote, calling it “among the most critical responsibilities of our government.”

Utah’s current congressional map, which was adopted in 2021 after lawmakers overruled the suggestions of an advisory board, was in place for the 2022 and 2024 election cycles. Judge Gibson wrote that state officials should urgently redraw the map for the 2026 cycle in a way that meets the requirements of Proposition Four.

Her order gives the legislature 30 days to submit a redrawn map to the court. Republican officials can appeal the ruling, which could delay the timeline and keep the current map in place.

Robert Axson, chairman of the Utah Republican Party, in a statement criticized the ruling as an overreach.

“Once again, certain members of Utah’s judiciary abandon the principles of our Constitutional Republic. Using earlier flawed rulings to justify their opinions over the principles of our founding is a special kind of hubris,” the statement said.

Members of Utah’s Democratic Party applauded the decision. State Sen. Nate Blouin, who represents Utah’s 13th State Senate District, which encompasses parts of Salt Lake City, said that Democratic lawmakers were expecting challenges from Republicans.

“Utah voters got a big win tonight,” he said. “Needless to say, the supermajority will fight back hard and seek to delay us.”

On Monday, Mr. Smith’s legal team sent a letter to the Office of Special Counsel, which has no affiliation with Mr. Smith’s former position. The Office of Special Counsel conducts ethics investigations of government employees, primarily into whether people have violated the Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from using their jobs to work on behalf of a political campaign.

Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, persuaded the agency to investigate whether Mr. Smith, in seeking to quickly bring Mr. Trump to trial, violated the law. Mr. Smith’s conduct, he claimed, appeared “to have no rationale except for an attempt to affect the 2024 election results.”

Mr. Smith and his lawyers, Lanny A. Breuer and Peter Koski, fired back in a three-page letter to the acting special counsel, Jamieson Greer.

“The predicate for this investigation is imaginary and unfounded,” the lawyers wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times. “Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper.”

The letter also noted that while Mr. Greer’s office had publicly confirmed it had opened an investigation, neither Mr. Smith nor his lawyers had received any inquiries from the Office of Special Counsel. A representative for the Office of Special Counsel declined to comment.

Mr. Smith’s lawyers wrote that they “welcome the opportunity to engage with your office and are confident that as you become familiar with the facts and the record, you will conclude that there is no basis to find a violation of the Hatch Act and that these allegations are wholly without merit.”

Mr. Smith, they said, is “a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.”

Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said the argument for a Hatch Act investigation made little sense.

“I just don’t see how this comes anywhere close to a Hatch Act violation,” he said. “If Smith had made public statements shortly before the election about the filings, we would have an issue that would need to be addressed. Or if he’d written Congress, it would need to be addressed. I see no evidence that Jack Smith did anything of the kind. He simply filed pleadings with the court, and the pleadings were accepted by the courts.”

The Trump administration has taken a host of measures meant to punish his perceived enemies, firing many of the people who worked for Mr. Smith, including paralegals and office support staff, and even attacking the law firm representing Mr. Smith by issuing an executive memorandum seeking to strip it of any government business. He has also forced out F.B.I. agents and executives and demoted or reassigned a wide swath of senior Justice Department officials whom Mr. Trump and his top aides do not trust.

In firing scores of law enforcement officials based solely on Mr. Trump’s expansive claim of executive power, the administration has flouted longstanding civil service laws meant to ensure the public receives professional services from government agencies. Many of those fired individuals have sued, but the cases are moving slowly through the courts.

Mr. Smith’s lawyers argued that an ethics investigation by the Office of Special Counsel into how Justice Department prosecutors handled their court cases would radically misuse a longstanding ethics law and interfere with how the federal government investigates corruption.

“This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest,” the lawyers wrote. “But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law.”

They also urged the Office of Special Counsel not to reach a conclusion without engaging with Mr. Smith’s lawyers.

“In light of the unprecedented nature of this investigation, if you intend to go forward with this in any way, we insist that you engage with us so that any finding by the Office of Special Counsel is fully informed by the record,” they wrote. A fair review of the facts and law, they said “will compel the inescapable conclusion that the prosecutions brought by Mr. Smith were handled in an entirely lawful and appropriate manner.”

“Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology,” he posted on Truth Social, opening a new and potentially contentious chapter in the world’s continuing trade fight.

The post does not call out the European Union specifically, but Mr. Trump and other key administration officials have made it clear for months that they are unhappy with how the 27-nation bloc treats big American technology companies including X and Meta.

Republicans including Vice President JD Vance have criticized an E.U. law, the Digital Services Act, that requires social media companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illegal content and disinformation. Mr. Vance and other officials argue that the law places as an unfair burden on American platforms and undercuts free speech.

This month, Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, instructed American diplomats to lobby against the rules. And on Monday, Reuters reported that the administration was contemplating sanctions against E.U. officials who were responsible for enacting the key digital regulation.

The social media rules are not the only European technology policy that has provoked the Trump administration. American officials and technology companies have also been critical of the Digital Markets Act, which is meant to prevent large technology platforms from abusing the power that their size gives them. And some European nations have digital services taxes.

The question is whether the European Union will be able to remain unbending when it comes to technology regulation.

Mr. Trump’s outburst comes at a sensitive moment in America’s relationship with the European Union. The two trading partners just last week published the text of a trade deal that they had been working to complete.

The agreement would apply 15 percent across-the-board tariffs on most E.U. exports to the United States, which will be costly for producers across the continent. But it did not seriously weaken digital regulation, which Europeans had greeted as a major victory.

But the deal is not final. The text itself is not legally binding, and even once the agreement is put in place, officials have indicated that it is only a first step. Both sides could bring forward additional asks.

Europeans have suggested that they plan to continue pushing for exemptions for products like wine and spirits. And it is becoming increasingly clear that Americans will continue pushing for a loosening of technology rules.

“All it takes is a single tweet from Trump to suggest that the joint statement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a research consultancy. “Both countries and the E.U.-level are at risk.”

Around the world, tech firms have faced scrutiny for not doing enough to stop the spread of disinformation, engaging in anticompetitive business practices and not paying their fair share of taxes in the countries where they operate.

Mr. Trump’s threat shows his close ties to the U.S. tech industry and willingness to defend its interests abroad. Over the past several years, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, the European Union and others have proposed or adopted laws, regulations and tax policies focused on the tech sector.

The trade measures the president is warning of could be painful for the European Union. Restrictions on computer chip exports, for instance, would harm efforts in Europe and elsewhere to build massive data centers for developing the technology.

Asked about Mr. Trump’s post at a news conference on Tuesday, Paula Pinho, an E.U. spokeswoman, declined to comment in detail on hypothetical measures. But Thomas Regnier, an E.U. spokesman, pointed out that the bloc’s digital regulations did not specifically target American companies, but applied to firms from all over the world.

The stakes are high for Europe. Officials here have long made it clear that they see their regulations as a matter of national sovereignty. Given that, bending to Mr. Trump would amount to allowing the United States to write Europe’s rules.

But E.U. officials have already made major concessions to appease Mr. Trump, accepting higher tariffs on key exports ranging from cars to medicine while promising to make major investment in American technology and energy. The trade deal has been widely greeted as a capitulation on Europe’s part.

The bloc did not have had much of a choice, however.

Although its member states are moving rapidly to increase their own defense outlays and to diversify their customer base away from the United States, the bloc is for now both militarily and economically closely intertwined with America.

Given that, Europe’s leaders have been left trying to appease Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump himself on Monday underscored the tone of recent deliberations, claiming to reporters that “they call me the president of Europe.”

The account by the whistle-blower, Charles Borges, underscores concerns that have led to lawsuits seeking to block young software engineers at the agency built by Elon Musk from having access to confidential government data. In his complaint, Mr. Borges said DOGE members copied the data to an internal agency server that only DOGE could access, forgoing the type of “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data and creating “enormous vulnerabilities.”

Mr. Borges did not indicate that the database had been breached or used inappropriately.

But his disclosure stated that as of late June, “no verified audit or oversight mechanisms” existed to monitor what DOGE was using the data for or whether it was being shared outside the agency. That kind of oversight would typically be provided by the agency’s career information security professionals, Mr. Borges said in his account.

And his complaint cites an official agency security assessment that described the project as “high risk” and that warned of “catastrophic impact” to Social Security beneficiaries and programs if the database were to be compromised.

“Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital health care and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for reissuing every American a new Social Security number at great cost,” Mr. Borges’s complaint said. He alleged that DOGE did not involve him in discussions about the project, despite his role as chief data officer, leaving him to piece together evidence of what had happened after the fact.

Included in his account, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, are more than two dozen pages of internal emails, memos and other records to document his claims. Mr. Borges’s complaint said that DOGE’s actions “potentially violated multiple federal statutes” designed to protect government data.

Lawyers at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, filed Mr. Borges’s account on Tuesday with the Office of Special Counsel as well as with congressional lawmakers. Mr. Borges, 49, joined the Social Security Administration in January after working for more than three years at other government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and serving 22 years in the Navy, according to his complaint. His lawyers declined to make him available for an interview with The Times.

A spokesman for the Social Security Administration, Nick Perrine, said that the agency took whistle-blower complaints seriously.

“S.S.A. stores all personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information,” he said. “The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a longstanding environment used by S.S.A. and walled off from the internet. High-level career S.S.A. officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by S.S.A.’s information security team.”

Mr. Perrine added that the agency was “not aware of any compromise to this environment” and remained “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Social Security Administration.

The complaint includes documents showing that DOGE leaders sought to upload the data despite warnings that they could be exposing Americans’ personal information. The documents do not reveal why DOGE pushed for the project, although Mr. Borges said he was later told that the reason was to improve the way the agency exchanged data with other parts of government.

“I have determined the business need is higher than the security risk associated with this implementation and I accept all risks,” wrote Aram Moghaddassi, who worked at two of Mr. Musk’s companies, X and Neuralink, before becoming Social Security’s chief information officer, in a July 15 memo.

Mr. Moghaddassi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DOGE’s access to Social Security data became one of the earliest flash points in Mr. Musk’s contentious spell in Washington. The billionaire and his allies pushed for DOGE to have unfettered access to the agency’s data, which is strictly protected under federal law, ousting career officials who stood in their way. Mr. Musk advanced false claims of widespread fraud at Social Security to justify the urgency of DOGE’s work.

Privacy advocates and Democrats warned that the confidentiality of Americans’ personal information might be at risk. Social Security data is highly sought after by criminals and foreign governments, who can use the information for identity theft or to gather intelligence. A federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to sensitive Social Security data in March, but the Supreme Court overruled that decision on June 6.

The agency has also shared data with immigration authorities, as President Trump seeks to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Although Mr. Musk and many of his allies left Washington after the billionaire fell out with Mr. Trump in May, members of DOGE have continued to occupy key roles in the federal bureaucracy, including Mr. Moghaddassi.

At issue in Mr. Borges’s complaint is the so-called Numident file, a critical database that contains the personal information of everyone who has ever held a Social Security number, living or dead. The agency has issued more than 548 million numbers.

In his complaint, Mr. Borges provided documents showing that DOGE member John Solly, a software engineer working at Social Security, called a career agency employee on June 10 to open discussions about copying Numident data to a “virtual private cloud” server operated by Social Security. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old DOGE software engineer, was also involved in the project and would be given access to the server, other records show. The request came shortly after the Supreme Court allowed members of DOGE to have access to the agency’s data.

Mr. Solly and Mr. Coristine did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

At least one senior official soon began raising concerns, according to documents disclosed in Mr. Borges’s complaint.

On June 16, Joe Cunningham, the agency’s acting chief information security officer, emailed Mr. Moghaddassi and another top official, attaching a copy of an official risk assessment.

“After a thorough review, we have determined that this request poses a high risk,” Mr. Cunningham wrote, adding that “our current policy requires sign-off from the chief information officer (C.I.O.) to accept these risks.”

The risk assessment stated that DOGE wanted “uninhibited” control over the server to “expedite” its work but had not provided documentation of how it would maintain security, and it warned that “sensitive data could be made public,” according to a copy included in Mr. Borges’s complaint.

In another email to colleagues on June 23, Mr. Cunningham wrote: “We need to address how we can effectively monitor the data and the security controls that will be implemented.”

Two days later, he asked Michael Russo, a senior DOGE-aligned official at Social Security, to sign off on the project, noting that the personal data being uploaded had not been “sanitized,” or anonymized, as he suggested would typically be the case.

“Approved,” Mr. Russo replied less than half an hour later.

Another Social Security employee wrote that a colleague would be “transferring a copy of the Numident data over shortly.”

Mr. Russo declined to comment. Mr. Cunningham did not immediately respond.

Mr. Borges’s complaint stated that he was kept in the dark about copying the Numident data and that his superiors did not address his concerns when he raised them this month.

And he said that after he started asking questions about the project, the agency’s Office of the General Counsel told employees “not to respond to his inquiries.”

“Mr. Borges spent weeks pressing for fixes inside” the agency, Andrea Meza, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement. “When nothing changed, he used the protected channels federal whistle-blower law provides.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint also includes documents that he said backed up two additional allegations.

He said that in March DOGE officials bypassed normal security procedures and were given “improper and excessive access” to other databases that contained sensitive information about Social Security applicants, including the ability to edit data.

Mr. Borges also said that DOGE officials briefly “appeared to have circumvented” the March 20 temporary court order that locked them out of Social Security data, regaining access to the data over the following weekend before being cut off again on March 24.

“SPD cannot and will not interfere with a federal law enforcement officer,” Hall said.
This lawsuit was based on violations of anti-discrimination and other state-level laws, not the 2018 city law, however.
Other opponents of the law argued that the city should be supportive of federal immigration officials and the White House’s deportation initiative.","Immigration officers must have a warrant to enter a permitted event on most public property in Spokane if organizers request protection and go through the proper steps to receive it, the city council voted Monday.

The law, which went through months of delays to satisfy the concerns of enough council members to pass, did not come soon enough this summer to save Tacos and Tequila, an annual event celebrating Spokane’s Latino community that would have typically taken place last weekend on a closed city street downtown but was canceled for fear of targeted raids by immigration officials.

“We just don’t feel like it’s safe right now to hold a Latino festival because we are being targeted right now,” said Fernanda Mazcot, executive director of Nuestras Raices Community Center, when the event was canceled in July.

But bill sponsor Councilman Paul Dillon and supporters hope the new law will provide some level of reassurance for future event planners and their attendees.

“Words cannot fully describe the way your blood freezes or the way your entire nervous system becomes an active live wire when you think you may have to be the person who stands against injustice and holds federal agents accountable,” said Nicole Ruiz, an organizer for Nuestras Raíces Community Center – a nonprofit serving the Latino community in Eastern Washington that hosts events like Tacos and Tequila.

“However, there is also something powerful when you know you are backed by the law,” Ruiz added. “Despite the fear, you stand a little straighter.”

The “Safe and Welcome in Spokane” law, originally proposed to impact public events in city parks, now potentially includes any event on public property outside of parks, following the independent city park board’s refusal to take responsibility for enforcement or administration. To qualify, organizers must coordinate with the city permitting office, clearly define the borders of the event with signage or barriers and give attendees “express permission” to enter, such as with a ticket or verbal permission.

The original version of the law was proposed in May as one of the last major legislative actions by former Councilwoman Lili Navarrete, who resigned in late June citing health concerns, but the proposal faltered amid concerns from the park board.

Dillon took up the effort in June shortly after mass protests over immigration arrests, modifying the law so that it no longer included city parks. The ordinance again faced headwinds after Council President Betsy Wilkerson worried it would prevent typical law enforcement from entering if a crime occurred at a protected event.

Though Dillon has insisted the law only impacts immigration officers, the law approved Monday also explicitly allows local, county and state law enforcement to enforce laws relevant to their jurisdictions.

The ordinance was approved Monday 5-2, with Councilmen Jonathan Bingle and Michael Cathcart voting in opposition. Since May, Cathcart has argued the ordinance was more performance than protection, believing that federal law enforcement would not be discouraged from entering an event in violation of the municipal law, and they may actively surveil the perimeter of events that sought such protections.

Police Chief Kevin Hall, asked Monday what officers would do in response to a 911 call about immigration officers violating the city’s law, was clear: observe, attempt to keep the peace, and otherwise do nothing.

“SPD cannot and will not interfere with a federal law enforcement officer,” Hall said.

Instead, the law would potentially give residents the ability to sue the federal government and other parties for violations, similar to a 2018 city law that prohibited warrantless immigration searches at the downtown Greyhound station.

In 2021, Greyhound agreed to a $2.2 million settlement with Washington state for frequently allowing warrantless immigration services just before the first court hearing for a lawsuit brought by then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson. This lawsuit was based on violations of anti-discrimination and other state-level laws, not the 2018 city law, however.

Cathcart disputed that cities had the power to grant residents a right to sue the federal government over alleged violations, which would leave the ordinance toothless.

Other opponents of the law argued that the city should be supportive of federal immigration officials and the White House’s deportation initiative.

“The law is clear that invaders need to be repelled,” said Larry Andrews, owner of HVAC company Andrews Mechanical and a frequent critic of the council. “And the problem with our city right now is we’re in a deficit … and by doing what you’re doing, you’re going to make it even worse, because the (federal) administration is following the laws, and they’re going to pull all of your funding for sure.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/v02UBJ2X3hJm2YVhOX6Tx016ukw=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/25/684a61d96d77f.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 16:56:34.893830

Nigel Farage's plans to tackle illegal immigration are big and would prompt a host of legal and practical challenges.","In politics the summer holidays offer a major opportunity for opposition parties.

A quieter news agenda means the chance to break through with policies.

Multiple government sources have told me that they think Reform UK has beaten both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the August battle of attracting attention.

That may have been helped by Tuesday's finale in Nigel Farage's summer crime campaign: the unveiling of the party's long-awaited illegal immigration strategy.

A couple of attendees at the news conference, at an aircraft hangar in Oxfordshire, told me what was most notable was not just the boldness of the policy but quite how much money the party had spent on the event.

""It was like a TV variety show,"" said one.

That suggests the party is continuing to attract donors - helped by opinion polls consistently suggesting that a Farage premiership is possible.

Since April, Reform has had a lead over Labour according to these surveys.

Research suggests illegal immigration is also among the top issues for voters, although there is evidence that many have a limited understanding of the balance of illegal and legal migration in the UK.

So has Nigel Farage changed the debate on immigration?

Arguably the rise in small boat crossings since 2018 has been a major factor in crystallizing voters' concerns. It is a very visible, striking, and relatively new form of illegal migration.

These arrivals make up just over a third of those claiming asylum in the UK - many others arrive on a visa and then put in a claim.

Yet the record numbers of crossings have become emblematic of wider anxiety that the asylum system is not working. And prime ministers have struggled to fix it.

Rishi Sunak tried and failed to ""stop the boats"". Keir Starmer also made a major commitment on immigration - to ""smash the gangs"".

No party seems to be arguing that people making perilous journeys across the English Channel is a good thing. And therefore the UK political debate is focussed on who can solve this issue and how.

The solutions on offer from political parties have steadily become more radical in recent months with the Conservatives now examining whether to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Labour government is promising to introduce new legislation by the end of the year to tighten the way some of that convention is used in asylum cases to prevent legal delays.

Yet Reform is undoubtedly proposing the most radical solution - including leaving the convention altogether.

Nigel Farage's plans to tackle illegal immigration are big and would prompt a host of legal and practical challenges.

In his long political career he has regularly been accused of not being interested in policy detail, and at Tuesday's news conference Farage repeatedly deferred to his colleague Zia Yusaf when questioned about Reform's policy.

The policy document handed out to attendees was just four pages long, even if a party source insisted this was just a summary of Reform's - still secret - 100 page plan.

Questions will continues to be asked about how Reform intend to deport unaccompanied children, as well as the dangers of returning people to unsafe countries like Afghanistan where they could potentially face torture or death.

Farage's response was: ""The alternative of course is to do nothing… We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2935/live/620c7ce0-829c-11f0-a21f-a946aea0c353.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 13:57:13.329496

The reason for the detainment of Utah violinist John Shin by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been revealed.

Last week, Shin’s wife Danae Snow established a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the expensive legal process required to bring him home. At the time, no details on the reason for Shin’s detention had been released.

The family has since hired the Utah law firm Stowell Crayk to help release Shin from an immigration detention facility in Aurora, UT. Snow provided an update to the fundraiser page, saying:

‘In working with the attorneys, I have learned that ICE made the decision to detain John because of an impaired driving ticket he received in 2019 while he was grieving the passing of his father from brain cancer.

‘While our attorneys feel confident that we can get him out of ICE custody on bond, I wanted to let you know as soon as I found out the reason for his being detained.

‘Of course, if this changes your mind about donating, please reach out to me for a refund.’

According to a report by Fox13 News, the attorney Adam Crayk clarified Shin’s immigration status. Crayk said that Shin originally came to the US under his father’s student visa before eventually marrying a US citizen. A family friend confirmed that Shin came to Utah from South Korea when he was ten years old.

Crayk told Fox13 that for reasons beyond their control, the family ’weren’t able to file for the green card in a timely fashion.’

Snow said that Shin was struggling with the death of his father at the time he received the impaired driving ticket, after which he completed the necessary probation.

‘He was stepping into the role of trying to take care of his family and his father’s absence and was really not knowing how to move forward and really just struggling with life without him,’ Snow said.

Shin’s citizenship paperwork has yet to be submitted, but the family and attorney are hoping to obtain Shin a green card after his bond hearing on Tuesday next week.

Snow had initially aimed to raise $28,000. As of 26 August, over $64,000 has been raised towards the fundraiser’s new goal of $70,000.

Friends and supporters of Shin have been playing their instruments at the Utah State Capitol government office and will aim to continue doing so until Shin returns home.",https://dnan0fzjxntrj.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/8/8/40288_93825967_1755708009973657_r_360847.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 13:57:28.562309

Judicial orders spark federal lawsuit

The backstory:

In a highly unusual move, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in June against the entire federal court in Maryland. The suit was in response to a standing order issued by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, which was designed to prevent the immediate deportation of immigrants who had filed petitions challenging their detentions.

This action was seen as an escalation of the administration's ongoing conflict with the judiciary over immigration enforcement.

The court's response to the lawsuit

What we know:

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who was a Trump appointee who normally sits in Virginia, was specially assigned to preside over the case. In his ruling, he dismissed the lawsuit, finding that it was an improper challenge that went against established legal precedent and the principle of separation of powers.

He stated that the administration should have used a more traditional legal process, such as appealing a decision in a specific case, rather than suing all 15 judges. Judge Cullen's decision notes that the court's standing order was a reasonable and common judicial act intended to preserve its jurisdiction and ensure that immigrants have access to legal counsel.

The lawsuit was filed in response to a ""rising tide of last-minute immigration petitions"" that made it difficult for the court to review cases, according to attorneys for the judges. The dispute highlights the conflict between the executive and the judiciary, with members of the Trump administration criticizing judges who oppose policies set forward by the administration.

The Justice Department argued that the automatic pause in deportations violated a Supreme Court ruling. In his decision, Judge Cullen also criticized the administration's public attacks on the judiciary, calling the effort to ""smear and impugn"" judges both ""unprecedented and unfortunate.""

Paul Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer and former solicitor general who represented the Maryland judges. Clement stated during the hearing that ""there really is no precursor for this suit"" and that the lawsuit was intended to ""limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.""

Local perspective:

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson told Newsweek on Tuesday: ""A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation's laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) presenting at a U.S. port of entry with criminal convictions may be found inadmissible, placed in removal proceedings, and subject to mandatory detention.""

Why It Matters

Dale Heath's future as a U.S. citizen remains in limbo due to marijuana possession charges of less than 2 ounces from approximately 25 years ago. After successfully renewing his temporary proof of residency annually since 2022, he was reportedly informed by federal authorities in May that renewal was no longer an option ""because there are changes under the new administration.""

President Donald Trump has continually vowed to remove violent offenders from American soil; however, some cases involving nonviolent immigrants lacking criminal records have resulted in broader questions of whether such individuals should be detained and/or deported.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley's Deportation Data Project, which compiles federal data, found that roughly 37 percent of ICE arrests in July 2025 were of people with no U.S. criminal convictions or pending charges, doubling to about 92,000 during the first six months of the Trump administration compared with the final half‑year of the Joe Biden administration.

That 37 percent figure is up from 13 percent during Biden's last full month in office in December.

What To Know

On August 4, Dale Heath left his home in Castle Rock, Colorado, to tend to his immigration paperwork at Denver International Airport.

After he was informed by officials that they were unable to properly renew his residency, he was detained and placed inside the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, where he called his wife, Kelli, later that day, according to local news station 9News.

""It was a very like, 'Hey, I'll be right back. I'm going to run and renew my paperwork,'"" his wife, Kelli Heath, told the outlet. ""He honestly didn't even give us a hug or kiss goodbye because it was such a routine activity to go take care of...It was like he was going to the grocery store.""

Newsweek reached out to Kelli Heath via her Facebook page for comment.

Dale Heath came to the U.S. from England in 1991, at age 8 and with a permanent visa, Kelli told CBS News Colorado. He's lived in Colorado for about a decade and, along with his wife, runs Castle Rock Carpet Care, which the couple temporarily closed following his detention. He also volunteered as a coach with Rapids Youth Soccer and served in his children's school community.

His detention stems from two arrests in the year 2001 for marijuana possession of less than 2 ounces, both occurring in Texas, including once before he was 18 years old. Court records show he pleaded no contest in both cases and served probation and short confinement.

""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time,"" Kelli told 9News. ""But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue.""

CBP told Newsweek that Heath, a United Kingdom passport holder and U.S. lawful permanent resident, had previously been found inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act due to a controlled substance violation.

""During his interaction with CBP, Heath attempted to flee after being served a Notice to Appear (NTA) for immigration court,"" they said.

Dale was initially questioned in May 2022 at Houston's Hobby Airport by Customs and Border Protection officers after returning from a trip. Initially placed in removal proceedings, he was told to renew his paperwork every year to extend his parole and remain in the country.

Now, the husband and father of two children has remained in detention for about three weeks.

""It is literally like visiting somebody in prison,"" Kelli told CBS Colorado. ""It's through a glass window. You pick up the phone and can talk to them through the phone. So it's not like I can hug him or kiss him.""

""Emotionally, he's a wreck,"" she said. ""Physically, he's a wreck. He lost 12 pounds in the first four days he was there. He's in an area where there's...I'll say real criminals in there—domestic violence, or somebody who is affiliated with a murder. It's just crazy things like that.""

Kelli set up a crowdfunding campaign on the website Free Funder. The campaign, created on August 11, has already surpassed the $10,000 funding goal ($10,751 as of Tuesday morning) and received donations from 109 individuals, including one for $1,500.

""This heartbreaking situation has left his wife and children without his support, both emotionally and financially,"" the campaign page reads. ""In the midst of this sudden separation, they are now navigating overwhelming legal expenses, household bills, and daily living costs, all while holding onto hope for his safe return home.

""The family has always been the first to help others in need, and now, they need our help more than ever.""

What People Are Saying

In a statement to 9NEWS, ICE said it ""continues to issue temporary status documentation such as I-551 stamps on a case-by-case basis,"" but would not comment specifically on Dale's case.

Kelli Heath, in an August 11 Facebook post: ""This has been devastating for us emotionally and financially. Our family business is temporarily closed, and many have asked how they can help. Right now, financial support would make the biggest difference. Even $10 helps.

""We're also setting up a meal train to help with dinners. Thank you to everyone who has checked in on us—your love and kindness mean the world. If I miss responding, please know I see and appreciate you.""

In a scathing 39-page ruling, the judge, Thomas T. Cullen, called the suit “novel and potentially calamitous,” saying that the administration had simpler — and clearly more legal — ways to contest the standing order aside from bringing a suit against all 15 federal judges who sit in Maryland.
Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature.
Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.
“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote.","A federal judge on Tuesday threw out an extraordinary lawsuit that the Trump administration had filed against the entire federal bench in Maryland, challenging a standing order intended to briefly slow down the government’s ability to deport undocumented immigrants.

Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature. Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Moreover, he used the ruling to take Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to task for having repeatedly attacked other judges who have dared to rule against the White House in a flurry of cases challenging aspects of its political agenda.

“Over the past several months, principal officers of the executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional, [c]rooked,’ and worse,” Judge Cullen wrote.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he concluded.

Judge Cullen’s plaintive criticism of the Trump administration’s assaults on the judiciary was in many ways reminiscent of a ruling issued in April by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit — for which he once served as a clerk — in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The ruling was written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, an icon of the conservative legal movement, who expressed deep concerns about the executive and judicial branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

“We yet cling to the hope,” Judge Wilkinson wrote, “that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

The case in front of Judge Cullen began in June when the Trump administration filed suit challenging a standing order put in place the month before. The order said that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country in the Maryland federal courts by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled.

The order was intended to give judges time to sort through the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent of those was a lawsuit brought in March by Mr. Abrego Garcia.

Judge Cullen pointed out in his ruling that the White House took “umbrage” with the standing order because Trump officials believed it hindered their ability “to police immigration matters and enforce the nation’s immigration laws.”

He admitted that such arguments might have gotten “traction” if the administration had made them “in the proper forum.” Trump officials, he said, could have appealed any individual cases where the standing order had actually slowed down an immigrant’s removal or could have contested the underlying validity of the blanket rule in front of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify such measures.

But instead, Judge Cullen maintained, the administration “chose a different, and more confrontational, path.”

“The executive decided to sue,” he wrote, “and in a big way.”

In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Cullen agreed with almost of all the arguments put forward at a hearing two weeks ago by a lawyer for the judges, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court.

The judge found that the defendants, as federal jurists, were immune from being sued and that the administration’s suit essentially violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution by having the executive branch attempt legal action against the judicial branch.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches — and the public officials who serve in them — share the same core sovereign interest: to support and defend the Constitution.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26dc-judges-ptgf/26dc-judges-ptgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:27.021383

Asheville Attorney James Mills was outside the courthouse and witnessed the arrest.

""I was standing over there, right by the courthouse, and happened to look over, when suddenly a gray [Ford] Expedition stopped in the middle of the street,"" Mills said. ""And at least two, maybe three armed officers in tactical gear got out and ran into the middle of the median.”

Mills said a Buncombe County bailiff was present who did not know what was happening.

After a hearing in the courthouse, Amaya-Sanchez requested a bailiff to escort him to his car. It was then that suspected ICE agents, one with a U.S. Marshal vest, arrested him.

""They clearly were coming after one person. It was a bit of a fright, with tactical gear and long guns, run towards somebody and literally just grab them,"" Mills said.

""We did not receive prior notification from ICE that they were there to detain that individual,"" said Jorge Redmond, attorney for Buncombe County Sheriff Quintin Miller. ""We were aware of federal officers' presence in the courthouse, but nothing as it relates to detaining anyone. Sheriff Miller does have safety concerns about how that apprehension transpired near the courthouse.""

Redmond said an individual with federal credentials entered the courthouse and asked about courtroom locations before the arrest outside. He confirmed ICE pulled up outside the courthouse.

""Unfortunately, no sheriff in the state of North Carolina prevents these types of situations [ICE apprehensions] from occurring in their respective counties.

Miller is asking for the same ICE notification it gets for ICE detainers in jail and warrants applicable to any potential courthouse arrest, Redmond said.

""It was shocking in that this is America,"" said Mills. ""Men with tactical vests in the middle of the road taking away a human being.""

Timothy Henderson served as Jediael Amaya-Sanchez's public defender in a jury trial, where he was found not guilty of any charges. He was also working to help his client the day he was arrested outside the courthouse.

""This victim's wife said that within 10 minutes of being acquitted by a jury of his peers, that Mr. Amaya-Sanchez attempted to run her down in the parking garage. That didn't sound like something the man I'd just spent a week with would ever do,"" he said.

Henderson said the hearing was why Amaya-Sanchez was at the courthouse. Henderson was working to get him a bilingual attorney who could help with the civil filing.

Henderson believed the allegations were false.

He added that he is concerned about the potential ICE situation and is in touch with his client's family.

""I spoke to his daughter on Friday evening,"" he said. ""She's been in touch with our office. It looked like Friday, he was in Charlotte [federal custody]. I'm not sure where he is now.""

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.
""In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,"" he said.
""ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.""","As the Trump administration seeks to implement its hardline immigration policies, it has increased enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in immigration courts, prompting alarm from Catholic immigration advocates.

Such instances are taking place across the country: New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently filed court papers in support of a lawsuit to stop arrests of migrants reporting for their hearings at a federal immigration building in Manhattan. Protesters in San Francisco attempted to halt such detentions in that city.

Near the U.S.-Mexico border, Fr. Michael Gallagher, an attorney and Jesuit priest and a member of Jesuit Refugee Service/USA's Caminar Contigo program in El Paso, has been visiting immigration court hearings to help ensure those going into their hearings understand their rights, as well as the possible outcomes of their cases.

Among the consequences ""of these arrests as people come out of court,"" Gallagher said, was a woman who had had been told by a judge to leave her children at home for her appointment followed that instruction, and later, as she ""comes to court and gets arrested as she comes out, and her kids are left at home and don't know where mama is.""

""So that is one of the kind of brutal consequences,"" he said.

Gallagher told OSV News targeting immigration courts for enforcement actions means the government is in some cases, ""arresting people who are complying with the law.""

""It's against fundamental justice,"" Gallagher said.

The Trump administration's changes to Temporary Protected Status — a program for shielding eligible migrants from particular nations from deportation due to dangerous conditions in their homelands — means that there are individuals who first entered the U.S. with legal status who have now been left without it, he said.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, ""Immigration enforcement that targets people attending court hearings is particularly troubling, because we're talking about going after people doing everything they can to regularize their immigration status by following the legal process.""

""As Americans, we value fairness and respect for constitutional rights, including due process,"" he said. ""This is why from Los Angeles to San Diego to El Paso, we've seen church leaders, women religious, priests and ordinary Catholics showing up at court to witness to the human dignity of those who are our neighbors, our parishioners and decent hardworking people.""

J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the USCCB, told OSV News, ""Targeting immigration courts can violate due process for immigrants, a basic principle of our justice system. Everyone should be able to have their day in court.""

""In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,"" he said. ""ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.""

Gallagher said, ""what I'm observing is kind of a real shift towards cruelty, which is very depressing for our country, to become a cruel place."" But he said at the same time, ""the people I meet down at the courtroom — the Catholics and the Protestants and the Jews — are very much in favor of looking at these people as people, first of all, as human beings with inherent dignity.""

In one example of his work helping to educate people about their rights in court, Gallagher said he met a family with a ""little girl who was 2 or 3 years old in a white dress, who was waiting to go to court and doing pirouettes downstairs while I'm explaining to her parents that they might get arrested, the whole family.""

Despite the circumstances, he said, he was struck by how ""she's still a 3-year-old kid and a human being, lovely with a white dress, and a happy child.""

Corbett added that as deportations ""now begin to hit local communities, we're starting to see a groundswell of statements and actions from bishops across the country speaking out in defense of human rights and advocating for essential immigration reforms.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/20250825T1015-JRS-PRIEST-IMMIGRATION-COURT-1803093%20%2813%29.jpg?h=82f92a78&itok=T3Ga9Zwz,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:49.893854

Over the past three months, the Trump administration has employed a series of legal tactics in the state to achieve a desired outcome.
The Trump administration also maneuvered within the court system, reaching an agreement to settle a lawsuit against the federal government that effectively gutted a ban on churches participating in political campaigns.
Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre and Andrew Mahaleris, an Abbott spokesperson, declined to respond to questions from ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.
Taken together, Trump’s legal strategies in Texas this summer show a win-at-all-costs mindset that is trampling on legal norms, said University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson.","On July 7, the Justice Department sent a harshly written letter threatening to sue the staunchly Republican state of Texas, notwithstanding its efforts to help elect Donald Trump and the fact that the president had singled out its leaders as key allies in his immigration crackdown.

The letter decried the congressional map previously passed by the state’s Republican-led Legislature as “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” It demanded that Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton respond the same day with a plan to comply. Otherwise, the Justice Department said, it reserved “the right to seek legal action against the state.”

Despite its adversarial tone, the letter was hardly unwelcome. In fact, it was just the opposite.

It set in motion a chain of events that gave Abbott and Paxton the political cover needed to provide Trump with exactly what he wanted: a mid-decade redrawing of district lines designed to ease that path for his party to maintain control of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections.

Republican lawmakers prioritized passage of the new political map above nearly all other legislation during the state’s second special session, including disaster preparedness and relief for victims of the July 4 flooding that killed more than 130 Texans. The new congressional boundaries, crafted to net Republicans up to five more seats, drew an immediate legal challenge from a coalition of Black and Latino voters who, on Saturday morning, alleged that it discriminates against nonwhite voters. Abbott is expected to sign it into law this week.

“The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,” Abbott said in a statement on Saturday. “I promised we would get this done, and delivered on that promise.”

The series of events is part of a larger trend this summer of the Trump administration using legal action or the threat of the courts to seemingly coerce Republican governors and other politically aligned defendants to do precisely what he wants them to do. The strategy has allowed his administration to sidestep state legislatures and Congress, according to legal experts and critics. In some cases, it has allowed red states to achieve a politically valuable goal they’d wanted all along.

In Texas, Trump has been met with state leaders who have been willing, if not eager, collaborators in carrying out his agenda.

Over the past three months, the Trump administration has employed a series of legal tactics in the state to achieve a desired outcome.

It filed a federal lawsuit and, in one day, killed a decades-old law allowing Texas students who were not U.S. citizens or permanent residents to receive in-state tuition at public colleges and universities if they met specific criteria. The move came just two days after bills to repeal the law failed to pass the state Legislature.

The Trump administration also maneuvered within the court system, reaching an agreement to settle a lawsuit against the federal government that effectively gutted a ban on churches participating in political campaigns. Trump has long opposed the ban, which he vowed to end, but the president lacked congressional support for such a move.

On redistricting, Trump used his heft within the party to force the state Legislature to redraw the typically once-a-decade political map it had approved just four years earlier, leading to a standoff with the governors of Democratic states. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed measures that will ask voters in his state to approve five new districts that would favor Democrats in direct response to Texas’ redistricting.

Trump is not the first president to use a “sue and settle” strategy.

Republicans complained bitterly about the Obama administration encouraging liberal groups and Democratic state attorneys general to file suits against the Environmental Protection Agency, which then led to the rapid adoption of consent agreements for more stringent enforcement of environmental policies than Congress was likely to pass, said Marquette University law professor Paul Nolette.

But Trump’s strategy, Nollette said, is even more aggressive.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre and Andrew Mahaleris, an Abbott spokesperson, declined to respond to questions from ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. The White House acknowledged an email seeking comment, but did not provide one.

Taken together, Trump’s legal strategies in Texas this summer show a win-at-all-costs mindset that is trampling on legal norms, said University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson. He is among several legal scholars and lawyers representing civil rights and religious liberty groups who told ProPublica and the Tribune they fear the administration’s strategy to bypass the checks provided by the legislative and judicial branches of government will cause lasting harm.

“One ought to be extremely disturbed by this thoroughly authoritarian administration,” said Levinson, who has taught constitutional law for 45 years. He added that through such initiatives, Trump is “trying to enforce the ‘Führerprinzip’ of absolute loyalty to himself, rather than to abstract constitutional norms.”

“What is truly incredible is the extent to which the GOP has fallen in line,” Levinson said.

“New level”

The first clear sign that the administration was working with the state’s Republican leadership to bypass lawmakers was its successful June 4 effort to nullify the Texas Dream Act.

The 2001 law granted in-state tuition at public colleges and universities to students who lived in the state for three years and graduated from a Texas high school, even if they were not permanent residents or U.S. citizens.

Efforts to repeal or sharply curtail the benefit for immigrant children have gone nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature, including this year. It would never have passed, or remained in place for so long, without the support of Texas Republicans, said former state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, a lead sponsor of the 2001 law. The San Antonio Democrat recalled in an interview that the law, which former Gov. Rick Perry signed, had the support of most major groups representing Texas businesses because many believed that encouraging immigrant youth to pursue higher education expands their lifelong earnings, bolsters the workforce and benefits state coffers.

On June 4, two days after the Legislature adjourned, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sued Texas in federal court in Wichita Falls. There, only one district judge sits — Reed O’Connor, a Trump appointee. Within hours, Paxton, who is charged with defending the state’s laws, joined the federal government in filing a joint motion that asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional. O’Connor, who did not respond to a request for comment about the case, quickly agreed.

Paxton’s communications office did not respond to written questions from ProPublica and the Tribune. It’s unclear if Abbott, who succeeded Perry, supported the move by Bondi and Paxton to bypass the legislative process and kill the law.

Abbott has not said a lot about the issue since his initial run for governor in 2014, and Mahaleris, his spokesperson, did not respond to questions about it. Back then, pressed by Democratic opponent Wendy Davis, who predicted that GOP lawmakers would try to repeal in-state tuition for immigrant youth and said she’d veto any such legislation, Abbott suggested he supported making some changes and left the door open to signing a repeal bill.

“Greg Abbott believes that the objective of the program is noble. But he believes the law as structured is flawed and it must be reformed,” an Abbott spokesperson said at the time.

Had the Republican-led Legislature truly been interested in repealing the law, it would have done so, said Van de Putte, who pointed to this year’s passage of a program that allows families to use taxpayer dollars to fund their children’s private school education. “I mean, they got vouchers,” Van de Putte said. “This wasn’t a policy imperative.”

Van de Putte, now a lobbyist, said that when she heard of Paxton and Bondi’s maneuver, her “heart ripped.”

On June 5, a day after the Justice Department and Paxton worked together to overturn the law, Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli exulted over the collaboration, saying that because they “were able to have that line of communication and talk in advance, a statute that’s been a problem for the state for 24 years, we got rid of it in six hours.” In audio obtained by NBC News, Kambli told GOP state attorneys general at a private gathering that the president’s legal team was “learning how to be offensive-minded” and “brought in a lot of people from state-AG world” conversant in the tactics.

The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment about Kambli’s remarks. According to NBC, a department spokesperson did not dispute that Kambli made the statements and said it was “pretty standard” for department lawyers to notify state attorneys general of federal lawsuits ahead of time.

The same day Kambli spoke to the gathering with GOP state attorneys general, Bondi and Paxton issued a joint news release celebrating the victory. Bondi praised Paxton “for swiftly working with us to halt a program that was treating Americans like second-class citizens in their own country.” For his part, Paxton said he was “proud to stand with Attorney General Bondi and the Trump Administration to stop an unconstitutional and un-American law that gave in-state tuition to illegal aliens.” In ensuing weeks, the Justice Department sought to repeat its Texas victory by filing suits challenging immigrant-tuition benefits in Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Oklahoma joined Texas in agreeing to end its benefits, while Democratic statewide officials in Minnesota and Kentucky are pushing back.

The effort was “coordinated and planned collusion to circumvent the people and Texas’ legislative process,” said Kristin Etter of the Texas Immigration Law Council, an immigrant rights advocacy group.

Marquette’s Nolette, an expert on state attorneys general, said Paxton, a three-term Republican attorney general, and Trump’s Justice Department have moved to a “new level” of using the courts to achieve favored policy outcomes. He said the collaboration between Paxton and the Justice Department is an expansion of the “sue and settle” approach that the Obama administration employed. In many of those cases, there was at least a provision of the federal Clean Air Act allowing suits against the EPA administrator for lax policing, Nolette said.

“With Paxton, however, he is working with U.S. DOJ to challenge Texas’s own laws. There are no statutes that allow, or even anticipate, this behavior,” he said.

Court tactics

Fresh off its success in dismantling the Texas Dream Act, the Trump administration moved swiftly to overturn a 71-year-old federal law banning nonprofits, including religious institutions, from endorsing political candidates.

The ban, known as the Johnson Amendment, did not specifically target religious groups, but, in the past three decades or so, evangelical churches that tend to align with the GOP have railed against it, saying it impermissibly muzzles their rights to free speech and exercise of religion.

In August 2024, the National Religious Broadcasters, the conservative group Intercessors for America, and two Texas churches — Sand Springs Church of Athens and First Baptist Church of Waskom, near the Louisiana line — sued in Tyler to overturn the Johnson Amendment’s strictures against secular nonprofits as well as churches.

On July 7, their case gained significant momentum when the Justice Department joined conservative lawyers for evangelical churches in filing a motion similar to the one used to end the Texas Dream Act. In both cases, the administration’s intervention set the stage for a consent judgment, an agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the defendants as part of a settlement submitted to the judge hearing the case.

In this instance, the Justice Department said the ban unconstitutionally prohibited nonprofit organizations from engaging in political speech and that religious leaders should be able to endorse political candidates from the pulpit. The proposed settlement of the suit, however, only applied to houses of worship.

Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the consent judgment proposed to U.S. District Judge J. Campbell “Cam” Barker in Tyler amounts to “improper collusion between … the Trump administration and some religious extremists to achieve a policy objective.” Her group supports keeping the Johnson Amendment.

Barker, a Trump appointee, is allowing interested people and groups to file amicus briefs in the case. So far, he has not adopted or rejected the agreement between the administration and the evangelical groups.

Trump, who has said he learned about the Johnson Amendment when he collected evangelical ministers’ blessings as he first ran for the White House in 2015, sought to end it through an executive order. His Capitol Hill allies also tried in 2017 to repeal the tax code’s constraint on churches’ political activity but failed to attract the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster.

Holly Hollman, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, which supports preservation of the Johnson Amendment, said that, if approved by Campbell, the consent order would amount to an end-run around Congress — and one defying most Americans’ wishes.

“The majority of Americans in poll after poll support the rule and don’t want nonprofits, including houses of worship, turned into just another partisan mechanism that divides communities,” Hollman said.

One of the leading Christian conservative lawyers trying to overturn the Johnson Amendment, Michael P. Farris, who represents the National Religious Broadcasters, pushed back on allegations of collusion.

“The answer to your question is pretty simple. This case was filed on August 28, 2024,” or before Trump reclaimed the presidency, he said. “We will not reply further,” said Farris, who played a key role in drafting Paxton’s bid to have the Supreme Court overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to The New York Times.

“We are answering no media questions until the judge rules,” he wrote in an email to ProPublica and the Tribune.

Trump’s work with state officials to reach his desired outcomes is unprecedented and dangerous, said Jim Harrington, retired founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal group that advocates for voting rights and racial and economic justice. Filing “collusive lawsuits,” such as the ones over in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants and revocation of tax-exempt status for churches that dabble in politics, and carefully selecting courts where the judges are likely to be sympathetic, lets Trump evade constraints created by the framers of the U.S. Constitution, Harrington said.

The administration’s tactics are a quick way to get around recalcitrant lawmakers but risk undermining the judiciary’s role as an independent branch of government, he said.

“Even conservative judges should raise their eyebrows about the undermining of the integrity of the judicial system that’s going on,” said Harrington, who has taught for 27 years as an adjunct law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “This is a really serious attack on our system.”

Race-Based Debates

Legal challenges to Texas’ new map have previously taken years to resolve, raising uncertainty over whether Saturday’s lawsuit will be decided before next year’s midterm election.

A decision will hinge, in part, on how the courts view an assertion by the Trump administration that the congressional map passed by the Legislature four years ago, and defended by GOP lawyers in court as race-neutral, suddenly must be changed because it paid too much attention to race.

Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that works on election- and democracy-related issues, said that the administration’s reasoning is flawed and that both the 2021 map and the new one discriminate against nonwhite voters.

The 2021 map drew intense criticism for its dispersal of nonwhite groups into districts where they’d have less influence. Dramatic gains among Texas’ Hispanic, Black and Asian American communities accounted for 95% of the state’s population growth. But lawmakers drew a map where 23 of the 38 congressional districts had white majorities, even though in the 2020 census, white and Hispanic Texans constituted roughly equal shares of the total population.

To reduce the threat to suburban GOP U.S. House members, diverse neighborhoods in Dallas and Collin counties were removed from districts that were becoming more favorable for Democrats and attached to sprawling rural districts dominated by white Republican voters.

“I’ve stated it, and I’ll state it again — we drew these maps race blind,” said the state Senate’s point person on redistricting at the time, Houston Republican Joan Huffman, who did not respond to a request for comment. “We have not looked at any racial data as we drew these maps, and to this day I have not looked at any racial data.”

During a four-week federal court trial in El Paso that ended last month, Texas officials denied practicing racial discrimination. The three judges hearing the case have delayed issuing a decision, citing the special session in Austin.

In their July 7 letter to Abbott, however, Justice Department lawyers Harmeet Dhillon and Michael Gates warned Texas to change its U.S. House map, which they said was overly biased in favor of creating districts that members of racial minorities could win.

Texas’ 2021 map for U.S. House districts has four suspect “coalition districts,” they wrote, citing three districts near Houston and one in Dallas-Fort Worth where Black and Hispanic voters combine to form a majority. In recent years, all four have been represented by Black or Hispanic Democrats.

Neither Abbott spokesperson Mahaleris, nor Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokesperson, responded to questions.

The Brennan Center’s Li disputed Dhillon and Gates’ characterization of recent rulings by federal judges. Courts haven’t forbidden states from drawing minority-coalition districts but merely stated that the Voting Rights Act doesn’t require states to proactively create them, he said.

“Given that Texas has consistently said it didn’t consider race at all in 2021, there’s certainly not a case for dismantling any of these districts.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-Greg-Abbott-1326336246.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:31.592691

‘The whole scheme stinks’ Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s Parliament.
The agreement, some Ugandans said, makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for the Ugandan government.
For Museveni, the deal with the US to accept deportees is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons”, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anticorruption group in Uganda.
The deal eases pressure on Museveni and may come with trade opportunities, said Agaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda.","Ugandans have criticised an agreement with United States President Donald Trump’s administration to receive deportees from the US, questioning the lack of approval from the East African country’s parliament and suggesting the deal is a means to ease political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni.

After facing sanctions from Washington that have targeted many government officials, including the parliamentary speaker, “Museveni will be happy” to transact with the US, said Ibrahim Ssemujju, a lawmaker who is a prominent opposition figure. “He will be asking, ‘When are you bringing them?'”

Ugandan officials have released few details about the agreement although they have stated that they prefer to take deportees of African origin and do not want people with criminal records.

However, the country is being pushed as a deportation location for high-profile detainee Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man and an El Salvador native charged with human smuggling.

Abrego Garcia has become the face of Trump’s hardline anti-immigration policies. He has an American wife and children, has lived in the US state of Maryland for years and has been under protected legal status since 2019 when a judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador because he could be harmed in his home country.

He was detained on Monday by immigration officials in Baltimore. The US Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Abrego Garcia “is being processed for removal to Uganda”.

He already has been deported as one of more than 200 people the Trump administration sent this year to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers in the US. His case remains a major flashpoint for the Trump administration in its anti-immigration crackdown. Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia was severely beaten and subjected to psychological torture in the El Salvador prison, his lawyers say.

‘The whole scheme stinks’

Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s Parliament.

He said the agreement with the US left him “a little perplexed” because Uganda is struggling to look after refugees fleeing conflicts in neighbouring countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.

The agreement, some Ugandans said, makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for the Ugandan government. But it remains unclear precisely what Ugandan authorities are getting in return for accepting deportees. Analysts speculated that Uganda is seeking better trade deals and wants to be in Trump’s good books.

Okello Oryem, the deputy minister in charge of international relations, told The Associated Press news agency that such a deal was “complete rubbish”. He made the comments a day before his permanent secretary confirmed an agreement was in place to accept individuals who are “reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin”.

Negotiators for Uganda are believed to have been reporting directly to Museveni, who has been in power in the country for four decades and who, human rights groups said, oversees a government that conducts unlawful killings, arrests of opposition members and attacks on journalists.

For much of his time in power, Museveni was widely seen as a strong US ally, especially for his support of counterterrorism operations in Somalia when he deployed troops there to fight the al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab.

But his stock in Washington has seen steep falls in recent years. Former President Joe Biden’s administration piled pressure on his government over corruption, LGBTQ rights concerns and other rights abuses, and a growing list of Ugandan officials faced sanctions.

Uganda’s LGBTQ community is facing intensified persecution after the enactment of a harsh anti-gay law two years ago, according to a report released in May by Human Rights Watch, which said Ugandan authorities have “perpetrated widespread discrimination and violence” and “spread misinformation and hatred against LGBT people” since the 2023 law was enacted.

In addition to Speaker Anita Among, a key ally of Museveni’s, Ugandan officials sanctioned by the US include the current prisons chief, a former police chief, a former deputy army commander and former government ministers.

For Museveni, the deal with the US to accept deportees is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons”, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anticorruption group in Uganda.

The deal eases pressure on Museveni and may come with trade opportunities, said Agaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.

The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.

In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.

""Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,"" he wrote. ""The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.""

Cullen said that if the Trump administration ""truly believes"" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.

""Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,"" he wrote. ""To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.""

While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.

Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the ""far less destructive"" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to ""accomplish its institutional interests.""

He echoed that position in his decision, writing that ""under normal circumstances,"" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.

""But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times — at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,"" Cullen wrote. ""It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue — and in a big way.""

In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.

""Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,"" Cullen wrote.

The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.

The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to ""preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction"" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a ""fulsome opportunity"" to present its defense.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/26/758f29a3-6d56-4d06-a74c-9c8b6cb9f834/thumbnail/1200x630/8eecd716cdbacf7071ff35308d89c674/gettyimages-2231378443.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:32.000942

The Trump administration says the Maryland court exceeded its authority and violated the law when it imposed a temporary, 48-hour freeze on deportations for any migrant who filed a petition challenging their detention.

""Like other government officials, judges sometimes violate the law,"" the Department of Justice wrote. ""This case involves an extraordinary form of judicial interference in Executive prerogatives.""

But Cullen dismissed that argument, arguing the Department of Justice would normally have appealed specific decisions in specific cases, or petitioned the judicial council to change the local rules in Maryland if it didn't like them.

In normal cases, the Justice Department defends judges when they are sued. But because it was DOJ doing the suing, the judges enlisted prominent Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush years.

""The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,"" Clement said at a recent court hearing. ""There really is no precursor for this suit.""

The judges also received backing in the form of friend of the court briefs from the Maryland State Bar Association, dozens of law firms and 11 retired federal judges.

""It was a sensible step. It's something courts do all the time,"" said Philip Pro, a retired federal judge from Nevada who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who normally sits in Virginia but was assigned the case because the Maryland judges could not participate, wrote in the ruling that filing suit against the judges was not the correct avenue with which to challenge the order.

At issue was a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that described how federal judges in Maryland should handle cases involving immigrants facing an imminent risk of deportation. The order imposes a temporary stay of deportation for two business days while a case is considered.

The Justice Department sued, saying Russell had no authority to issue such a blanket order that effectively acts as a broad injunction against government actions without any assessment of whether the individual immigrants have valid cases.

But Cullen, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, concluded that the administration would have to find another way to challenge the order instead of taking the unusual and confrontational approach of suing the judges directly.

“Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,"" he wrote.

""Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” he added.

Russell’s order was issued amid a flurry of Trump administration actions seeking to expedite deportations, sometimes without people being given the opportunity to challenge the decision.

One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country, arose in Maryland.

Cullen wrote in Tuesday's ruling that, among other things, the administration lacked legal standing to sue and the judges are immune from such a lawsuit.

He did not address the substantive question of whether Russell had authority to issue the standing order.

The ruling is in line with comments Cullen made when he heard a hearing in the case in Baltimore on Aug. 13.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations.
In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone’s home.
Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Trump’s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, the Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency’s top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

It’s surging hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year’s end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Ga. That’s a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he’s been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they’re assigned.

It’s preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency’s data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. “Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,” he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.”

It’s beefing up specialized units for high-risk situations

About eight deportation officers with military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling, “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,” Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Washington.

He said he’d like to have more such units but wouldn’t put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they’re also in the process of getting more specially armored vehicles.

It’s teaching whom agents can arrest, and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the 4th Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone’s home. Generally, when they’re seeking someone they’re trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn’t allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they’re taught that those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says, ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

The 4th Amendment doesn’t extend to someone’s vehicle, so Vitello said deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency’s lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c239083/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F57%2Fcf4b59fa434f94a8cb10f38e8127%2F9657ceed9b5041019388433ea578a4f2.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:58:07.999264

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.
“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote.
“In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.
Judicial Immunity Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.","A federal judge has dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the US district judges of Maryland over a standing order that blocked the immediate deportation of some detained persons.

US District Judge Thomas Cullen, who President Donald Trump appointed during his first term, said Tuesday past rulings lead to the conclusion that he has no choice but to dismiss the case.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.

He also said the lawsuit is “not ordinary” and that the executive branch must find other paths to raise its concerns with the standing order. He said the courts and the executive branch are each part of the sovereign US government.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches—and the public officials who serve in them—share the same core sovereign interest: To support and defend the Constitution.”

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

Deportation Fights

The Trump administration filed the suit in June against the court over a standing order that blocked for two business days the deportations of detained persons who filed habeas petitions.

The order was issued amid the administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement, and a Maryland US district judge’s handling of a lawsuit from a wrongly deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The administration initially said it couldn’t return Garcia after he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an earlier immigration court ruling against his removal. But he was brought back to the United States to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he’s pleaded not guilty to. Abrego Garcia was again taken into custody by immigration officials on Monday, and is seeking to block any deportation.

Cullen said he can “appreciate” the administration’s concern that the Maryland court “encroached on its duty to police core matters of immigration.”

But he said a dispute between the judiciary should be “resolved within the constitutional structure and with due respect for the Judiciary’s co-equal standing with the executive branch,” and that he has to first ensure he has the constitutional authority to preside over the lawsuit. “In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity

Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.

He also said the district court has sovereign immunity from the case, and that the individual judges and court officials named in the litigation have judicial immunity because it was tied to an act done in their “judicial function.”

Cullen further found there was no cause of action that allowed him to hear the lawsuit between the two branches, “and this court will not be the first to create one.”

He said the administration could’ve challenged the standing order at the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, or by petitioning the Fourth Circuit’s Judicial Council.

“The Executive acknowledges these routes are available, but it claims it chose an interbranch lawsuit because those routes are inconvenient,” Cullen wrote. “This purported inconvenience does not warrant the judicial branch’s infringement on the legislative branch’s prerogative of deciding the scope of cases federal courts may review.”

‘Not Normal Times’

The unprecedented litigation came as the administration has assailed judges who’ve ruled against its policies, with Trump even calling for impeachment and some House Republican allies filing articles of impeachment against some jurists. Chief Justice John Roberts and other top federal judges have pushed back against the use of impeachment as a response to unfavorable court rulings.

Cullen referenced the harsh rhetoric in his opinion, saying the “concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

He said that typically, the administration could’ve raised its challenged under other options laid out by Congress.

“But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,” Cullen wrote, referring to the courts. “It’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0e9cbce/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F3a%2Fd4feebac4c4bb995f95b5fb23ec3%2Fjustice-sarah-silbiger.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:32.763291

Ibarra, Kristen Hwang, Kristen Hwang Health",,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/immigration-hospitals-workers-fear/,"Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.
One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.
“What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.” Workers say additional training can help Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace.
“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said.
“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”","Federal immigration agents are more routinely showing up at California medical facilities as the Trump administration ramps up deportations.

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it’s police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients’ rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn’t necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient’s privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what’s wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in ‘precarious’ situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/071725-Dignity-Health-Glendale-Memorial-Hospital-ICE-CM-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:53.704446

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

The White House had no immediate comment.

Cullen was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020. He serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies.

Cullen expressed skepticism of the lawsuit during a hearing in August. He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.

Signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

The lawsuit was an extraordinary legal maneuver, ratcheting up the administration’s fight with the federal judiciary.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” attorney Paul Clement said during the hearing. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit to fight those removal efforts until a court has heard his claim for protection, stating that the U.S. could place him in a country where “his safety cannot be assured.”

The new lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Crowd yells ‘shame!’

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Roughly 200 people gathered and prayed before the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore. Some held signs with messages such as “Stop Detaining Our Neighbors” and “Free Kilmar.”

With Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: “The people united will never be defeated.”

The crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled “Shame!”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office that Abrego Garcia “will no longer terrorize our country.”

But Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration’s removal attempts.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

What’s next?

Sandoval-Moshenberg told reporters Monday afternoon that Abrego Garcia’s lawyers don’t know when he will have a reasonable fear interview, where he should be able to express his fear of persecution or torture in the country where the U.S. wants to send him. Officials have said it’s Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have raised concerns about human-rights abuses in Uganda as well as his limited English-speaking skills in a country where the national language is English. But there are also unanswered questions about whether he could be imprisoned or sent on to El Salvador. A judge blocked the U.S. from sending Abrego Garcia back in 2019 because he faces credible threats from gangs there.

Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

“We don’t know whether Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell, much less whether they are going to let him stay,” the attorney said.

If immigration officials determine that Abrego Garcia lacks a reasonable fear of being sent to Uganda, he should be able to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said that’s the process when someone is slated for deportation to their native country. And he said it should be for third-country deportations as well.

“We don’t even know if the government agrees with that,” he said. “This is all so very new and unprecedented. … We will see what the government’s position on that is.”

Sandoval-Moshenberg also said Abrego Garcia informed ICE over the weekend that Costa Rica was an acceptable country of removal because he had “received assurances from Costa Rica that they would give him refugee status, that he would be at liberty in that country, and that he will not be re-deported onto El Salvador.”

The notice to ICE was separate from the criminal case in which Abrego Garcia declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

“Costa Rica is not justice,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “It is an acceptably less-bad option.”

Reunion with family

Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

‘Hold Abrego Garcia accountable’

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, calling it an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-25T135314Z_1484710839_RC2CEGAK45I7_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-ABREGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:57.122542

Today's top stories

Immigration authorities yesterday morning took Kilmar Abrego Garcia into federal custody, where he is waiting to find out how long he will remain in the U.S. The Maryland man was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and later returned to the U.S. The U.S. government now says it will deport Abrego Garcia again — this time to Uganda. In yesterday's court hearing, federal Judge Paula Xinis said it is ""absolutely forbidden"" to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. without giving him the chance to challenge the deportation in court.

🎧 Abrego Garcia's detention has been one of the first high-profile immigration cases of the Trump administration's crackdown, NPR's Jasmine Garsd tells Up First. At the core of his case are questions about due process for undocumented immigrants. Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador illegally in 2011 to escape gang death threats. He has not been convicted of any crimes since coming to the U.S., but the Trump administration accuses him of being a member of the MS-13 gang. He has denied this claim. In 2019, an immigration court ruled that he couldn't be deported back to El Salvador.

President Trump took steps to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook yesterday. This action marks the latest escalation in his efforts to exert control over the central bank, which he has been pressuring to lower interest rates for months. The Federal Reserve is meant to operate independently from political influence by the White House, so Trump's decision may face legal challenges. Bill Pulte, who oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accused Cook of making false statements on a mortgage application in 2021, before she joined the Fed.

🎧 Pulte says that Cook applied for home loans on two properties just weeks apart, in two different states, stating that each home would be her primary residence. NPR's Scott Horsley says that this would lead to more favorable loan terms. Trump expressed that he does not have confidence in Cook's integrity, and that was cause to remove her. Cook says the president doesn't have the authority to fire her, and she will continue to carry out her duties as Fed governor. If Trump succeeds in ousting Cook, it would create a vacancy that he could fill with someone more aligned with his interests.

The president is vowing to punish Washington, D.C., and other locations across the country for abolishing cash bail. Washington hasn't had cash bail since 1992. The driving force behind the decision was that cash bail disproportionately affects poor Black people who are stuck in jail until trial. Trump's announcement comes as he looks to expand his weekslong military intervention in the nation's capital. He also expressed his hope to expand the National Guard's role in policing.

🎧 Trump says that the bail system has let murderers easily walk free. This is extremely rare, as just 4% of all people released before trial last year in the nation's capital were accused of violent crimes, says Alex Koma of NPR network station WAMU. Many people in Washington doubt that what Trump wants to do is legal, and only Congress can overturn D.C. laws. Local leaders are on edge due to the president's ongoing meddling in the city's affairs. Trump has expressed that he wants to train a special National Guard unit dedicated to public safety in D.C. He has command of the guard in the capital, because it is not a state.

Living better

Living Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.

Wearing sunscreen is essential health advice, but many standard sprays and creams miss an important benefit. Over the last decade, more research has focused on hyperpigmentation and melasma. Though ultraviolet radiation doesn't solely cause these conditions, evidence shows that radiation from visible light, which penetrates the skin more deeply than UV rays, can contribute to them. Tinted sunscreens, which contain pigments to match a range of skin tones, block visible light radiation. According to research published in the journal Photodermatology, Photoimmunology & Photomedicine, tinted sunscreens provide better protection against damage from visible light compared to non-tinted products. Here's what to look for on the label.

☀️ The number one ingredient in visible light protection is the chemical compound iron oxide. It provides tinted sunscreen with its color, and is commonly used to lend a skin-toned hue to concealer and foundation.

☀️ A concentration of around 3% iron oxide in sunscreen likely provides the best protection, says Dr. Jenna Lester, associate professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco. She notes that sunscreens that are white or off-white in color likely don't contain sufficient levels of the compound.

☀️ Tinted titanium dioxide does a good job of scattering visible light. Additionally, antioxidants such as vitamin C may help protect against visible light.

☀️ If you cannot find a tinted sunscreen in a shade you like, consider using a foundation with iron oxide, and apply non-tinted sunscreen under it.

Earlier this month, two 15-year-olds in Washington, D.C., were arrested for beating up a man in what is said to have been an attempted carjacking. He was not just any man, but a member of a high-profile Trump initiative. Infuriated, the president lashed out at the city's Democratic leaders.

But because D.C. has an unusual relationship with the federal government, he could do more than complain. And he did: He took over the city's police department (at least temporarily), redeployed federal agents and brought in National Guard troops. Former Fox News personality and current U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, whose office prosecutes adults charged with serious crimes, complained that more kids — or ""young punks"" as she put it — need to be prosecuted for more crimes at younger ages, even as young as 14.

I've seen this movie before — in fact, I've made this movie before. I was part of a team that reported and produced a documentary on juvenile justice for the PBS series FRONTLINE that first aired in January 2001. That was a time when more and more states were moving juvenile offenders into adult systems. The thing is, then and now, that this happened at a time when crime rates, including among youth, were actually falling … but stats aren't driving this train. There is something about kids who do serious crime that just hits differently.

I can tell you from personal experience that when you see these kids in a lockup, no matter how tatted up or hard they try to look, they look like kids — kids who should be worrying about acne, prom and their SATs, not guns, jacking cars and stickups. The question then, as now, is what should happen when they have gotten into that life? What are we actually trying to accomplish? To get them on the right track or just get them out of sight? Then, as now, it seems we still haven't decided.

The 30-year-old El Salvador native is facing the possibility of being deported to Uganda after he was detained by immigration officials in Baltimore on Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security shared a video of him shuffling through the ICE Field Office in the moments after he was detained.

“He doesn’t belong here. He won’t be staying here. America is a safer nation without this MS-13 Gangbanger in it. Good riddance,” DHS wrote alongside the footage.

The clip quickly exploded online after Abrego Garcia, who was released from a Tennessee jail last week as he awaits trial on human smuggling charges, uttered “it’s a corrupt government” as an ICE agent led him away.

“Kilmar is nothing but a petulant child,” one person reacted on X.

Others were quick to point out the “absolute irony” of him slamming the Trump administration.

“So corrupt he still wants to stay here,” one X user wrote.

“He has the gall to mutter ‘corrupt govt.’ Criminals don’t get to call anyone else corrupt,” another raged.

Abrego Garcia’s arrest comes after the Trump administration mistakenly shipped him off to his native El Salvador back in June.

He was subsequently brought back to face criminal charges of transporting migrants living in the US illegally, tied to a 2022 traffic stop during which the construction worker was pulled over on a Tennessee highway with eight passengers in the car, but no luggage.

Abrego Garcia, who has insisted he’s not a gangbanger, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on bond last Friday.

His lawyers have claimed US officials offered to send him to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea – or risk being deported to Uganda.

“They’re holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,” his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “They’re weaponizing the immigration system in a way that’s completely unconstitutional.”

The feds detained him again at the ICE office in Baltimore after reporting for a scheduled interview on Monday.

He has since been sent to a detention facility in Virginia.

“Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer.”

His lawyers quickly filed a lawsuit seeking an order for him not to be deported anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there.

During a court hearing on Monday afternoon, US District Judge Paula Xinis said she planned to hold additional court proceedings on the administration’s plan to deport him to Uganda.

The judge barred the government from removing him until such a hearing could be held.

If deported, Sandoval-Moshenberg has argued they need assurances that Abrego Garcia won’t be sent back to El Salvador amid fears of persecution.

“We don’t know if Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

The lawyer said Abrego Garcia had notified the US government he would be willing to accept deportation to Costa Rica since the country had said it would provide him with refugee status.

He didn’t say whether he’d agree to plead guilty to the criminal charges he’s facing.

Unveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative Oxford press conference, Farage claimed his party would detain and deport “absolutely anyone” arriving by small boat and ensure they are “never, ever allowed to stay”, insisting this would stop crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”.

Pressed by reporters, Farage confirmed that women and children would also be detained under the plans, conceding that “how we deal with children is a more complicated and difficult issue” but insisting all arrivals would be subject to removal.

Farage dodged questions repeatedly about how the scheme would work in practice. He was unable to name a single RAF base to be converted into secure detention facilities, despite insisting they would be central to his plans.

He offered no detail on how Reform would secure deportation agreements with countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, many of which have no return treaties with the UK and are considered unsafe by British courts. Farage could not explain how Reform’s scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of independent estimates.

Reform’s leadership said it would repeal the Human Rights Act, leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR), and disapply the 1951 refugee convention and UN convention against torture, with senior party figure Zia Yusuf declaring that “no lawyer and no judge” would be able to prevent deportation flights from leaving.

George Peretz KC, the chair of the Society of Labour Lawyers, said: “The Reform party’s policy is simply not rooted in reality. They want to institute a mass deportation programme with no real, or workable, idea of where people would be deported to.

“Reform’s policy would require a returns policy to be negotiated with regimes such as the Taliban and Iran, and may, by their own admission, involve paying those regimes to do so. Which is impractical and extremely concerning, as well as unlawful (as our own courts ruled in the Rwanda case).”

Kolbassia Haoussou, the director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, called the plans “a gift to repressive regimes” and said Britain would be abandoning one of humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. He said: “This is not who we are as a country.

“Men, women and children are coming to the UK looking for safety. They are fleeing the unimaginable horrors of torture in places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. These laws were created in the aftermath of the second world war to protect us all. If Britain were to abandon this legacy it would hand repressive regimes around the world a gift and undermine the promise to defend our shared right to live a life free from torture.”

The human rights lawyer Adam Wagner KC said Reform’s promises were not only “legally extreme” but fundamentally misleading.

“A lot of the rights contained in the European convention come from British common law: the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and the right not to be tortured,” he said.

Politicians swiftly challenged the scale and practicality of the plans.

Downing Street accused Farage of not being “serious” about his plans to deport asylum seekers, saying that leaving the CfhrECHR would undermine peace in Northern Ireland.

The prime minister’s spokesperson criticised the Reform leader on Tuesday, saying that any plan that required leaving the ECHR was bound to fail.

“The ECHR underpins key international agreements on trade, security and migration – and the Good Friday agreement,” Downing Street said. “Anyone who is proposing to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement is not serious.”

No 10 refused, however, to criticise other elements of Farage’s speech, including his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge”, as well as his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major civil disorder”.

Asked about those comments, the spokesperson said: “We have to recognise the strength of feeling about this and the pressure that it puts on public services. That’s why we are taking the serious, practical action to address this issue, and not just returning back to the old gimmicks, the old slogans that failed to deal with this and left us with the crisis that we currently face.”

Pushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, as Farage has suggested, Downing Street said: “We’re not going to take anything off the table in terms of striking returns agreements with countries around the world.”

Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Farage’s plan crumbles under the most basic scrutiny. The idea that Reform is going to magic up places to detain hundreds of thousands of people and deport them to countries who haven’t agreed to take them is taking the public for fools. Of course, Nigel Farage wants to follow his idol Vladimir Putin in ripping up the human rights convention. Winston Churchill would be turning in his grave.”

Farage claims the programme would deport up to 600,000 asylum seekers in a single parliament, yet the costings remain opaque.

A report by the Centre for Migration Control, which produced costings alongside the MP Rupert Lowe but is not led by him, estimated a near-identical mass deportation scheme would cost £47.5bn more than five years. Farage insists his plan would provide the same scale of removals for £10bn, but offered no operational blueprint or independent evidence to support the claim.

Farage argued that “over three-quarters” of small-boat arrivals were “young undocumented males” from “cultures entirely different from ours” who were “unlikely to assimilate” and “pose a risk to women and girls”, language likely to draw criticism from equality groups and anti-racism campaigners.

He also spoke of a “genuine threat to public order” if his proposals were not adopted, framing his plan as the only bulwark against rising anger and “civil disorder”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8750ba16c4f388e45d26569c51d06fe59af756a2/280_0_4310_3448/master/4310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2d0b58dca08832fd0a7df3b55adf002",N,,2025-08-26 10:57:21.669202

Friends of John Shin, a Utah violinist who was detained by ICE one week ago, are planning on playing their instruments in the rotunda until he’s home.

“It was a shock to hear that it was John,” said Shin’s friend Nicole Marriott Fullner, who was playing the oboe Monday at the Capitol. ""He is probably the last person that I would have expected that to happen to.”

“I want all of the state representatives and the council members and anybody who happens to be walking by to know about what's happening in their own state,” said Shin’s friend Gabriel Gordon, who was playing the violin.

While the pleasant sounds echoed through the Capitol, Shin's wife, Danae Snow, was going through a nightmare of her own.

“I can't sleep. I can't eat. It's been really hard to know that he's going to be struggling in the facility in Aurora and hoping that there is a life for him to come back to,” she said through tears.

Shin’s attorney, Adam Crayk, was able to clarify Shin’s immigration status.

“He came in under his father's student visa originally, has married a United States citizen, and for some reasons that were kind of beyond the control of theirs, weren't able to file for the green card in a timely fashion,” he said.

Crayk was able to reveal the reason why Shin was detained.

“There is an impaired driver conviction from 2020, which, for all of our purposes, he successfully completed probation. He did everything he was asked to do. He has the certificates to prove it,” he said. ""But that does make, currently, anybody that has that type of a conviction, they become a priority for immigration.”

Snow said at that time, Shin was struggling with the death of his father.

“He was stepping into the role of trying to take care of his family and his father's absence and was really not knowing how to move forward and really just struggling with life without him,” Snow said.

Crayk said no citizenship paperwork has been submitted yet, but they are hoping to get Shin a green card after his bond hearing next week.

“Do I wish that they would have filed a long time ago? Yes. Did circumstances allow for that? No. Do they now? Yes. Does that change the facts of the case? Nope,” Crayk said.

Snow has since been able to talk to Shin and said he’s coping the best he can.

“He still hasn't got a pillow, and he just wishes he could be home, and so do we,” Snow said.

“I wanted the world to see what an incredible husband and father and person he is, and he's not perfect,” Snow added. ""I wish he wouldn't have made this mistake. I know that we've been doing everything that we can to make it right, and I hope that as I've been able to forgive him, I hope that our community can too.""

In the meantime, violins will continue to play in the Capitol as his loved ones await his return home.

""John, if you're listening to this, I'm sorry. I should have warmed up before,” Gordon joked while playing the violin. ""We're all here for you, and hopefully we'll see you when you get back, very, very soon.""

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ditched the Conservative administration’s flagship plan to send migrants who arrived by unauthorized means to Rwanda.","LONDON (AP) — Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s hard-right Reform UK party, said Tuesday that if he wins the next election he will leave the European Convention on Human Rights and immediately detain and deport anyone who arrives in the country illegally, including children.

Farage laid out his plans to tackle illegal immigration following a significant rise in the number of migrants who arrive by boats across the English Channel, and weeks of protests over the government’s use of hotels to house asylum-seekers.

“If you come to the U.K. illegally, you will be detained and deported and never, ever allowed to stay, period,” Farage told a press conference.

“The mood in the country around this issue is a mix between total despair and rising anger,” he added, claiming there is now “a genuine threat to public order” if no action is taken.

He said the issue of “how we deal with children is much more complicated,” but added: “Women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained.”

Despite holding just four of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, Farage ‘s party has gained momentum by seizing on public frustration over successive governments’ inability to bring down the number of migrants coming by boat. National polls have suggested that support for Reform equals or surpasses that of the ruling Labour Party and the Conservatives.

Farage, who has long sought to link problems such as public healthcare and housing to migrant arrivals, reiterated his stance that the U.K. is being “invaded” by migrants. He said he would introduce policies to mass deport hundreds of thousands of people over the first five years of being in government.

Reform will leave the ECHR and repeal or “disapply” all other rights treaties to bar all asylum claims and ensure migrants who arrive without authorization are deported, he added. It will scale up the capacity of detention facilities and secure deals with countries including Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran, to return migrants.

Asked about the prospect of asylum-seekers being tortured or killed if they were sent back to countries they fled from, Farage said: “The alternative is to do nothing ... We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.”

Almost 29,000 people have crossed the English Channel by boat so far in 2025, up about 50% from the same period last year. On Monday, 659 migrants arrived in the U.K. by boat.

A much larger number of people — over 111,000 — applied for asylum in the U.K. in the year up to June, official figures show.

Reform’s deportation plans echo similar tough migration policies by Germany, which deported dozens of Afghan men to their homeland last month.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ditched the Conservative administration’s flagship plan to send migrants who arrived by unauthorized means to Rwanda. Instead, he has pinned hopes on a deal agreed with France last month to send some migrants who cross the English Channel on dinghies and inflatable boats back to France.

U.K. officials have suggested the “one in, one out” plan is a major breakthrough, despite the initial program involving a limited number of people.

The government is also looking to speed up the processing of asylum claims. Officials have housed tens of thousands of migrants awaiting their asylum outcome in hotels at public expense — a controversial policy that has long simmered but tipped into protests in recent weeks after a hotel resident allegedly tried to kiss a 14-year-old girl and was charged with sexual assault. The man has denied the accusation.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/9b562f5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7259x4083+0+378/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fa7%2Fc3%2F9bc1241f6e707fdc18a482a956e8%2F42183606cd66463c83f25cb6e63fdd18,N,,2025-08-26 10:57:26.135026

During the four years William Murcia Henao owned Sabores De Mi Tierra — literally, “flavors of my land” — his West Side Colombian restaurant was celebrated.

Opened in 2021, the Niagara Street eatery quickly earned local media attention, praise from a local blogger and a nomination for a state Business Council award from Assemblymember Jonathan Rivera. The restaurant won particular acclaim for its traditional Colombian dishes, which Rivera and others said was missing from Buffalo.

But then, in May, Murcia Henao was deported to Colombia, part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Several months later, his wife and two children, including one born in the United States, opted to follow him via a self-deportation process.

Murcia Henao, his wife and their eldest daughter had arrived in the United States as asylum seekers and were permitted to live and work in the Buffalo area as their case wound its way through the courts. A panel of federal judges rejected their asylum bid earlier this year.

“They were the true meaning of hard-working people, living the American dream, coming here, opening a business, you know, paying their taxes on time, no criminal record whatsoever,” said Katherine Gomez, a legal representative for the family.

Gomez and Rivera’s staff both attempted to intervene with immigration officials, but to avail.

“We did beg ICE, and we did provide a bunch of documentation stating that these people pay taxes on time. They didn’t care, and it was devastating,” Gomez said.

Murcia Henao’s wife, Adriana Botina Rodriguez, while free, was stuck in the family’s Orchard Park home, under surveillance by a black SUV — a hallmark of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She and her children had to sneak to New York City and back under cover to obtain the needed travel documents so they could leave the country without being detained, Gomez said.

The family has since reunited in Colombia. Gomez, meanwhile, purchased the business from Murcia Henao. She’s reopened the restaurant and is working to renovate it. She’s also working to bring a branch of her legal services nonprofit, La Victoria Foundation, to the Hispanic Heritage center currently under construction several blocks away on Niagara Street.

Gomez and Rivera both said the story of the Sabores restaurant highlights the new reality of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration: Law-abiding migrants are now targeted by authorities, leaving their families, businesses and communities at risk, too.

“All this is, is loss,” Rivera said. “It’s children being taken away from their parents. It’s haphazard and chaotic. It’s truly destroying communities.

Had Gomez not purchased the restaurant, he said, “we would have just had an empty storefront on Niagara Street. And who benefits from that?”

A failed asylum bid

Murcia Henao and his family arrived in the United States in 2014, fleeing threats from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC. In court filings, the family said the paramilitary group began targeting Murcia Henao’s brother in 2013 “for working for a hydroelectric dam project that the FARC opposed.” When the soldiers couldn’t locate his brother, Murcia Henao and his wife became their target.

“[Murcia Henao] testified that a man came into a clothing store where he worked, pointed at him, said ‘I found what I was looking for,’ and after buying clothing, said that he knew Murcia Henao’s brother, and that Murcia Henao had two daughters,” federal judges wrote in a filing in his deportation case.

Murcia Henao further alleged that FARC members left a condolence card at his home with a note that read, “We have one of these for each of your family.”

The family also faced extortion from local gangs, Gomez said, who wanted a percentage of the money he earned as a business owner. Eventually, she said, the family couldn’t keep up with the payments.

“So he closed his business, moved to another city, and still they were looking for him, looking for his family,” she said.

The family landed in New York City and lived and worked there before ultimately relocating to Orchard Park. Rivera said Murcia Henao has a brother who lives in the area. There, eldest daughter Salome played flag football and junior varsity basketball. Murcia Henao opened Sabores De Mi Tierra in 2021.

That same year, court records show, an immigration judge in Buffalo denied his application for asylum. Under past administrations, however, such a ruling didn’t mean immediate detention, and Murcia Henao was allowed to pursue appeals of his case as a free man. His restaurant flourished as he did.

Murcia Henao, however, lost before the Board of Immigration Appeals. In early 2023, he appealed his case to a panel of federal judges. His case languished for nearly two years. After a flurry of paperwork filed in 2023, records show, the case sat idle until Trump administration lawyers took over in February.

In March, judges in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Murcia Henao. Citing a 2016 peace accord between the Colombian government and the FARC soldiers, they argued conditions in the country were now safer than they were and that Murcia Henao had failed to demonstrate that he and his family would be persecuted if forced to return. The panel argued that “occasional flare ups of FARC violence” were not enough evidence to prove the family would be at imminent risk.

He was detained by ICE agents in mid April.

After several months in ICE custody, first in Batavia and then at a facility in Louisiana, Murcia Henao was deported to Colombia. Gomez described the detention conditions as “bad” and said his wife and children wanted to avoid detention if possible.

That meant they had to travel surreptitiously to New York City. Gomez said she arranged for the family to leave home at 2 a.m., drive to the city, acquire the needed paperwork, and arrive back home in Orchard Park undetected by the agents parked near their home. They departed for Colombia shortly thereafter, unable to sort out their affairs before they left.

“They left with nothing. They didn’t take all of their clothes or their furniture or their anything,” Rivera said. “They have to start from scratch, despite having a profitable business here.”

Future of the restaurant

After the family arrived in Colombia, Gomez said, Murcia Henao attempted to sell the restaurant. But knowing he had been deported, prospective buyers tried to take advantage of him, making only low-ball offers, Gomez said.

Running out of options, Murcia Henao agreed to sell for $30,000. He was to be paid $10,000 up front and $20,000 after the new owners took over the space. According to Gomez, they stiffed on the second payment.

Murcia Henao, she said, called her from Colombia, not knowing what to do.

“Then I told them, ‘Well, how much is it?’ And he was, you know, he was very shy,” she said. “[I said] ‘Well, let me make calls, make a loan, and I’ll buy it.’”

She did so for $55,000.

Gomez has big plans for the restaurant, which reopened July 18.

First came new flooring. Next up are repairs to the ventilation system. Gomez wants to update the menu, too, and open for breakfast. By the fall, she said, she plans to offer traditional Colombian coffee, croissants and eggs.

She’s also in talks, she said, to open a branch of her legal services nonprofit, La Victoria Foundation, down the block. Assisting Murcia Henao, she said, made her realize that many Latinos here don’t know their rights. Among other work, she wants to host “know your rights” trainings at the restaurant.

“I think people in Buffalo have no clue in regards to how immigration works,” she said. “I want them to know: These are your rights, and this is how you can have successful goals.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6026-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:05.754011

Enhance your search results with the following special search methods. These tools allow you to fine-tune what data is returned and how it’s matched.

Exact Match ("""")

Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase or sequence of words:

Example: ""Marketing manager in London""

This will return results that match exactly what’s inside the quotes — word-for-word and in order.

If there are no exact matches, the system will fall back to your default search query (which can be configured separately).

OR Search (|)

Use the pipe symbol (|) to search for any of the listed terms:

Example: Marketing manager | Sales manager | Business manager

This will return any result that matches at least one of the terms. If only one term matches, only that result is shown. If multiple match, all are returned.

Exclude Words (-)

Use the dash (-) to exclude specific words from the search results:

Examples: Marketing manager -indeed.com

Houses in London -zoopla -terraced

This tells the search engine to omit any result that includes the excluded words (e.g., no listings from Zoopla or containing ""terraced"").

Fallback Match (LIKE %query%)

Use this method when no other matching methods succeed.

Example: %economy in 2025 snp stocks%

This functions like a SQL LIKE query — it's a broad, fuzzy match that tries to find results containing the key terms anywhere in the content. It's often used as a final fallback option.

AND Search (&)

Use the ampersand (&) to ensure all terms are included in the results:

Example: Sales & Marketing & London

Only results that contain all three keywords — “Sales”, “Marketing”, and “London” — will be returned.

Even if a page is titled “Sales & Marketing”, it will still be included, as long as all keywords are present somewhere in the content.

Welcome to The Logoff: A federal judge is standing in the way of the Trump administration’s plan to once again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia — this time to Uganda.

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia? Abrego Garcia became one of the most high-profile victims of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after he was wrongfully deported to CECOT, a megaprison in El Salvador, earlier this year. The Maryland resident and Salvadoran citizen was returned to the US in June to face questionable criminal charges in Tennessee after Trump officials resisted his return for months.

What just happened? On Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Abrego Garcia after he appeared at an immigration check-in in Baltimore just days after being released from jail, and the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to deport him. Hours later, a district court judge in Maryland ordered DHS to suspend deportation proceedings pending a hearing later this week, where Abrego Garcia’s lawyers will have a chance to argue that he fears persecution if deported to Uganda.

Why Uganda? As part of its effort to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has struck deals with a number of countries, including Uganda, to accept US deportees from unrelated third countries. In Abrego Garcia’s case specifically, his lawyers allege the threat of deportation is coercive. They say the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he agreed to plead guilty to the charges he is still facing in Tennessee — and to Uganda if he refused.

What about the criminal charges? Abrego Garcia is currently facing federal criminal charges of human smuggling in connection with a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. The indictment alleges connection with a broader human smuggling ring, but there’s reason to be skeptical, as a veteran federal prosecutor in Nashville resigned over the decision to bring the charges in the first place.

What’s the big picture? Abrego Garcia’s initial deportation was entirely DHS’ mistake, but it’s hard to avoid the sense that the Trump administration is attempting to punish him for it nonetheless by bringing criminal charges and threatening re-removal to an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous third country.

And with that, it’s time to log off…

At the Aurora detention facility, Kelli said her husband has lost 12 pounds in his first four days and is struggling emotionally.","CASTLE ROCK, Colo. — Dale Heath left his Castle Rock home on Aug. 4 for what his wife thought would be another routine trip to renew his immigration paperwork. By that afternoon, he was calling from the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility to say he would not be coming home.

“It was a very like, ‘Hey, I’ll be right back. I’m going to run and renew my paperwork,’” his wife, Kelli Heath, recalled. “He honestly didn’t even give us a hug or kiss goodbye because it was such a routine activity to go take care of... It was like he was going to the grocery store.”

Dale, 42, immigrated from England in 1991 and has lived in Colorado for nearly a decade. He and his wife run Castle Rock Carpet Care, which they temporarily closed after his detention. He also volunteered as a coach with Rapids Youth Soccer and served in his children’s school community.

The family said the detention stems from two marijuana possession charges in Texas more than 20 years ago, when Dale was 18.

""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time. But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue,"" Kelli said.

According to Department of Homeland Security records reviewed by 9NEWS, Dale was questioned by Customs and Border Protection officers at Houston’s Hobby Airport in May 2022 while returning from a trip. During that sworn statement, he confirmed two arrests for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana in 2001. Court records show he pleaded no contest in both cases and served probation and short confinement.

CBP officers confiscated his green card at that airport and placed him in removal proceedings. Since then, Dale has been required to renew temporary proof of residency each year while waiting for an immigration court date.

Kelli said that at his most recent appointment this month, officials told him that “because there are changes under the new administration… they weren’t able to renew it this time around.”

He was taken into ICE custody on the spot and has been held at the detention facility Aurora for three weeks now.

The impact has been immediate.

“It’s been different in multiple ways. We’ve had to temporarily close our business,” Kelli said.

She is now caring for their 9-year-old son Oliver and 12-year-old daughter Zooey alone.

Zooey said the hardest part is starting middle school without her dad.

""Everything's not good, I'll say that,"" Zooey said. ""There's a couple times I've gone to school and started crying.""

Kelli described her son’s reaction as devastating.

“Especially with Oliver, I’ve never seen him cry like that before, and that’s heartbreaking to a mother,"" she said.

At the Aurora detention facility, Kelli said her husband has lost 12 pounds in his first four days and is struggling emotionally.

“Mentally, he’s awful, I mean, to say the least. He’s going to have PTSD from this,"" she said.

In a statement to 9NEWS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it “continues to issue temporary status documentation such as I-551 stamps on a case-by-case basis,” but would not comment on Dale’s case specifically.

Immigration attorneys told 9NEWS that while people in removal proceedings are always subject to detention under the law, past administrations rarely detained individuals who were not considered flight risks or threats to the public.

Kelli said her husband has had no arrests or tickets in nearly two decades, has passed repeated background checks for his jobs and volunteer coaching, and has successfully renewed his green card multiple times.

“If this was truly an issue, and they truly thought he was a criminal, then I feel like they should have done something a lot sooner than now,” Kelli said.

The family’s next chance at relief comes Sept. 3, when Dale’s case is scheduled for a hearing.

Until then, Kelli said, “We’ve done everything right, and he’s being punished for something that happened as a kid... They're just kind of picking up anybody and everybody and not taking into consideration the other aspects of their life.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/d8caac2f-3a7b-4255-96d3-5d61ac2a5173/20250826T033258/d8caac2f-3a7b-4255-96d3-5d61ac2a5173_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:14.688132

Brian Kemp is sending approximately 75 members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with immigration enforcement efforts, his office announced Monday. The Peach State is joining 18 other states to mobilize a collective 1,700 troops nationwide.

Guard members will not be tasked with making immigration arrests, but instead will assist with “administrative and logistic support,” according to the governor’s office. Processing and training is scheduled to begin in mid-September.

“I am proud to stand with President Trump’s team in the ongoing efforts to secure our nation’s border and keep Americans safe,” Kemp said in a statement. “With the longest continuous presence at the border of any National Guard, Georgia has led on this front for years and will continue to do so through this latest measure while still meeting all responsibilities and duties the Guard has to the state.”

State officials also stressed that partnerships between the National Guard and other governmental entities are not new. In February of 2024, Kemp authorized members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist with Texas’ border operations.

They also said that the move to have guard members assist with immigration enforcement “is different and separate from” Trump’s recent takeover of the District of Columbia.

State Rep. Eric Bell, a Jonesboro Democrat who served in the U.S. Navy, condemned the use of the Georgia National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement.

“I believe Georgia is standing at a crossroads regarding governance and the protection of individual rights,” he said in a statement. “What is before us is not from foreign shores but from within—the possibility of deploying troops on our own soil, against our own citizens. This is no act of security. I believe this an attempt to create division among Americans and Georgians and could be seen as serving private interests rather than the public.”

Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, also condemned the mobilization of the national guard.

Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.
The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.
“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.
Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.” Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter.","Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) risk exposing the US to another Hurricane Katrina, staff at the agency have warned Congress in a withering critique that also takes aim at its current leadership.

Writing in the run up to this week’s 20th anniversary of the devastating 2005 storm that killed 1,833 people and caused widespread destruction in New Orleans and the Gulf coast, more than 180 current and former Fema employees say the Trump administration’s policies are ignoring the mistakes that led to it.

The letter, sent to members of Congress and a council formed to examine the agency’s future, follows months of criticism of Fema from Trump and senior administration officials, who have threatened to close it, prompting more than 2,000 staff – about one-third of its permanent workforce – to depart, leaving it short of institutional expertise in key positions.

It comes after last month’s deadly flooding in Texas that left at least 135 – including 37 school children – dead. Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.

The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.

“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.

“The inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves.

“Two decades later, Fema is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKERMA was designed to prevent.”

It is also scathing about Kristi Noem, who as homeland security secretary, has overall responsibility for Fema, and about two administrators who have been placed in charge of the agency since Trump’s inauguration.

“Since January 2025, Fema has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a Fema administrator,” the signatories said.

The letter identifies the current Fema acting administrator, David Richardson, who has no previous experience in disaster management, and his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, who was appointed by Trump only to be fired after publicly saying he opposed plans to abolish the agency.

“Decisions made [by Noem, Richardson and Hamiltion] … hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,” it said.

Noem has angered seasoned officials by demanding that contracts worth more more than $100,000 be personally approved by her – a stipulation specialists say significantly slowed the response to the Texas floods.

Richardson’s suitability was questioned after he told staff that he did not know the US had a hurricane season – which lasts from the start of May till 30 November. His office later insisted he was joking.

The letter states: “Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration.”

Six statements of opposition in the letter include condemnation of “the ongoing failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator, as required by law”.

It also includes criticism of the administration’s “censorship of climate science”.

“This administration’s decision to ignore and disregard the facts pertaining to climate science in disasters shows a blatant disregard for the safety and security of our nation’s people and all American communities regardless of their geographic, economic or ethnic diversity,” the signatories write.

A petition at the end of the letter demands that Fema be given full cabinet level agency status and defended from interference from the Department of Homeland Security. The department recently ordered Fema agents to assist Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (Ice) agents in immigration raids, threatening to fire those who refused.

Trump, who has set up a review council headed by Noem to consider Fema’s future, has repeatedly said he favors its abolition, though he softened his rhetoric following the Texas floods, amid suggestions that it could be “rebranded” with more of its functions being devolved to the states.

Thirty-six of the signatories – including some currently working at the agency – attached their names, leaving them open to possible retribution. Another 144 withheld their identities.

One signatory, Michael Coen, a former Fema chief of staff under Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told the Guardian in a statement: “I am proud of the current and former FEMA employees for having the courage to speak up. Lessons were learned from Katrina and Congress took action. Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.”

Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa1168160e80a7a8a3958e24ef340680b45aaee6/478_373_3989_3191/master/3989.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=792b34eda05268785709fae9edf219b2",N,,2025-08-26 06:56:40.544249

This month’s blog focuses on the Government’s White Paper which outlines proposed changes to the UK immigration system. It critiques the dangerous use of demonising and divisive rhetoric surrounding migration, especially in the wake of further far-right violence this summer.

“Restoring Control Over the Immigration System: White Paper”

In the Prime Minister’s foreword to the White Paper[1], he describes the recent rates of migration to the UK as an “explosion” causing “[incalculable] damage”. He states that the previous government operated a “one nation experiment in open borders” and failed “to bring inward migration under control”, which has created a “wound […] when it comes to trust in politics”.

In the wake of further anti-migrant protests by the far right across the UK, this is an unfortunate continuation of the worrying trend of politicians using demonising language surrounding migration. Hundreds of refugee organisations have therefore sent an open letter to leaders of the main political parties in the UK asking that they take action to end this and address the “pernicious and insidious currents of racism and hatred underlying these protests”.[2]

Background

The case for reducing net migration is said in the White Paper to be premised on “unsustainable” increases in the rates of migration and the need for “desirable” forms of migration i.e. migration which the Government believes will increase economic productivity. The Government’s proposals in the White Paper to restrict and reduce lower-skilled migration, and increase productivity in the domestic workforce, include:

ending the Adult Social Care Visa route;

increasing the threshold for skilled worker visas to graduate level (RQF 6) and the salary threshold (to £25,600), in order to significantly reduce the number of occupations that are eligible;

increasing access to visa routes for targeting and recruiting “global talent”; and

introducing a requirement for key sectors to produce a “workforce strategy”, outlining the steps employers will take to increase skills and training, in order to engage the domestic workforce.

Use of technology

A key aspect of the White Paper is regarding the use of new technology to increase public confidence in immigration control and strengthen enforcement activity.

Body-worn video cameras, mobile biometric kits and an “advanced data management system” will be introduced to enable immigration enforcement officers identify overseas nationals and access digital identities/immigration statuses.[3] Border Force will use AI and facial recognition technology in order to gather the most accurate information available on each individual seeking to enter the UK.[4] The White Paper also refers to the introduction of new “Intelligence systems” for the purpose of strengthening immigration enforcement, including:

The database for the new eVisa system (digital-only form of immigration status which has replaced Biometric Residence Permits) records data which will enable enforcement action to be taken as soon as someone overstays their visa and to ensure that benefits, services and employment are not accessible such individuals. The database will alert the Home Office where a visa has expired, digital records can be updated in real time, and information will be shared with other government departments.[5]

The Government also plans to develop a “new digital service” which will be capable of showing whether an individual is inside or outside the UK at any time and whether they have complied with the terms of their visa. This data will also be used “to support further immigration applications in more automated ways”.[6]

The increasing use of digital profiling and surveillance technologies to gather sensitive data about individuals who want to enter, leave or remain in the UK, is concerning and risks being disproportionately intrusive and infringing the rights of individuals including under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. There is no clear legal basis for the increasing use of AI and facial recognition technology for immigration control purposes or for storing sensitive biometric data on national database. The Government has not published any policies to set out how sensitive categories of data will be used or shared with third parties.

There is also a concerning lack of accountability which has already been documented by Privacy International in relation to the Home Office’s use of photographs collected from immigration databases onto a secret facial recognition library which the Metropolitan Police has access to.[7]

Settlement and Citizenship

The White Paper proposes a key change to the Immigration Rules in increasing the qualifying period for leave to remain from 5 to 10 years. It prefaces that “settlement” and “citizenship” should be earned and be available to those making “greater contributions” to the UK economy. It is suggested that reductions to the qualifying time period to settle or to naturalise as British will be possible through the introduction of a points-based system.

It is also proposed that English language requirements for skilled workers and settlement are increased from B1 to B2 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages “CEFR”); and that adult dependents be able to demonstrate a basic level of English (Level A1, CEFR) to be granted entry clearance.

The above changes are said to be justified on the basis that they are necessary for “successful integration”, “community empowerment” and “social cohesion”.[8] However, extending the time periods to settle in the UK risks prolonging the precariousness of immigration status and frustrating integration or belonging, which is at odds with social cohesion, the stated aim of the White Paper. Similarly, through introducing a Points Based System the idea of conditional belonging is emphasised, with migrants being required to demonstrate that their contributions are of value to readily secure permanent immigration status.

Asylum

The White Paper confirms the Government will introduce further substantial reforms to the asylum system and border security to reduce irregular and illegal migration. As we explained in our first blog post[9], in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill 2025, the Government has upheld provisions to criminalise asylum seekers who enter the UK via an irregular route originally introduced in the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

It is important to note that there are very few refugee and sponsorship schemes currently available to asylum seekers, and that some such as the Afghan Relocation Programme have recently been closed.[10] The criminalisation of migrants on the basis of their mode of arrival to the UK ignores this fact. Statistics confirm that 70% of people who arrived by way of small boats between 2018 and 2024 were from Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Syria, and Eritrea – countries from which there are not currently safe or “legal” routes to the UK. Furthermore, 68% of people who arrived by small boat during that same period were granted refugee status[11], showing that the mode of travel is irrelevant to the merits of an asylum seeker’s underlying protection claim.[12]

The White Papers states that new policies will be introduced to ensure that asylum claims by those who enter the UK on other visas can be refused where conditions in the individual’s home country have not “materially changed” since their arrival.[13] The Government has also indicated that it will review existing refugee and sponsorship schemes such as the Ukrainian Scheme, to ensure a clear and sustainable sponsorship framework,[14] and that it will explore a system for allowing UNHCR recognised refugees to apply for employment through existing sponsored work routes.[15]

Concluding points

Following the election, the Prime Minister pledged to uphold the rule of law and the UK’s international human rights obligations. However, the digitalisation of the hostile environment, closing refugee and sponsorship schemes (such as Afghan Resettlement Programme), and proposals to restrict asylum claims as set out in the White Paper, exemplify how the rule of law and international human rights obligations are arguably absent from the Government’s plans to reform the immigration system.

The White Paper encompasses policies that are “as much symbolic as they are substantive. Choosing between them has tangible implications for those directly affected. But those choices also say something – and are intended to say something – about those politicians and parties making that choice”[16]. The White Paper can be read as the Government framing itself as fulfilling a political mandate to reduce migration to the UK and strengthen immigration enforcement. However, now, more than ever, we need a Government that is not afraid to reject divisive and reductive rhetoric and one that will uphold human rights and create protections for the most vulnerable. As the open letter from refugee organisations to party leaders rightly recognises:

“The responsibility to end the divisive politics, racist rhetoric and demonising language of the past is yours. Only then will you bring unity instead of division and cohesion rather than hate.”

Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people.
Reform UK says it would make £2bn available to put towards returns deals if it won power, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on countries that do not co-operate.
Reform UK said it would aim to scale up deportation charter flights to five per day.
The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.","Reform UK has said it would offer payments to countries like Afghanistan to enable ""mass deportations"" of migrants who arrive in the UK on small boats.

The party's leader Nigel Farage set out a five-year plan to detain and deport all migrants who arrive in the UK without permission at a news conference in Oxford.

Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people.

Reform UK says it would make £2bn available to put towards returns deals if it won power, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on countries that do not co-operate.

Launching his plan, Farage described illegal migration as a ""scourge"" on the UK.

""The only way we'll stop the boats is by detaining and deporting absolutely anyone who comes via that route,"" Farage said.

""And if we do that, the boats will stop coming in days because there will be no incentive,"" he added.

Under the plan, people would be arrested on arrival, detained at disused RAF bases and, if agreements were reached, returned to their countries of origin, including Afghanistan and Eritrea, where a significant number of people on small boats come from.

The party says it would build removal centres in remote areas of the country under plans to detain up to 24,000 people within 18 months.

The party would also look to countries such as Rwanda and Albania to house migrants, and seek to use British overseas territories such as Ascension Island as a ""fallback"" if people awaiting deportation could not be sent elsewhere.

Reform UK said it would aim to scale up deportation charter flights to five per day.

Key to the plan is the passage of a new law called the Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill.

Reform UK said the bill would create a legal duty for the home secretary to remove illegal migrants, and ban anyone who had been deported from re-entering the UK for life.

To make removals easier, Reform is promising to leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), repeal the Human Rights Act and ""disapply"" international treaties like the Refugee Convention for five years.

A Reform UK government would give migrants the option to return voluntarily and offer them £2,500 for doing so and pay for the cost of their flight, the party says.

Reform said the plans would cost about £10bn over five years, but would save the government money it spends on asylum hotels and other costs over the long term.

The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.

The arrival of migrants on small boats has contributed to an increase in asylum claims in recent years and put pressure on the UK government to stop the crossings.

Nearly 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel on small boats since the start of the year, and a record 111,000 asylum applications were made in the year to June.

The latest Home Office figures show of those who claimed asylum in the UK in the year to June, about 40% arrived via small boat.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f060/live/7156ea20-8263-11f0-ba76-2552413beb48.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 07:56:35.902022

Some UCLA medical school faculty are members of a broader campus organization, the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group, that has aired complaints publicly for months at UC regents meetings about antisemitism.
In a Monday statement, a spokesperson for the UCLA medical school said it opposed antisemitism.
“Antisemitism has no place at UCLA’s medical school.
Tense disagreements have erupted at the UCLA medical school between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students, faculty and staff since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza.","The UCLA and UC San Francisco medical schools have been given two weeks to submit years of internal documents to a Republican-led congressional committee about alleged antisemitism and how the schools responded, widening the federal government’s far-reaching investigations into the University of California.

The demands from House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) cited reports of Jewish people “experiencing hostility and fear” at each campus and that universities had not proved that they “meaningfully responded.”

Walberg’s letters said the committee would be investigating whether the schools violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.

The additional investigation comes as top UC officials and the Justice Department have begun negotiations over allegations that the UCLA campus overall has been hostile to Jewish students, staff and faculty. The federal government has suspended more than $500 million in health, medical and energy research grants from UCLA and is seeking $1 billion and major campus changes before restoring the funds.

The Trump administration cited alleged Title VI violations when pulling the money.

The House committee said Monday it wanted “all documents and communications” since Sept. 1, 2021, tied to complaints of antisemitic incidents at UCLA and UC San Fransisco. A similar letter was also sent to the University of Illinois College of Medicine.

Some UCLA medical school faculty are members of a broader campus organization, the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group, that has aired complaints publicly for months at UC regents meetings about antisemitism.

The group’s chair, medical school assistant clinical professor of psychiatry Kira Stein, is mentioned in the Monday letter to UCLA as a faculty member who has reported anti-Jewish incidents.

“Federal lawmakers, in their letter released today, echoed what many of us have experienced firsthand: Antisemitism at UCLA is common, corrosive, and continues to be met with silence and inaction from the university administration and local leaders,” Stein said in a statement Monday.

The committee has asked for communications with UCLA’s medical school dean, administrators who work on diversity or restorative justice-related programs, and several other positions as well as data on specific events and courses, including one on “structural racism and health equity.”

It also asked for emails from administrators “referring or relating to antisemitism or the terms Jewish, Israel, Israeli, Palestine, or Palestinian.” And it requests information about a January report focused on the medical school that a UCLA task force on anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism prepared.

That 35-page report said “students, residents and faculty in the David Geffen School of Medicine who express support for Palestinian human rights, and who offer any criticism of Israel’s violation of them, face harassment from within and outside the medical school.”

The House committee has asked for “all documents and communications since October 7, 2023 in the possession of the office of the executive vice chancellor” — UCLA Provost Darnell Hunt — related to that task force. Members of the task force have accused UCLA of not taking complaints of bias incidents against Muslims, Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans as seriously as it has reports of antisemitism.

Walberg said that, in addition to Title VI enforcement, he would use the documents to “aid the committee in considering whether potential legislative changes, including legislation to specifically address antisemitic discrimination, are needed.”

The UCLA medical school is also under a Department of Health and Human Services investigation over accusations that it “discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national origin in its admissions.” UCLA denied the charges and the department has not formally announced the results of its investigation that began in late March. But when it canceled hundreds of millions in grants to UCLA last month, the Trump administration said the action was due in part to its belief that the university illegally uses race in admissions.

In a Monday statement, a spokesperson for the UCLA medical school said it opposed antisemitism.

“Antisemitism has no place at UCLA’s medical school. Protecting the civil rights of our Jewish community members remains a top priority,” the statement said. “We are committed to fair processes in all our educational programs and activities, consistent with federal and state anti-discrimination laws and continue to take specific steps to foster an environment free of antisemitism and other forms of discrimination and harassment.”

A spokesperson for UC San Francisco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tense disagreements have erupted at the UCLA medical school between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students, faculty and staff since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza. Each has accused the other of discrimination, doxxing and harassment. Incidents at the school have been cited by two UCLA task forces, one that looked at antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias and the other that researched anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7354569/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1908x1002+0+95/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2Fdf%2Fdacb35f643de84f27dfe65db68b0%2Fme-david-geffen-school-medicine.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 04:56:16.604387

The letter was published online but was addressed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, which the Trump administration set up to explore ways to reform the agency.
The FEMA staffers, which included 143 current and 38 former employees, had additional concerns that they outlined, including cuts to risk reduction programs, climate science and the agency’s workforce.","A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees warned Monday that the Trump administration is weakening the disaster response agency’s capacity and preventing it from carrying out its mission.

In a letter, the 181 current and former staffers particularly pointed to an administration policy requiring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to conduct a “personal review and approval of all contracts, grants and mission assignments over $100,000.”

They said this “reduces FEMA’s authorities and capabilities to swiftly deliver our mission.”

“Consequences of this manual review became tragically clear during the July 2025 floods in Kerrville, Texas, when mission assignments were delayed up to 72 hours; FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue Branch Chief resigned, citing these delays as cause,” the staffers wrote.

They also lamented there is no congressionally approved administrator helming the agency and said its current leader is not qualified for the position.

The letter comes as the Trump administration has floated the idea of eliminating the agency altogether, and has generally sought to diminish its role while placing more responsibility on states.

The staffers said such policies are making things worse.

“Cuts to these programs prioritize the appearance of cost reduction and empowerment of SLTT [State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial] partners but will result in an opposite outcome,” they wrote.

“When we cannot work directly with our SLTT partners in providing training and technical assistance, we lose critical opportunities to maintain trust, strengthen systems, improve preparedness, and serve the American communities we swore an oath to protect at the moments of their most dire need,” they added.

Acting FEMA Press Secretary Daniel Llargues defended the Trump administration’s moves.

“The Department of Homeland Security, under the leadership of Secretary Kristi Noem, is committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people. For too long, FEMA was bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes that failed to get disaster dollars into survivors’ hands. The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

“It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,” the statement continued, pointing to reforms including “Rapid, upfront funding was provided in New Mexico following recent flooding — a shift away from slow, reimbursable models that left families waiting for years in the past.”

In a letter called the “Katrina Declaration,” named after the 2005 hurricane that killed hundreds of people, the current and former FEMA staffers said the agency is losing progress made in the aftermath of the storm.

“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one: the inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves for days,” they wrote.

The staffers noted that such failures resulted in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), but warned that current policies could take the nation backwards.

“Two decades later, FEMA is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKEMRA was designed to prevent,” they wrote.

The letter was published online but was addressed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, which the Trump administration set up to explore ways to reform the agency. It also was sent to various congressional committees.

The FEMA staffers, which included 143 current and 38 former employees, had additional concerns that they outlined, including cuts to risk reduction programs, climate science and the agency’s workforce.

They called on Congress to make FEMA a “cabinet-level independent agency,” defend the agency from “further interference from DHS, including illegal impoundments of appropriated funding,” and protect employees from “politically motivated firings.”

The administration’s cuts to the disaster agency have come under particular scrutiny in light of the deadly floods in Texas. The administration has, in recent weeks, walked back its calls to ax the agency outright, but has doubled down on its assertions that it hopes to dole out less money through the agency and give states more responsibility.

Staffers at other agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have published similar letters.

Nigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.
The Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights prioritising citizens’ rights.
Writing for the Telegraph, he described international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”.
“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said.","The Home Office has promised a “big surge” in asylum hotel closures in the new year, with five more to shut in the coming months, as ministers face mounting pressure over the government’s record on immigration.

Speaking after a weekend of protests and counter-protests over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the government had inherited a “border security system in tatters” and accused opposition parties of offering “the fag packet plans without the substance on delivery”.

Nigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.

The Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights prioritising citizens’ rights.

Writing for the Telegraph, he described international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”.

“The time has come to put this country first,” Farage said. “This is all a question of priorities. Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and human rights lawyers?”

Farage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority of Labour supporters. The findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis.

Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused the Conservatives of leaving behind a broken system.

“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both, saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against.

“Under the Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the substance on delivery.

“Illegal migration is a complex, global problem requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”

A government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”, describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely.

The number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in 2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.

Home Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in securing alternative housing.

Rising public anger over asylum accommodation has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October 2023.

Findlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an entirely right way to protest.”

The fallout from the Epping asylum hotel ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered the removal of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essex after local Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision has emboldened other councils to consider similar action.

Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors, planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC; the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association.

The Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”.

A two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.

Despite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87cfad8443230183d9bc83422fc0a657c8bbd298/0_0_5002_4000/master/5002.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00efbea264844cff475ca63bcc6a8ddd",N,,2025-08-26 00:56:27.366837

Khaki said the citizenship clinic typically occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall.

To participate in the clinic, people must first attend an information session. This fall, Human Rights Officer Shafina Khaki said the Human Rights Division is keeping immigrant communities informed with safety as a top priority.

Khaki said the citizenship clinic typically occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. She said participants expressed concerns and fear about their safety due to the current political climate.

“Many residents need more details and explanations on how to navigate this political climate and the laws that are coming down in very real time,” Khaki said.

During the citizenship clinic on Sept. 13, attorneys from American Gateways, a nonprofit serving the low-income Central Texas immigrant community, will provide free assistance to the first 55 people to complete the N-400 application for naturalization, according to the clinic’s flyer. This clinic coincides with the citywide Welcoming Week, a series of events that recognize the contributions and presence of the immigrant community.

A common source of confusion is the distinction between lawful status and lawful presence, said Krystal Gómez, managing attorney at the Texas Immigration Law Council.

“There isn’t a code a person can point to and say, ‘Oh, here are all the people who are lawfully present under immigration law,’” Gómez said. “Lawful presence is not something that is defined in immigration law. It’s usually interpreted as somebody who is not accumulating unlawful presence.”

Some non-citizen students experienced confusion when paying for tuition after the Texas Dream Act was overturned on June 4. This law previously allowed them to qualify for in-state tuition if they resided in Texas for at least three years, graduated from or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in Texas and signed an affidavit agreeing to apply for legal status as soon as they were able to. Gómez said there have been different interpretations of the court order.

“What we’re seeing is essentially chaos,” Gómez said. “The court didn’t offer any kind of guidance on how schools should be implementing their court order, and as a result, we’ve had schools take various positions on what the court order means.”

Gómez said students can reach out to the council with questions to see if they have a pathway toward legal presence or if they need guidance from an immigration lawyer.

Khaki said the division partnered with the Texas Immigration Law Council to provide information sessions on recent immigration policy updates. The division also works closely with American Gateways during the citizenship clinic information sessions.

“That is a really critical spot for residents to come and to understand not only what the city of Austin is doing specifically, but who our partners are, who we’re working with, who we’re supporting here in our community,” Khaki said.

Whitney Drake, managing attorney at American Gateways, said applications for services are made via telephone.

“It doesn’t require people to travel to our office,” Drake said. “Requesting services with a nonprofit organization or having a consultation with a private attorney doesn’t put that individual at any increased risk. All of that information is confidential.”

Drake said American Gateways continues to receive requests for information and services, despite concerns from participants about moving forward with different types of applications.

“One trend that we are noticing is there is a lot of apprehension among the community that we work with to apply for benefits like immigration relief or a visa or things of that nature,” Drake said. “There’s a lot of fear right now.”

Khaki has been expanding the “Know Your Rights” program for the city to ensure people feel a “strong sense of safety and understanding.”

“It’s recognizing that there are immigrant communities that are really fearful of the various changes that are happening at the federal and the state level,” Khaki said. “As a human being who comes from this community, who understands those fears, I really recognize that we have to meet the moment and continue to evolve and understand that almost day-to-day, things are changing.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/07-21-25_pro-bono-immigration-help_JulianaBrandao.png,N,,2025-08-26 00:56:32.923402

But Washington is one of few states where DACA recipients will be able to keep their government health insurance — with some caveats.

In Washington, hundreds of DACA recipients, also known as ""Dreamers,"" will still be able to participate in the state’s health exchange. But they'll lose out on about $350 per month of additional federal benefits, according to the state's health benefits exchange. These benefits are federal tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies from the federal government that DACA recipients pay into with jobs they get with work authorization.

DACA first started as a program for children without legal status, so that they were protected from removal proceedings while they attended and completed high school or enrolled in the military when it was briefly allowed. They also received work authorization through the program as they got older. Many of those DACA recipients are now adults with U.S. citizen children of their own.

In 2024, the Biden administration changed the definition of ""lawfully present"" for Affordable Care Act eligibility so that DACA recipients were allowed to participate in state and federal health exchanges. But the Trump administration announced it was reversing that rule change in June.

""We could also see an increase in emergency room visits because of people foregoing preventive treatment,"" she added. ""These circumstances can strain the health care system and lead to challenges in providing timely, high-quality care and access to services.""

Washington DACA recipients who are currently in the state’s health exchange will still be able to keep their health insurance, Alongi said, and they're being notified of what will change for them.

For DACA recipients who need health insurance but can’t afford it, the state has already expanded its own health insurance program to provide Medicaid-like benefits to people without legal status who are considered low income.

That means those DACA recipients could get health insurance through the state. But there's a catch: The program has a waitlist of people wanting to apply.

The soldiers and airmen “will remain under the control and direction of the Governor and Adjutant General of Georgia.”

The deployment is separate from the “D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force” mission.

“The GANG has a long history of partnering with federal, state and local agencies to ensure the safety and security of our communities, our state, and our nation,” Kemp’s office said.

A statement from the Georgia National Guard clarified that it “currently has no units in support of the mission” in Washington, D.C.

Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey responded to the announcement Monday night: “Brian Kemp’s decision to deploy Georgia National Guard soldiers to respond to a manufactured crisis is a reckless abuse of state resources and a transparent ploy to win favor with Donald Trump and his MAGA base. Our state’s National Guard members signed up to respond to natural disasters and defend America in war, not be used by Brian Kemp as props in his political theater. They, and the Georgians they bravely stepped up to serve, deserve far better than this misuse of their sacrifice.”

In addition to receiving cease-and-desist orders from several states (Arizona, Illinois, Montana, and Ohio), and ongoing litigation against New Jersey state gaming regulators in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, KalshiEx LLC (Kalshi) is also now embroiled in litigation with regulators in Maryland and Nevada. Kalshi operates as a designated contract market, which allows adults in all 50 states to make financial trades on a broad range of topics — from sports to the weather.

Nevada

Earlier this year, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, notifying the company that it is unlawful to offer event-based contracts on sporting events and election unless it holds an approved license by the Nevada Gaming Commission. In response, Kalshi filed a federal lawsuit stating that it was not required to comply with state gaming laws because those laws were effectively preempted by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and that it falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A federal judge in the case granted Kalshi a significant win by temporarily enjoining NGCB from putting a halt to Kalshi’s sports-related futures contracts while the case was ongoing. In making this ruling, the court found, among other things, that Kalshi was likely to prevail on the merits when the case goes to trial.

Maryland

Like Nevada, Maryland’s Lottery and Gaming Control Agency issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, alleging that the company was illegally offering sports gambling without a license. As the company did in Nevada, Kalshi sued Maryland’s gaming regulators in federal court and similarly argued that it was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC and that state law was preempted by the CEA.

However, in contrast to the Nevada proceedings, the district court in Maryland denied Kalshi’s request to stop Maryland’s gaming regulators from blocking Kalshi from offering its sports event contracts. The court’s ruling explained that it does not see a clear distinction between Kalshi’s sports event contracts and sports betting. Kalshi immediately filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

Why It Matters

The regulatory scrutiny and litigation facing Kalshi highlight a growing tension not just between courts in different judicial circuits, but between federal and state oversight of financial products. If courts side with state regulators, platforms like Kalshi may face significant operational hurdles and fragmented compliance requirements across different states. Conversely, a ruling favoring federal preemption could pave the way for broader adoption of event-based contracts nationwide. The outcomes of these cases could set important precedents for how similar platforms are regulated in the future, potentially reshaping the boundaries of federal preemption under the CEA and the jurisdiction of the CFTC, and opening new markets to businesses like Kalshi, including in states that have traditionally prohibited or strictly regulated sports wagering.

Kemp also emphasized that assigning the Georgia National Guard to work with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies is nothing new. The governor sent Guard troops to the Texas border with Mexico early last year, accusing the Biden administration of failing to secure the border.

""Under the bad policies of the prior administration, every state became a border state,"" he said.

Rather, they will be providing administrative and logistical support, including appointment scheduling, biometric collection, data entry, and performing basic vehicle maintenance in order to free up ICE personnel for law enforcement activities.

Nonetheless, Democrats criticized the deployment decision as unconstitutional and unsustainable.
