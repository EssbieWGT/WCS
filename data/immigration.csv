“As an American, I’m angered and terrified to watch our constitutional rights be eroded by the Supreme Court.

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a restraining order from a judge that had restricted immigration agents from stopping people around L.A. solely based on their race, language, job or location. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was quick to criticize the decision and argued it could lead to officials targeting “anyone who looks Latino.”

When The View panelist Sara Haines asked Ferrera her reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision, the Barbie actress responded, “First of all, thank God for Justice Sotomayor.”

Ferrera, who is an activist for immigration rights, went on to say she was grateful for “people who still speak with a voice of reason and the values we recognize as American values” amid the decision.

“As an American, I’m angered and terrified to watch our constitutional rights be eroded by the Supreme Court. Everyone should be angered and terrified by it,” she said. “If any American can get pulled over because of the language they speak or the color of their skin or because they work in a low-wage job, who’s safe? So, as an American, I’m pissed off.”

She also spoke about being “a daughter of immigrants who grew up in California.”

She said that the family often had “conversations about immigration,” though they weren’t “close to what we’re living in now.” Ferrera continued, “I remember what it felt like to be a child in elementary school, going to school hearing whisperings and not knowing what that meant.”

“What I know right now is there are children that are terrified. There are children that are terrified, there are families that are terrified of their lives being destroyed in a moment,” Ferrera said. “I think about them, and I think we all have an opportunity to remember who we are and what we believe and what our values are and what we care about and to recognize that there are people suffering and that we all have the capacity to be human and to reach out and to care for each other.”

Ferrera opened up about the topic just two days after Sotomayor appeared on the Tuesday episode of The View. During her appearance, panelist Sunny Hostin asked Sotomayor about her recent dissents, including the one in the court’s immigration stops ruling earlier this week, and what she thought Americans should take away from what she wrote.

“Read the decisions, and not just my dissents, but the other side, too. Become informed citizens and not just reactive, because people will say things that are simply not there, or say things and misconstrue them,” Sotomayor urged the public. “The price we pay is whatever is happening today, as I indicated it’s going to affect a lot of people, but it affects your future and it affects the conduct of leaders in the future, because what we permit today is not going to be duplicated exactly tomorrow, it’s going to be something different.”",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-19088688002.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1,N,,2025-09-12 04:56:43.697841

“There is no rule saying that just because you work with federal government, you’re exempt from all state law,” Mr. Wiener said.
The California State Senate passed the bill on Thursday, two days after the State Assembly approved the legislation.
California lawmakers also passed a companion bill on Thursday that would require local, state and federal agents to wear identifying information such as their name or badge number.
That bill was less controversial, and while some law enforcement agencies opposed it, the legislation received support from the major association representing local police officers in California.","California state lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday that would bar most law enforcement officers from covering their faces while interacting with the public, a direct response to immigration raids by masked agents who have been difficult to identify.

California’s Legislature is believed to be the first to pass such a bill, though similar proposals have been introduced in other states and Congress.

The legislation now goes to Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose support is not certain. The legislation, passed by Democratic lawmakers who control both houses of the State Legislature, would apply to local and federal agencies, and questions have been raised about whether the state has the legal ability to regulate federal agents.

“We’re looking at the constitutionality of it,” Mr. Newsom said in July in an interview with the Tennessee Holler, a liberal news site.

The Democratic governor explained at the time that he understood that officers may need masks to protect their safety in limited circumstances, but that he thought it was “insane” how widespread the practice had become.

Supporters of the bill said on Thursday that the ban was even more urgent in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this week that allowed federal agents to resume immigration stops based on factors including ethnicity and if someone is speaking Spanish.

“We are in a truly disaster of a situation where we have secret police, effectively, on our streets,” said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who wrote the bill.

“It’s tearing apart the fabric of society,” he added. “You have communities in Southern California where people are scared to go out on the street, they’re scared to go to work, they’re scared to bring their kids to school. And now is the time for us to say what the rules are.”

Mr. Wiener’s legislation would bar officers from wearing face coverings that shield their identities, such as the ski masks, balaclavas and neck gaiters that have become common in recent months during President Trump’s immigration crackdown. It does not apply to medical masks, clear plastic face shields, respirators, eye protection or other safety devices.

The bill would take effect in January if signed by Mr. Newsom. The governor has until Oct. 12 to act on the legislation.

Numerous lawmakers described fear and anxiety in California’s many Latino communities. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democratic state senator from the Los Angeles area, said that one of her constituents was so afraid of immigration agents that he ran onto a freeway and died. She said that her own family members have begun carrying their passports at all times.

“That’s a very strange reality,” Ms. Pérez said.

Opponents of the California bill, including numerous law enforcement agencies, argued that officers must have the choice to cover their faces to protect themselves and their families from retaliation. Limiting the ways officers can keep themselves safe will make it harder to recruit people to work in law enforcement, they said.

“Bad guys wear masks because they don’t want to get caught. Good guys wear masks because they don’t want to get killed,” said Kelly Seyarto, a Republican state senator from Riverside County. “It’s that simple.”

He also argued that the state doesn’t have the power to regulate federal agencies, so that part of the bill is likely to be thrown out in court, and that the bill would wind up creating new civil liability for local officers because of how it would be enforced.

Mr. Wiener pointed to an opinion from the legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, who argued that the policy is constitutional because it does not only apply to federal agencies. State and local governments can require that federal agencies comply with general laws, Mr. Chemerinsky wrote, such as speed limits and restrictions on the use of force.

“There is no rule saying that just because you work with federal government, you’re exempt from all state law,” Mr. Wiener said.

The California State Senate passed the bill on Thursday, two days after the State Assembly approved the legislation.

Similar bills have been introduced in other states — including New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Michigan — but have not yet passed.

California lawmakers also passed a companion bill on Thursday that would require local, state and federal agents to wear identifying information such as their name or badge number. That bill was less controversial, and while some law enforcement agencies opposed it, the legislation received support from the major association representing local police officers in California.

While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees.","McCOOK, Neb. — Frustrated by a dearth of information coming her way, a Nebraska lawmaker showed up unannounced this week at the state prison system’s Work Ethic Camp more than four hours from her home district.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha has been an outspoken critic of Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to repurpose the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention center, which he announced Aug. 19. The planned prison conversion in this rural community of about 7,200 residents came at the State of Nebraska’s request in response to the Trump administration’s deportation push.

Upon her arrival Wednesday, Juarez was provided a guided tour, which the Examiner was not allowed to join. Afterward, she said she was impressed with the grounds and the prison property’s current use: preparing low-risk inmates with programming to ease their reentry into society.

However, she shared concerns. Among them: worries about crowded conditions — both for a future migrant population and for the broader state prison system that will likely absorb the 186 Nebraska inmates being relocated to other prison facilities from a rehabilitative setting in southwest Nebraska.

“There is no way that I believe 300 people could be housed in that McCook facility,” she said, noting that an area of the prison currently used for teaching appeared to be one of the likeliest spaces for expanding bed space. “I can just see them squeezing these double bunk beds into these rooms.”

Midwest hub for ICE

Pillen has said up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation are to be housed in the repurposed center, which the state will run in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The governor has said he envisions the facility as a Midwestern hub for ICE.

As of Thursday, the Work Ethic Camp had 155 of its 186 state inmates left to relocate. State senators have said the McCook facility, which opened in 2001, was originally designed for 100.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said the state anticipates that the McCook facility will begin housing its new population of migrant federal detainees in October.

After talking with current Work Ethic Camp inmates about their circumstances, Juarez said she wants the state to consider early release rather than relocation for incarcerated people within a year of completing their criminal sentences.

“To me this circumstance is so unique,” Juarez said. “I’m advocating for as many people to be released as possible. If there are men there that are ready to be let go, I think they should be able to go home.”

Juarez discussed her interaction with one McCook inmate, who told her he had six months until his scheduled release and had earned a spot helping in the prison’s kitchen, where he said he was picking up cooking skills. He told her he was anxious that he could be transferred to a facility with fewer privileges.

Said Juarez: “What kind of setback are these guys going to be enduring when they get moved?”

A prison system spokesperson, in response, said the department does not have the authority to release individuals early. (That’s up to the Parole Board.)

Spokesperson Dayne Urbanovsky said all Correctional Services facilities have a “robust offering” of rehabilitative services.

“As much as possible, NDCS will work to ensure individuals who have started programs at WEC can finish those at other facilities,” she said in a written response.

Furthermore, Correctional Services is partnering with an engineering firm to “safely repurpose (McCook’s) multi-purpose spaces to accommodate additional beds,” Urbanovsky said.

Closed-door briefing

Juarez is not the only state senator to have recently visited the McCook facility. Two members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, State Sens. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, stopped in earlier this month.

A day after their visit, the Judiciary Committee held a closed-door meeting with certain state officials. The briefing about the conversion plan was organized by Pillen’s Office and Bosn.

DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, did not sign a letter from 13 progressive state senators , including Juarez, requesting a public hearing about the McCook project before the Judiciary Committee.

Unanswered questions remain about Nebraska-ICE jail after private legislative briefing

After Bosn said the request for such a meeting was premature, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who also signed the letter, announced that the legislative committee he chairs, the Urban Affairs Committee, would hold a public hearing Friday for people to air opinions. That meeting begins at 9 a.m. in room 1507 of the State Capitol.

The Urban Affairs Committee oversees building codes issues, and McKinney said he is concerned about overcrowding.

In a letter Thursday, Kenny Zoeller, Pillen’s director of policy research, told McKinney that the administration would not participate in Friday’s hearing. He wrote that the Urban Affairs Committee lacks legal jurisdiction and oversight authority on the matter.

Zoeller also challenged McKinney’s assertion about prison crowding, writing that the state law cited by the lawmaker does not apply.

“An emergency declaration is only required when the department’s system-wide inmate population is over 140% of operational capacity,” Zoeller wrote. “The current average daily population for all NDCS facilities is approximately 115% of system-wide operational capacity.”

Zoeller said the Pillen administration believes it has taken the appropriate action in informing Judiciary Committee members of its plan.

Juarez, a Democrat in her first year as a state lawmaker for South Omaha, said she’s felt frustrated and still wants more details about the McCook-ICE project. She said her visit to the facility better prepares her for future conversations.

“The only reason that I found out as much as I did was because I physically went down there,” she said.

Juarez said it was her understanding that state law, in addition to giving Nebraska state senators access to prisons without prior notice, allows lawmakers to take phones inside to take photographs and videos. She said she was asked to leave hers in a locker.

While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees. For example, she said Work Ethic Camp staff pointed out the current library book selection is written in English.

Juarez said she could assist in gathering reading material in different languages. She said she also wants to know if the proposed ICE detention center would continue to offer, as do state prisons, mental and other health care services.

No signed agreement yet

State officials have acknowledged that many details about the facility have yet to be ironed out. As of Thursday, there still was no signed agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services for the detention center federal officials nicknamed “the Cornhusker Clink.”

Among lawmaker questions is whether the executive branch, Pillen’s administration, has authority to let the feds use the state prison facility. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental reformatory and penal institutions.”

Pillen, however, has cited an article in the Nebraska Constitution saying that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.” He also argues state statute gives him authority through its creation of the Department of Correctional Services.

What’s in a name? Fed moniker for Nebraska immigration jail draws ire and defense

From the start, Pillen has said he felt a responsibility to support the president’s immigration agenda and wanted Nebraska to do its “fair share.” He has said that he and other Republican governors have heard President Donald Trump’s call to “step up” — and that he was proud to also empower the state’s Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol to become a part of Trump’s mass deportation mission.

Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature also have expressed support for the governor’s position on immigration.

A University of Nebraska-Lincoln law professor who studies the impact of detention said the project offers “spectacle, not safety or stability.” Danielle Jefferis, in an opinion piece Thursday in the Nebraska Examiner, said the Nebraska prison system has traditionally argued that “rehabilitation matters” but that the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds.

“That choice is not only about corrections policy,” she wrote. “It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.”

Skeptical of future

In an interview with the Examiner Wednesday outside of the Work Ethic Camp, Juarez said she was less anxious about what might be ahead for ICE detainees after she saw the prison’s grounds, including an outdoor recreational courtyard.

“I felt a little more calm than I had anticipated once I was inside,” she said.

But she said she was unclear and remained skeptical about how operations might change under an ICE contract and said her visit would be the first of more. Her underlying feeling, she said, is that migrants working in the U.S. without a criminal or violent past shouldn’t be held behind bars.

After her tour of the work camp, Juarez dropped off some “We are Friends of Immigrants” signs to local residents who had requested them from an Omaha group that has protested the ICE facility. Juarez told McCook residents that she planned to continue to monitor the changes.

“I’ll be coming back,” she said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3755-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 22:56:41.183374

The government singled out an email from Mr. Mandelson to Mr. Epstein in 2008, in which Mr. Mandelson lamented Mr. Epstein’s conviction for soliciting sex from a minor and gave him advice about his legal troubles.
In the book, he called Mr. Epstein his “best pal,” and added a photo of himself clad in a white bathrobe, laughing with Mr. Epstein.
When Mr. Trump announced the outlines of a trade deal with Britain in May, Mr. Mandelson stood behind him in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump spoke by phone to Mr. Starmer.
In the late afternoon, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation lowering the flags to half-staff in Mr. Kirk’s honor through Sunday.","“These conditions have nothing to do with homelessness,” said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, one of the organizations that filed the suit. “It’s carrying out a political agenda in a program that should never be partisan.”

The suit contends that the conditions violate the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to dictate spending, and conflict with grant-making rules. The housing department did not respond to a request for comment.

King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, filed a similar lawsuit this year when the administration attached conditions to homelessness funds that had already been awarded, including compliance with Mr. Trump’s executive orders on abortion and transgender rights. A federal judge in May temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing those demands.

Beyond escalating the administration’s maximalist tactics, the latest rule revision underscores the slow pace of federal aid, despite levels of homelessness often deemed an emergency. Though Congress approved $75 million to build supportive housing in 2023 (and added $100 million the next year), none has been awarded, much less spent.

The administration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ran a competition for the homelessness grants through HUD that concluded in late 2024 but announced no winners before Mr. Biden left office. The Trump administration ran the competition again and notified members of Congress of the winners in August, but it never publicly announced the awards. Last Friday, the administration started a new competition, with applications due in a week because the money expires at the end of the month.

The new, last-minute application reorients the program, called CoC Builds, to help seniors and the disabled and imposes a set of ideological screens, some of which are beyond applicants’ control. It disqualifies groups located in any city, county or state that fails to enforce homeless-encampment bans or cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws.

In addition, it penalizes programs that operate clean needle programs for drug users, that are based in places that do not map sex offenders or that “promote the notion that sex is a mutable or chosen characteristic.”

While it is not clear how HUD will judge compliance, an analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that programs in only nine states, all Republican strongholds, are likely to fully meet the conditions.

The second plaintiff in the suit, the Women’s Development Corporation in Providence, R.I., was among the groups that thought they had won the first competition run by the Trump administration. Last month, the group received a congratulatory call from the office of Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, saying it would receive $7 million from HUD to build 14 new apartments and provide services for the homeless.

Mr. Reed’s office was so confident in HUD’s notification of the funding that it issued a news release. But the official HUD announcement never came, and a new competition was announced.

Frank T. Shea, the group’s executive director, said the new conditions would prevent it from reapplying because Providence lacks an encampment ban and Rhode Island is at odds with the administration on immigration enforcement. In addition, he said, the group would be penalized for having transgender people on its staff.

“None of these factors are relevant to whether this would be a good project, and some we have no control over,” he said.

Internal State Department and U.S.A.I.D. documents and correspondence obtained by The New York Times show that several international organizations, including the Gates Foundation and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, had offered to buy or accept a donation of the contraceptives. The government would have incurred no costs or might have even been able to recoup taxpayer funds under those scenarios.

Instead the administration decided to proceed with destroying the products, an operation that was estimated to cost $167,000.

On Thursday, a spokeswoman for U.S.A.I.D. — which is now being wound down by Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget — said in a statement to The Times that the contraceptives had been destroyed, and falsely suggested that they induced abortion.

“President Trump is committed to protecting the lives of unborn children all around the world,” the statement said. “The administration will no longer supply abortifacient birth control under the guise of foreign aid.”

U.S.A.I.D. is prohibited by law from procuring abortifacients. None of the products held in the warehouse in Belgium were abortifacients, according to inventory lists obtained by The Times. The listed products, such as hormonal implants, stop pregnancy by preventing ovulation or fertilization.

This fact had repeatedly been made clear to State Department officials by veteran global health program staff, the documents show.

It is not clear exactly when or where the destruction took place, and administration officials did not respond to requests for further comment.

“The deliberate destruction of nearly $10 million worth of contraceptives, under the blatantly false pretense that they are abortifacients, is an outrageous act of cruelty,” said Beth Schlachter, director of U.S. external relations for MSI Reproductive Choices, an organization that had repeatedly offered to take over the distribution of the supplies rather than see them destroyed.

“This decision will cost lives, derail progress in global health and strip millions of people of the basic tools they need to plan their families and protect their health,” she said.

In early February, Secretary of State Marco Rubio took over U.S.A.I.D., which was established in the 1960s as a separate agency under Congressional mandate, and began overseeing its closure, a goal sought by several top Trump aides. The few foreign aid contracts that officials kept were moved into the State Department. Employees of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the group formed by Elon Musk, were sent to lead the process.

The destruction of the contraceptives was ordered in June by Jeremy Lewin, the State Department’s senior official in charge of foreign assistance, humanitarian affairs and religious freedom. In an email, he directed department employees to arrange destruction of the contraceptives as “the cheapest option that best reflects the administration’s significant concerns with funding these activities.”

But for a time, it seemed as though the American government was not following through on the plan.

The Belgian government staged a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to prevent the contraceptives from being incinerated at a medical waste facility. The foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, wrote to Mr. Rubio to try to prevent it, according to a Belgian foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic matter.

More recently, authorities in Flanders, the region where the warehouse is, had been trying to invoke a legal ban on incinerating still-usable medical products to prevent the destruction.

Those overtures seemed at least to delay the planned incineration. The stockpile did not appear to have been burned by the end of July, as earlier reports had suggested that it would be.

On July 31, Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman, said at a news conference that the agency was in the process “of determining the way forward.”

As recently as this week, Flemish authorities had not learned of the destruction and remained hopeful that they might reach a solution.

“We did not receive a formal derogation request to allow incineration,” Tom Demeyer, a spokesman for the Flemish environment and agriculture minister, said in an email on Thursday. “We are waiting for the outcome of the legal and technical analysis to see which channels for reuse are viable.”

Belgian authorities had hoped that they might be able to help facilitate a sale of the products, given ample interest from potential buyers. Belgian and Flemish authorities did not immediately comment on the news that the Trump administration had proceeded with the incineration of the birth control supplies.

U.S.A.I.D. employees had informed the administration that seven different organizations were willing to take charge of some or all of the products, and to cover the costs of storing, shipping and distributing them.

A draft memo prepared by veteran U.S.A.I.D. staff members who had worked on family planning programs through multiple administrations recommended that Mr. Lewin sell the products to the United Nations Population Fund because it would recoup at least $7 million and incur no further cost to taxpayers. The other options presented including selling to other organizations or donating the products.

Using the acronym USG for U.S. government, that memo noted that the cost of destruction “is estimated to be a loss of $9.9 M in USG funding,” and said that was “coupled with an estimated $167,000 in destruction costs.”

“Additional funding will likely have to be obligated to cover the destruction costs,” the memo said.

However, political appointees at U.S.A.I.D. instead presented a different memo recommending that the materials be destroyed “due to the absence of eligible buyers” and to avoid contravening an administration directive “halting support to organizations involved in coercive reproductive practices.”

Fourteen minutes after receiving that memo, Mr. Lewin ordered the destruction.

Former U.S.A.I.D. staff members who had moved to a new global health division at the State Department swiftly set about organizing the destruction. Clint Branam, U.S.A.I.D.’s deputy chief of staff for programs, wrote to his colleagues, “I understand this likely wasn’t the outcome you’d hoped for and it’s contentious, but Jeremy said it best reflects the administration’s significant concerns with funding these activities.”

In the list of potential arguments against a sale, officials invoked policies preventing the U.S. government from providing aid to overseas nongovernmental organizations that provide or help with access to abortions, based on a rule that the Trump administration reinstated. U.S.A.I.D. staff members offered solutions to donate the supply that they argued did not conflict with this policy.

At other points, the documents show that government staff members worried that a sale “could appear to be in conflict with administration priorities and attract external scrutiny.” Mr. Rubio transferred the remnants of U.S.A.I.D. from the State Department to Mr. Vought in August so Mr. Vought could oversee the final shutdown of the aid agency.

The State Department referred questions to U.S.A.I.D. on Thursday.

In this case, Republicans resorted to the move in an effort to steer around Democratic obstruction of Mr. Trump’s nominees, which has created a backlog of more than 100, angering the president and frustrating his allies in Congress. They framed it as a necessary step to grease the wheels of a chamber mired in partisan rancor and to return the Senate to its longstanding norm of confirming lower-level nominees without individual votes.

“For two centuries, most presidential nominees have sailed through this chamber by voice vote and by unanimous consent,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican. “That was the gold standard of advice and consent. Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats abandoned it.”

Democrats, vocally opposed to Mr. Trump’s policies and tactics, have demanded that every position be subject to individual consideration, delaying the approval of the president’s nominees and cluttering the Senate schedule. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said the change would do irreparable damage to the Senate and its constitutional prerogatives, rendering it “a conveyor belt for unqualified Trump nominees.”

“We are supposed to debate and take votes on nominees, especially when the executive branch is grossly breaking norms by sending us woefully unqualified, unscrupulous, and in some cases deeply dishonest individuals for powerful and important positions,” he said.

The rule change, which is expected to be finalized next week after a series of procedural votes, will allow the Senate to confirm an unlimited number of lower-level executive branch nominations at a time without the threat of a filibuster. That means Republicans will no longer be forced to negotiate with Democrats to agree on which nominees are deserving of speedy confirmation, as the majority currently must do, but will instead be able to steer around any opposition and push through dozens with a single vote.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, began the process on Monday by introducing 48 of Mr. Trump’s nominees together to allow them to be confirmed as a group.

That bloc covers a variety of positions, such as assistant secretaries in several cabinet departments, the inspector general at the C.I.A. and ambassadors, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former fiancée of Mr. Trump’s eldest son whom the president chose to be the ambassador to Greece.

The breadth of the list illustrates the far-reaching consequences of the rules change. Previously, senators needed 60 votes to bring a bloc of nominations to the floor, all but guaranteeing that both parties would haggle over who might be included.

Now, the party in power will have the ability to unilaterally approve dozens of executive branch nominees with little resistance. And while nominees must still win approval from Senate committees, there will be even less incentive for presidents to choose people who can draw bipartisan support, since members of the minority party will be presented with even fewer opportunities to delay or block anyone’s confirmation.

Republicans, who currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, pushed through the rules change on a 53-to-45 vote, turning to a tactic known as the “nuclear option” to set a new precedent that overrules what has been done in the past.

The dramatic name refers both to the extreme nature of the move and its assurance of mutual destruction: Republicans and Democrats alike must suffer the consequences when they find themselves in the minority.

It was once seen as so devastating to the Senate’s spirit of bipartisan compromise that leaders often threatened it but rarely followed through.

There were signs on Thursday that such concerns remained alive on Capitol Hill. Even after the Senate began voting on Mr. Thune’s initial step to begin the rule change, a bipartisan group of senators continued to haggle over an agreement to avoid the nuclear option, holding open the vote for much of the afternoon while they engaged in frenzied talks.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he believed there was a “considerable, good-faith desire to come to a rules change that is bipartisan and agreeable to most all of us.” He urged senators to cooperate to prove they could turn down the political temperature in the wake of the shooting death of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.

The proposal that senators were discussing would have capped the number of nominations that could be grouped together at 15. But those negotiating the deal would have needed the consent of all 100 senators to move forward, and while Democrats sought to work into the weekend to persuade their colleagues, Republicans were skeptical that a deal could be reached and instead moved ahead unilaterally.

“We were achingly close to a deal,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said on the Senate floor. “But I am afraid that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have run out of patience.”

But Mr. Thune, visibly frustrated, argued that Democrats had had months to come up with a deal to end their roadblock on nominees. “How much time is enough?” he said, addressing Mr. Schatz.

Currently, more than 1,000 executive branch positions require Senate confirmation. Traditionally, many picks below the cabinet level have been confirmed through voice votes or by unanimous consent, essentially an agreement by all senators to bypass debate. But senators in the minority retained the ability to block an individual nominee they found objectionable, slowing the process and allowing more time for the Senate to scrutinize them.

“We are steadily handing away most of the significant constitutional powers of the Senate,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. “That is very dangerous. What happened today with a narrow Republican majority to change the rules of the Senate and make it easier to confirm dozens and dozens of nominations just weakens our Constitution.”

Even with the rules change, some limits will remain. The new Senate precedent will not allow for group confirmations that include judicial appointments or high-profile jobs such as cabinet secretaries.

It does allow for group confirmations of federal prosecutors, at a time when Mr. Trump has pushed to install loyalists and erase the Justice Department’s independence from the White House.

Currently, another longstanding Senate tradition, the “blue slip,” allows home-state senators to essentially veto nominees for U.S. attorney in their home states. But Mr. Trump has demanded that Republicans abandon that custom, raising fears that it, too, could vanish in the face of a highly polarized political atmosphere.

That increased partisanship has seized the Senate, prompting party leaders to make rules changes that were once viewed as beyond the pale.

In 2013, Democrats lowered the filibuster threshold on most nominees to a simple majority, out of mounting frustration that Republicans were blocking Obama administration appointees to an influential court.

Four years later, Republicans retaliated by lowering the threshold for Supreme Court nominees. That move allowed Mr. Trump to put three justices on the bench during his first term.

In its motion, the Justice Department explicitly asked the judges to decide “by the close of business on Monday.” That is the day before the Fed’s voting members — including Ms. Cook — will begin a two-day meeting to determine whether to lower borrowing costs.

In a reply filed hours later, lawyers for Ms. Cook urged the court to reject that request, warning it plunge the Fed’s meeting “into turmoil” while carrying the “real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets.”

Mr. Trump has demanded for months that the Fed lower interest rates, but the central bank has kept them unchanged out of concern that the president’s policies could stoke inflation. At next week’s meeting, the Fed is widely expected to restart interest rate cuts that it paused at the beginning of the year, although officials are unlikely to approve a reduction as deep as Mr. Trump would prefer.

Interest rates at the Fed are set by the seven members of the Board of Governors, on which Ms. Cook serves, as well as a rotating set of five presidents from the regional reserve banks. The government is arguing that Ms. Cook should not be in attendance at that meeting.

The Fed, which is listed as a defendant in Ms. Cook’s lawsuit to block it from carrying out the president’s orders, has said it will abide by any court decision.

Mr. Trump announced he would fire Ms. Cook in late August, claiming that she had engaged in mortgage fraud, even though she has not been charged or convicted of a crime. Still, the president said that the allegations alone met the threshold to dismiss her for “cause” under the Fed’s founding statute.

A District Court judge disagreed, and issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday blocking Mr. Trump from proceeding while the court considers the legality of the matter. In doing so, the judge, Jia Cobb, said that the law did not allow the president to fire Ms. Cook for alleged conduct that took place before the Senate confirmed her to the Fed in 2022.

Mr. Trump has spoken openly about his desire to remake the roster of the central bank with political loyalists who share his views on interest rates. This week, he gained an early victory in the Senate, where Republicans took the first steps toward confirming Stephen Miran, one of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, to fill an opening at the Fed created by the sudden departure of Adriana Kugler.

The expedited timeline could open the door for Mr. Miran to be confirmed in time for next week’s meeting.

“This testimony will help inform congressional efforts to ensure that our banking system has adequate safeguards against illicit activity,” the senators wrote in the letter.

Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is the ranking member on the banking committee.

The request for a hearing comes after an article was published this week by The New York Times Magazine examining JPMorgan’s more than 10-year banking relationship with Mr. Epstein during a period when the disgraced financier was found to have sexually abused teenage girls. The report found that the bank had repeatedly disregarded red flags, including large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions, involving Mr. Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019, and his associates.

The letter to Mr. Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, noted that Deutsche Bank, which became Mr. Epstein’s main lender after JPMorgan severed ties with him in 2013, repeated many of the same errors.

“Testimony from JPMorgan and other institutions that processed Mr. Epstein’s transactions would provide valuable insight on where controls in the system failed,” the senators wrote. “The American people deserve to know what happened at JPMorgan and other banks that financed Mr. Epstein.”

Patricia Wexler, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, said in a statement, “We now know in hindsight that any association with him was a mistake and we regret it.” She added, “We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation.”

Ms. Wexler said the bank fired Mr. Epstein as a client six years before his arrest on federal charges, and suggested the bank could have terminated the relationship earlier if the federal government had gone public with “damning information” obtained in the investigation that led to Mr. Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on state charges.

In recent weeks, a growing number of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties have called for greater transparency with regard to records the federal government has on Mr. Epstein.

On Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, introduced a bill aimed at compelling the Treasury Department to turn over copies of all suspicious activity reports filed by JPMorgan and other banks for thousands of transactions by Mr. Epstein, as well as dozens of his associates or business partners.

Also on Wednesday, Senate Republicans narrowly blocked an attempt by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files compiled by law enforcement agencies.

The revelations about Mr. Mandelson, and the fact that the government was caught off guard by them, are a stinging embarrassment to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was already reeling from the resignation last week of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, after a tax imbroglio.

It casts a shadow over the planned state visit to Britain next week of President Trump, who has praised Mr. Mandelson and met with him at the White House this week. Mr. Trump’s ties to Mr. Epstein have also come under renewed scrutiny after the release of documents by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.

Mr. Trump has denied drawing and signing a lewd greeting to Mr. Epstein for his 50th birthday, brushing aside questions about his association with Mr. Epstein as a Democratic conspiracy. But the British government has taken the disclosures more seriously, making Mr. Mandelson one of the most prominent political casualties of the Epstein affair.

The government singled out an email from Mr. Mandelson to Mr. Epstein in 2008, in which Mr. Mandelson lamented Mr. Epstein’s conviction for soliciting sex from a minor and gave him advice about his legal troubles.

“I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened,” Mr. Mandelson wrote in an email obtained by Bloomberg News. “I can still barely understand it. It just could not happen in Britain.”

Such an expression of solidarity, sent when it was clear that Mr. Epstein was going to serve a prison sentence, made Mr. Mandelson’s position untenable, the Foreign Office made clear in a terse one-paragraph statement.

“Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information,” the statement said. “In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein’s crimes, he has been withdrawn as ambassador with immediate effect.”

Mr. Starmer ordered Mr. Mandelson’s dismissal in a brief meeting with his foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, who took her post only last Friday after a cabinet shake-up. In her previous job as home secretary, she introduced measures to strengthen the response of the police to violence against women and girls.

Mr. Mandelson’s friendship with Mr. Epstein was no secret. Government officials insisted they had vetted him before announcing his appointment last December. But they were clearly blindsided by newly revealed emails, published by Bloomberg on Wednesday night, in which he stood by Mr. Epstein even after his first conviction of state prostitution crimes in Palm Beach, Fla.

Mr. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex charges, in what was later ruled a suicide. Mr. Starmer had come under mounting pressure from opposition leaders and members of his own Labour Party to respond to the questions about Mr. Mandelson and share details of the government’s vetting.

The emails between Mr. Mandelson and Mr. Epstein were not available, either to the British officials vetting him or to Mr. Mandelson himself, because they came from an email account long since closed, a British official said on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.

Mr. Mandelson’s abrupt departure leaves vacant perhaps the most sensitive diplomatic post in the government. Among the names circulating as possible replacements is that of David Miliband, a former Labour foreign secretary.

Mr. Mandelson did not respond to a request for comment on his dismissal on Thursday. But he wrote in a message to The New York Times that Britain and the United States would announce a partnership on advanced technology next week, which he described as his “pride and joy” and his “legacy.”

He has long expressed regret in other interviews for his association with Mr. Epstein and voiced “profound” sympathy for his victims.

Speaking to Harry Cole, a journalist for The Sun tabloid, this week, Mr. Mandelson said it was “very embarrassing” to see his words published in a book of birthday greetings to Mr. Epstein. In the book, he called Mr. Epstein his “best pal,” and added a photo of himself clad in a white bathrobe, laughing with Mr. Epstein.

But Mr. Mandelson, 71, noted that the words were written “over 20 years ago.” He said he never witnessed wrongdoing while he was with Mr. Epstein, whom he visited at Mr. Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.

“I accepted assurances he had given me about his original indictment — the original criminal case in Florida,” Mr. Mandelson said to Mr. Cole. “Like very many people, I took at face value what he said.” He added, “I regret very much that I fell for his lies.”

When Mr. Starmer named Mr. Mandelson as his envoy to Mr. Trump’s Washington, political analysts said it was a bold choice but not without risk. Mr. Mandelson has had a long, checkered career in British politics. He helped craft the New Labour message that propelled Tony Blair into 10 Downing Street in 1997.

But Mr. Mandelson was forced to resign twice from the cabinet, once for failing to disclose a home loan he had taken, and a second time after allegations that he had tried to influence a passport application. (An official inquiry later cleared him of acting improperly over the passport dispute.)

His appointment as ambassador initially drew fierce criticism from allies of Mr. Trump. They pointed to statements he made during the president’s first term when he derided him as a “white nationalist” and a “danger to the world.” Mr. Mandelson apologized for the statements in an interview with Fox News.

He has since revised his characterization, positioning himself as one of the more sympathetic interpreters of Mr. Trump for a skeptical European audience.

“The president may not follow the traditional rulebook or conventional practice,” he said in a lecture last week at the Ditchley Foundation, outside London. “But he is a risk taker in a world where a ‘business as usual’ approach no longer works. Indeed, he seems to have an ironclad stomach for political risk, both at home and abroad.”

Mr. Mandelson made quick inroads after arriving in Washington. He became a fixture in social circles and a regular visitor to the White House. When Mr. Trump announced the outlines of a trade deal with Britain in May, Mr. Mandelson stood behind him in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump spoke by phone to Mr. Starmer.

After Mr. Trump invited him to say a few words, the president told him, “What a beautiful accent.”

Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Charlie Kirk, the conservative influencer and close Trump ally, had been shot while speaking at a Utah college campus. They briefed the president on the initial reports about Mr. Kirk, who had been struck in the neck.

In the hour that followed, the apparently shocked president asked for updates and took calls from a few reporters on his cellphone. Mr. Kirk, the president said, was a terrific man.

He was already speaking of Mr. Kirk in the past tense.

By then, Mr. Trump and White House aides knew that Mr. Kirk had not survived the shooting, according to two people familiar with the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Mr. Kirk’s death would be confirmed publicly a short time later.

Mr. Trump had a close relationship with Mr. Kirk, whose ability to galvanize young conservatives with his criticisms of the left had been crucial to rallying support among a new generation of voters. Mr. Kirk was also close friends with several people in the president’s orbit, including his eldest son, Donald Jr.

But by Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump’s shock had turned to fury. In a video address from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump declared it a “dark moment for America” and faulted the media and the “radical left” for language used to describe people like Mr. Kirk.

“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” said Mr. Trump, who one day earlier had been face-to-face with protesters in Washington who called him Hitler. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”

The fact that Mr. Trump faced two assassination attempts in 2024 — one of them a near miss at a rally in Butler, Pa. — is never far from the minds of his team, and Mr. Trump referenced the Butler shooting in his video. A handmade portrait hanging in the White House shows Mr. Trump being lifted to his feet on the rally stage in Butler, blood streaming from his ear as he pumped his fist.

Earlier at the White House, the corridors of the press offices — an area where reporters are able to move with relative ease — were quiet, as staff there absorbed news about a man many of them were either close with or admired.

Televisions affixed to walls in different rooms blared minute-to-minute coverage of Mr. Kirk’s shooting and then his death, as well as the ongoing search for the killer. Some staff members appeared to have been crying.

In the late afternoon, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation lowering the flags to half-staff in Mr. Kirk’s honor through Sunday. At around 5:30 p.m., a worker in black pants and a black shirt walked to the giant flagpole that Mr. Trump had installed on the North Lawn and cranked the flag down; he repeated the same move with the flag on top of the White House minutes later.

The president was still on track for a visit to New York on the anniversary of the last significant event to unite nearly all Americans across parties: the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Though it failed, Mr. Schumer’s proposal brought the contentious debate over the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, which has roiled the House, to the chamber that has largely avoided it.

Republicans in both bodies have sought to avoid a politically precarious vote on the Epstein files. President Trump has dismissed concerns over the Epstein files as a “Democratic hoax” and urged his right-wing supporters to move on, but his administration’s handling of the issue has inflamed many in the right-wing base.

Though lawmakers hoped the issue would die down over their August recess, it was revived this week when a key House committee released a note and sexually suggestive drawing addressed to Mr. Epstein that contained what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s signature.

Mr. Schumer proposed his Epstein measure as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill and then, using a maneuver available to him as the minority leader, teed up a procedural vote.

“If Republicans vote no, you’ll be saying to the American people that they should not see the Epstein files,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “I ask my Republican colleagues: After all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, why won’t you vote yes?”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, told reporters that Mr. Schumer’s measure was a “stunt” and promised to dispense with it. The Senate voted 51 to 49 to table it.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she opposed Mr. Schumer’s measure because a similar amendment had been adopted on a spending bill that would fund the Justice Department. That bill has not yet been passed by the Senate, but Ms. Collins said it was a more appropriate vehicle for a measure on the Epstein files.

“It does not belong on the Department of Defense policy bill,” she said.

Mr. Schumer was not the first Democrat to try to force the Epstein issue through the Senate. But other efforts, including two from Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona and one from Jeff Merkley of Oregon, used different procedures that allowed them to be defeated without Republicans recording votes.

Mr. Schumer’s proposal was similar to a bipartisan resolution introduced in the House by Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ro Khanna of California. The pair appear within weeks of being able to force a vote on their measure on the House floor, a move that would require the signatures of 218 House members on what is known as a discharge petition.

Their effort got a boost on Wednesday night, when Representative James Walkinshaw, Democrat of Virginia, was sworn in after winning a special election. Mr. Walkinshaw has vowed to sign the petition, which would bring the number of signatories to 217.

“Given the large amount of sensitive data under S.S.A.’s control, I consider the protection and security” of the information “to be a matter of first importance,” Mr. Crapo wrote.

The letter signaled that Republicans were examining the allegations made by Mr. Borges. He sat down last week with Republican and Democratic staff members of the Finance Committee, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session.

In his whistle-blower complaint, Mr. Borges said that members of the Department of Government Efficiency had uploaded a copy of a crucial Social Security database to a vulnerable cloud server. The database contained records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government, in addition to names, addresses and other details that could be used to steal identities.

Mr. Borges said that DOGE had bypassed the “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data, putting it at risk of being leaked or hacked.

Mr. Crapo’s letter was addressed to Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration. It asked him for information about how the agency had responded to Mr. Borges’s concerns, and whether it had followed normal risk-assessment protocols in allowing DOGE to copy the data to the server. The agency was asked to respond by Sept. 23.

Andrea Meza, an attorney at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower group representing Mr. Borges, said in a statement that she welcomed Mr. Crapo’s letter as an “initial step.”

But she said it did not go far enough in seeking answers about the specifics of Mr. Borges’s complaint. She pointed out that Mr. Crapo was not seeking documents from the agency.

“Later this week, we will provide Congress with a recommended list of records to request that would offer far more insight than any self-assessment by the agency accused of wrongdoing,” Ms. Meza said. “If everything was proper, those documents reviewed by an independent investigator will show it.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint, which was first reported by The New York Times, did not indicate that the server set up by DOGE had been breached. A Social Security Administration spokesman said that the agency was not “aware of any compromise” to the database and that it was “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

Mr. Borges resigned three days after submitting his complaint, saying the agency had made it “impossible” for him to perform his duties “legally and ethically.”

Democrats on the Finance Committee this week called for Mr. Crapo to hold a hearing about Mr. Borges’s allegations and the broader state of Social Security. The agency was thrown into turmoil by Elon Musk, then the leader of DOGE, and his team of young software engineers, who advanced false claims of widespread fraud as they sought extraordinary power over closely guarded data.

Taylor Harvey, a spokesman for the Democratic members of the committee, said Mr. Crapo had not yet responded to their request for a hearing.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump’s aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services – a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.
“It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,” she said.","The dreams of immigrants are “just collapsing,” Bishop Evelio Menjivar said before joining a panel of Catholic activists critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

Menjivar, a Washington auxiliary bishop who himself is an immigrant, said immigrants’ imploding dreams are because of instability caused by President Donald Trump's pervasive threat of deportation.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.

Speaking to journalists at Georgetown University on Sept. 11, Menjivar said most immigrants to the United States left their home countries because of political or economic instability — just as he did. Menjivar came to the United States as a young adult to escape civil war in El Salvador.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump’s aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services – a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.

The Washington bishop said he sees fear in the eyes of fellow immigrants and that it plays out in ways such as children not being sent to school, or not allowed to participate in after-school activities. They are opting out of school and activities because their parents “don’t want to risk” their possible exposure to immigration enforcement, Menjivar said.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski has spent time ministering at Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily assembled detention center in Florida that housed immigrants in conditions decried as unsafe and unsanitary as well as for environmental concerns.

In August, a federal District Court judge ordered the administration to wind down operations there by the end of October. On September 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold, pending the administration’s appeal.

Wenski said the Trump administration’s approach is “to paint all immigrants as lawbreakers. But the reality is the law is breaking them. The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.”

Many have started businesses and become established. Now they are being told to go “home,” Wenski said.

Wenski and Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, who chairs the Migration Committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also spoke to reporters about the challenge of trying to explain Catholic teaching about immigration and human rights in ways that are heard by the people in the pews.

Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said

it is “important to know the prevalence of misinformation about Catholic teachings. There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests.”

Seitz said one way to persuade the Trump administration on inconsistencies on immigration might be through the topic of religious liberty.

“It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,” the El Paso bishop said. “We’re happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.”

Ashley Feasley, who is in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, pointed to what has been known as the “sensitive locations” policy started during the Obama administration and kept during the first Trump administration.

“It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,” she said. “Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.”

Feasley said, “many bishops have spoken nationally about their concern about the ability for immigrants and refugees to receive the sacraments, to come to church.

Feasley noted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have pursued migrants into church grounds. Bishops have reported that immigrants are afraid to go to church.

“This is an area where, if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about what is this policy, what can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and peoples’ ability to go about their daily lives and attend to the sacraments,” Feasley said.

“Particularly in this time,” she said, “our ability to be with our church and our faith is just so crucial. I think there are decision makers who would understand this.”",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/IMG_0378.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=a4m3TcDh,N,,2025-09-11 21:56:57.200772

The final vote was 226-197. The 11 Democrats who joined all GOP members present in backing the bill were Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Don Davis (NC), Laura Gillen (NY), Jared Golden (Maine), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Adam Gray (Calif.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (Mich.), Frank Mrvan (Ind.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Tom Suozzi (NY), and Gabe Vasquez (NM).

Introduced by Congresswoman Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), HR 3486 would increase sentences for undocumented immigrants who repeatedly enter the United States illegally or enter the country and then commit a felony. The bill still needs Senate approval to reach the desk of Republican President Donald Trump, who supports it.

After Thursday's vote, Mike Zamore, the ACLU's national director of policy and government affairs, warned that ""HR 3486 would supercharge President Trump's reckless deportation drive, which is already damaging our economy and destabilizing communities.""

""This legislation would hand the Trump administration more tools to criminalize immigrants and terrorize communities at the same time they are deploying federal agents and the military to our streets. It would also undermine public safety by diverting more resources away from youth services and prevention programs that actually improve community safety,"" Zamore said. ""While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation.""

""At a time when president is threatening American cities and the Supreme Court is greenlighting racial profiling, it is vital that a growing number of elected officials are standing together in rejecting Stephen Miller's dystopian agenda to criminalize and demonize people who come to this country seeking a better life,"" he added, calling out the White House deputy chief of staff for policy infamous for various anti-migrant initiatives from Trump's first term, including forcible separation of families.

Speaking on the House floor, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), an immigrant herself, called the bill ""Republicans' latest attempt to scapegoat and fearmonger about immigrants.""

US Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) also spoke out against the bill, saying on social media: ""It does nothing to protect communities or make us safer. Instead, it piles on cruel mandatory minimums, explodes prison costs, and treats families seeking safety like violent criminals. We need real immigration reform, not another zero-tolerance failure.""

Congressman Dave Min (D-Calif.), the son of immigrants, said in a statement that ""in talking with local and state law enforcement officers, I learned that this bill will potentially make it harder for them to do their jobs. By increasing the scope of crimes that local police officers might be expected to enforce, while not providing any funding for this, HR 3486 would effectively reduce the resources our local law enforcement has to keep our communities safe and potentially lead to increases in violent crime.""

Min also pointed to the US Supreme Court's Monday ruling that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to engage in what critics have called ""blatant racial profiling.""

""This bill, combined with the Supreme Court's clearly wrong decision allowing ICE to detain people based on ethnicity, race, language, or place of employment, will give sweeping new authorities to ICE to perpetuate the mass incarceration of immigrants,"" he said. ""I am deeply concerned that HR 3486 will lead to more violent attacks and unlawful arrests by ICE of the people I represent. For these reasons, I voted no earlier today.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56533448&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C456%2C0%2C456,N,,2025-09-11 21:56:52.731885

Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented.
She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time.
Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have likely increased it.
While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., has been reported.","From her home-based day care in Washington D.C., Alma peers out the door and down the sidewalks. If they’re clear and there are no ICE agents out, she’ll give her coworker, an undocumented Latina who lives nearby, a call letting her know it’s safe to head in for work.

They have to be careful with the kids, too. Typically, she took the five children she cares for to the library on Wednesdays and out to parks throughout the week, but Alma — who is also undocumented — had to stop doing that in August, when President Donald Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district. Now, two of the kids she cares for are being pulled out of the day care. The parents said it was because they weren’t going outside.

Trump has deployed the National Guard and a wave of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into the district. ICE arrests there have increased tenfold. The situation has thrust the Latinas who hold up the nation’s child care sector into a perpetual state of panic. Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented. Nearly all are women.

Many are missing work, and others are risking it because they simply can’t afford to lose pay, providers told The 19th. All are afraid they’ll be next.

“What kind of life is this?” said Alma, whose name The 19th has changed to protect her identity. “We are not delinquents, we are not bad people, we are here to work to support our family.”

Alma has been running a home-based day care for the past decade. She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time. With two kids being pulled, she will have to reduce her staffer’s hours as she tries to find children to fill those spots.

Her four school-age children also depend on her. This month, she had to write out a signed document detailing what should happen to her kids if she were to be detained. Her wish is that they be brought to detention with her.

“I can’t imagine my kids here without me,” she said.

She said she understands the president’s approach of expelling immigrants with criminal convictions from the country, but teachers who are working with kids? Who haven’t committed any crime?

By targeting them, she said, the administration is “destroying entire families.”

The Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association in D.C., which works with Latina child care providers, has seen this panic first hand for the past couple of weeks as more and more Latinas in child care have stopped coming into work. The center also helps workers obtain their associate’s degree in early childhood education, and since the semester started in mid-August, many teachers have asked for classes to be offered virtually so they don’t have to show up to campus at night.

Latinas have flocked to the child care industry for multiple reasons: Families seeking care value access to language education, and Latinas have a lower language barrier to entry, said Blanca Huezo, the program coordinator at the Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association.

“In general, this industry offers them an opportunity for a fresh start professionally in their own language and without leaving behind their culture,” Huezo said.

Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have likely increased it. This year, the administration has narrowed opportunities for claiming asylum at the border, tried to bar certain groups from obtaining Temporary Protected Status and temporarily paused humanitarian protections for groups of migrants, thrusting more workers into the “undocumented” category.

The changes, coupled with increased enforcement, has fostered fear among Latinx people regardless of immigration status. That fear among workers is deepening a staffing crisis in an industry that already couldn’t afford additional losses, Huezo said.

“There is a shortage — and now even more,” she said. “There are many centers where nearly 99 percent of teachers are of Hispanic origin.”

Washington, D.C., has been a sanctuary city since 2020, where law enforcement cooperation with immigration officials was broadly prohibited. Earlier this year, however, Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed repealing that law and, in mid-August, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department Police Chief Pamela Smith gave officers leeway to share information with ICE about individuals they arrested or stopped.

“There was some peace that living in D.C. brought more security,” Huezo said. Now, “people don’t feel that freedom to walk through the streets.”

Child care centers are also no longer off limits for ICE raids. The centers were previously protected under a “sensitive locations” directive that advised ICE to not conduct enforcement in places like schools and day cares. But Trump removed that protection on his first day in office. While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., has been reported.

A similar story of fear and surveillance has already played out in Los Angeles, where ICE conducted widespread raids earlier in the summer. Huezo said her organization has been in touch with child care providers in L.A. to learn about how they managed those months.

In the meantime, the best the organization can do, she said, is connect workers with as many resources as possible, including legal clinics, but the ones that help immigrants are at their maximum caseload. The group has put child care workers who are not leaving their homes in touch with an organization called Food Justice DMV that is delivering meals to their doorsteps. Prior to last month, people who needed food could fill out a form and get it that same week. Now, the wait time is two to three weeks, Huezo said. For those in Maryland and Virginia, it’s closer to a month.

Thalia, a teacher at a day care, said her coworkers have stopped coming to work. It’s all the staff talks about during their lunchtime conversations. When she rides the Metro into work, she looks over her shoulder for the ICE agents, their faces covered, who are often at the exits.

“They are hunting us,” she said.

Thalia, whose name has been changed because she is undocumented, has been living in the United States for nine years and working in child care that entire time. Like her, many of the Latina teachers she works with have earned certifications and degrees in early childhood education.

“We are working, we are cooperating, paying taxes,” she said. “We are there all day so other families can benefit from the child care.”

As a single mother, Thalia has also had to consider what would happen to her three children if she was detained. This past month, she retained a lawyer who could help them with their case in case anything were to happen. Her school-age kids know: Call the lawyer if mom is detained and get tickets to Guatemala to meet her there.

This is what she lives with every day now: “The fear of leaving your family and letting them know, ‘If I don’t return, it’s not because I am abandoning you.’”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dc-childcare_2.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 21:57:07.996270

“This is going to give us minimum two to three months delay, because now all these people want to get back [to South Korea],” Muñoz said in Detroit, as reported by Bloomberg.
More than 300 South Korean workers were released from U.S. custody and are expected to arrive back in their home country on Friday, according to the nation’s foreign ministry.
“For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people,” Muñoz said, per CNBC.

“This is going to give us minimum two to three months delay, because now all these people want to get back [to South Korea],” Muñoz said in Detroit, as reported by Bloomberg. “Then you need to see how can you fill those positions, and for the most part, those people are not in the U.S.”

When completed, the factory, jointly operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is expected to hire thousands of American workers. It was originally slated to come online later this year.

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) carried out its largest single-site enforcement operation ever on Sept. 4, detaining nearly 500 people — mostly Korean nationals working on the technical components of building out the factory.

More than 300 South Korean workers were released from U.S. custody and are expected to arrive back in their home country on Friday, according to the nation’s foreign ministry.

“For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people,” Muñoz said, per CNBC. “There are a lot of skills and equipment that you cannot find in the United States.”

That has thrown company officials into a rush to fill in the gaps, the automaker executive said.

During a speech Sunday marking his first 100 days in office, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called on the Trump administration to adjust visa rules for some skilled positions or risk losing future investments in the U.S.

“It’s not like these are long-term workers,” the South Korean leader said. “When you build a factory or install equipment at a factory, you need technicians, but the United States doesn’t have that workforce and yet they won’t issue visas to let our people stay and do the work.”

Hyundai Motor Group Chair Euisun Chung also called for visa reform at the Detroit event Thursday, per Bloomberg’s report.

“I’m really worried about that incident and we’re really glad they’re returning home safely,” he said. “Our government and the U.S. government are working closely, and the visa regulation is very complicated.

(CN) — Three women held in immigration detention smiled, quietly broke into tears and hugged their lawyers in a federal courtroom Thursday after a judge ordered their release on bond.

“It’s so exciting to be able to reunite the individuals with their families,” said Grant Friedman, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska, which represented one of the women. “This order shows the commitment to due process that needs to be respected.”

The women — Nicandra Ozuna Carlon, Yurenia Genchi Palma and Felipa Lorenzo Perez — were among those arrested in the June 10 immigration raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha and had been detained despite immigration judges ruling that they could be freed.

Federal authorities had continued their detention, though, citing what plaintiffs describe as a novel interpretation of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy on bond eligibility. Federal authorities now argue that only those already admitted to the U.S. can be released during removal proceedings, while everyone else must be detained under U.S. code.

Plaintiffs in these cases often describe this as a policy reversal. Previously, most individuals subject to removal proceedings who are found not to be a risk to the community could be released.

In Thursday’s cases, the women sued, and Senior U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Bataillon ordered their release during a hearing at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Courthouse in downtown Omaha.

It was not exactly a surprise. Bataillon has issued the same order for at least three other plaintiffs in similar cases related to the raid.

Still, there had been a new development: a decision on Friday by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the senior U.S. immigration law administrative body, which found that those already in the United States who have entered without authorization are subject to mandatory detention and that immigration judges have no authority to change their custody status.

But following arguments by attorneys, Bataillon agreed with the plaintiffs that he should release their clients anyway since they were being held under the same circumstances as earlier plaintiffs and that the board’s opinion was flawed.

“I disagree with their analysis, and my holding is the same as it was,” Bataillon said.

Eric W. Synowicki, an assistant United States attorney arguing for defendants, had told Bataillon there is a consensus among immigration judges in Nebraska that they can no longer issue bond and that the Board’s ruling applied in the three cases.

“Immigration judges lack authority to grant bond,” he said. “It applies. It is lawful.”

ICE has said many of those arrested engaged in identity theft to get their jobs. Plaintiffs in these cases often point to their own lack of a criminal record in making their claims.

The raid on Glenn Valley Foods rocked Omaha, a city partially built on the backs of immigrant meatpackers since the late 19th century. It came at the heels of video circulating around the city of ICE agents arresting a man in the dining room of a local restaurant in front of patrons during Sunday brunch.

The scene of the Glenn Valley raid was tense, with some throwing rocks at a line of SUVs carrying federal agents, shattering a window, according to some reports.

Immigration has continued to be a contentious issue in Nebraska.

Jorge Cruz came to the US from Mexico City at the age of five after the death of his grandmother and caretaker, and began street vending when he was 11. Over the past two decades, he has grown his solo business into a thriving enterprise, Del Mar Fruits and More, with 25 food carts and 10 employees who sell frutas, elotes, hot dogs, and aguas frescas throughout Santa Monica.

In 2023, Cruz participated in Ruben Ochoa’s installation at Frieze LA, selling fruit to peckish fairgoers. It was the first of several collaborations between Cruz and Ochoa at cultural events, including KCRW’s concert series at the Hammer Museum and the Inner-City Arts Gala, both in 2023, and the 2024 Snapchat Summit. Ochoa views these culinary activations as a form of support and advocacy for street vendors and a way to showcase the critical yet undervalued role they play in LA’s cultural and financial economy.

“As a child of tortilla vendors myself, I can attest to the strong work ethics of many in the vending community who have contributed vital and oftentimes underappreciated roles as providers of affordable quality foods,” Ochoa wrote in a letter of support for Cruz reviewed by Hyperallergic.

“Even though street vendors are statistically more likely to be targeted, harassed, or physically harmed compared to a brick-and-mortar store, Jorge Cruz and many business owners like him continue to work long hours to support themselves and their families,” Ochoa continued. “ I support Jorge Cruz as a person and a small business owner, and in doing so, I support my city.”

Erika Hirugami had invited Cruz to work at the upcoming reception for Concrete Hope, a photography exhibition she curated exploring diverse Latine and Indigenous identities, on October 14. In a call with Hyperallergic, she described Cruz as “essential to the arts community.”

Then, on the morning of August 27, as Cruz and his wife Carmen were returning home from dropping their four kids off at school, they were confronted by approximately six ICE agents.

“We were in our truck. One of their cars got in front of us, the other car got in back. ‘We have an order of arrest for Jorge Cruz,’ they said,” Carmen told Hyperallergic, recounting the incident. “[Jorge] was calm. They arrested him, put him in the car, and took him.”

Cruz called his wife a couple of hours later to tell her that he was in a detention center in downtown LA. The next day, he was moved to a detention center in Adelanto, about 90 miles (~144.8 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, where he is still being held. ICE has not yet responded to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment.

Carmen said she believes the reason for her husband’s abduction stemmed from a verbal altercation he had with another vendor several months ago. Police arrested both men, but the charges were dismissed.

“He went to court, and they gave him a paper saying the case was never filed,” she said. “He had no criminal charges, he was happy.”

Even so, this incident put a target on Cruz’s back, according to Mackenzie W. Mackins, an immigration attorney representing Cruz.

“They don’t care if it’s dismissed. Any contact with law enforcement puts you at the top of the list,” Mackins told Hyperallergic.

Cruz was undocumented when he arrived in the United States as a child, but was protected from deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). He married Carmen, a US citizen, in 2014, and received his green card, which made him eligible to file for citizenship after three years. Mackins has been working with Cruz for years to help him become naturalized, but old arrests, mostly minor infractions related to unpermitted street vending, have made that difficult.

“We’ve been fighting this battle for a long time,” she said, explaining that immigration authorities were already trying to pursue removal because of his past record. “Our argument is, ‘He’s here. He has children, a wife. What’s the point of dragging this on?’”

Cruz is scheduled to have a bond hearing tomorrow morning, September 12. Mackins suggested that statements of support could help the case, and Hirugami started a letter-writing campaign in hopes of sending 200 letters to his lawyer to present in court. Those interested in attending Friday’s hearing at 8:30am PST can do so virtually.

However, due to recent changes to immigration law, anyone who entered the country illegally can be denied bond, according to Mackins. “He’s in a different category because he’s a lawful permanent resident,” she argued. “They should let him go back to his previous status, fighting his removal.”

Cruz’s story may be distressing and maddening, but it is sadly by no means unique. Since Trump took office this year, ICE arrests have reportedly doubled, and the number of people in detention has reached record highs.

“We see it firsthand — people trying to do the right thing to become part of the formal economy through pathways that advocacy groups have made possible,” Patrick Lennon of Revolution Carts told Hyperallergic. The company, which has partnered with Ochoa for several projects, manufactured the first-ever hot food push cart for vendors approved by the LA County Health Department in 2021, and counts Cruz among their first customers.

“[We] see someone like Jorge going through the citizenship process, paying taxes, when all of a sudden they’re picked up and detained,” Lennon said.",https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/jorge-cruz.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 18:56:52.918453

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled once again on Thursday that the automatic stay provision is unconstitutional.
But in his order releasing the three women on Thursday, he did not address whether or not it was lawful and instead focused only on the automatic stay.
Grant Friedman, an attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska who represented Genchi Palma, said he anticipates that detainees in Nebraska and elsewhere will challenge the Board’s decision in federal court.
“I anticipate the landscape will be slightly different, because they wouldn’t be detained under an automatic stay,” Friedman said after Thursday’s hearing.","At a federal courthouse in Omaha on Thursday, three women tearfully embraced their attorneys and each other after they were ordered to be released from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement custody.

Like the six others who had previously been released in nearly identical cases, the three women were detained during the June ICE raid on Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods meatpacking plant. They were granted bond by an immigration judge but were kept in ICE custody after the agency filed its intent to appeal the bond determination. That resulted in an “automatic stay,” which kept them behind bars as the appeal was decided.

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled once again on Thursday that the automatic stay provision is unconstitutional. Yurenia Genchi Palma, Nicandra Ozuna Carlon and Felipa Lorenzo Perez will be released from custody within the next 24 hours.

Their release comes after last week’s decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals that found the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are subject to mandatory detention without a bond hearing regardless of how long they lived in the U.S. or their community ties. Advocates and attorneys say that interpretation goes against decades of precedent.

Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security had argued in both immigration court and federal court that any undocumented immigrant encountered within the U.S. may be treated as an “arriving alien” under Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and thus subject to mandatory detention.

For decades, Section 235 was understood to apply to people encountered while crossing the border or shortly thereafter, while Section 236 was understood to apply to undocumented immigrants who are encountered in the U.S. after residing in the country. People detained under Section 236, like those arrested during the Glenn Valley raid, were entitled to a bond determination hearing.

On July 8, interim guidance issued by ICE said the agency had “revised its legal position on detention and release authorities” and categorized every undocumented immigrant under Section 235.

That legal position was frequently rejected by immigration judges in Nebraska and elsewhere. Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is the highest administrative body for interpreting immigration laws.

While the Board’s decision is binding on immigration courts – meaning that most undocumented immigrants will not be eligible for bond hearings regardless of how long they’ve lived in the country – federal courts are not bound by the decision.

Bataillon said from the bench that he disagreed with the board’s analysis and decision. But in his order releasing the three women on Thursday, he did not address whether or not it was lawful and instead focused only on the automatic stay.

“The Court need not determine the validity of the government’s argument that petitioner should be mandatorily detained under [Section 235] nor the applicability of the BIA’s decision,” Bataillon wrote. “For the time being, the court is concerned only with the lawfulness of the automatic stay.”

That’s likely to change as more people sue after they are denied the opportunity for a bond hearing because of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision. Grant Friedman, an attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska who represented Genchi Palma, said he anticipates that detainees in Nebraska and elsewhere will challenge the Board’s decision in federal court.

“I anticipate the landscape will be slightly different, because they wouldn’t be detained under an automatic stay,” Friedman said after Thursday’s hearing. “We will continue to see lawsuits across the country on this issue as more and more immigration judges start denying bond.”

The lawsuit was originally filed in April on behalf of parties including Latinx farmworker labor union Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. It is among a string of legal challenges seeking to undo the U.S. Department of Homeland Security policy change. The original lawsuit, as well as the document filed this week, claim that “attendance rates dropped in half and school administrators saw an influx of parents picking their children up from school in the middle of the day after hearing reports that immigration officials were in the area.”

K-12 leaders and lawsuits are increasingly reporting a significant and sometimes direct impact on students and parents as a result of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

In Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, ICE activity has included failed attempts to enter two elementary schools after officers allegedly lied about having parents’ permission to speak to students. In that incident, administrators denied the officers’ requests.

More recently, a high school student with disabilities was handcuffed and held at gunpoint “in an alleged case of mistaken identity” just prior to the start of the school year, according to LAUSD officials.

Many of the recorded incidents have taken place during student pickup or drop-off hours on or near school grounds.

Such incidents have created trauma and school avoidance, educators and immigration rights advocates said during a virtual press event last week.

But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.
U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who's no longer welcome in the country.
She would be completely lost there,"" an attorney wrote in a 1999 letter to immigration officials.
Starting from scratch back in Brazil Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women's shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.","It sounded like freedom, like a world of possibility beyond the orphanage walls.

Maria Pires was getting adopted. At 11 years old, she saw herself escaping the chaos and violence of the Sao Paulo orphanage, where she'd been sexually assaulted by a staff member. She saw herself leaving Brazil for America, trading abandonment for belonging.

A single man in his 40s, Floyd Sykes III, came to Sao Paulo to meet her. He signed some paperwork and brought Maria home.

She arrived in the suburbs of Baltimore in the summer of 1989, a little girl with a tousle of dark hair, a nervous smile and barely a dozen words of English. The sprawling subdivision looked idyllic, with rows of modest brick townhouses and a yard where she could play soccer.

She was, she believed, officially an American.

But what happened in that house would come to haunt her, marking the start of a long descent into violence, crime and mental illness.

""My father — my adopted father — he was supposed to save me,"" Pires said. Instead, he tortured and sexually abused her.

After nearly three years of abuse, Sykes was arrested. The state placed Pires in foster care.

By then, she was consumed with fury. In the worst years, she beat a teenager at a roller rink, leaving him in a coma. She attacked a prison guard and stabbed her cellmate with a sharpened toothbrush.

In prison, she discovered that no one had ever bothered to complete her immigration paperwork. Not Sykes. Not Maryland social service agencies.

That oversight would leave her without a country. She wasn't American, it turned out, and she'd lost her Brazilian citizenship when she was adopted by Sykes, who died several years ago. But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.

After her release from prison in 2017, Pires stayed out of trouble and sought help to control her anger. She checked in once a year with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and paid for an annual work permit.

But in the second Trump administration — with its promise of mass deportations, a slew of executive orders and a crackdown targeting those the president deemed ""the worst of the worst"" — everything changed. Trump's unyielding approach to immigration enforcement has swept up tens of thousands of immigrants, including many like Pires who came to the U.S. as children and know little, if any, life outside America. They have been apprehended during ICE raids, on college campuses, or elsewhere in their communities, and their detentions often draw the loudest backlash.

In Pires' case, she was detained during a routine check-in, sent to one immigration jail after another, and ultimately deported to a land she barely remembers. The Associated Press conducted hours of interviews with Pires and people who know her and reviewed Maryland court records, internal ICE communications, and adoption and immigration paperwork to tell her story.

U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who's no longer welcome in the country. Her case, they say, is cut and dried.

Pires, now 47, doesn't deny her criminal past.

But little about her story is straightforward.

A new chapter of childhood, marked by abuse

Pires has no clear memories from before she entered the orphanage. All she knows is that her mother spent time in a mental institution.

The organization that facilitated her adoption was later investigated by Brazilian authorities over allegations it charged exorbitant fees and used videos to market available children, according to a Sao Paulo newspaper. Organization leaders denied wrongdoing.

Pires remembers a crew filming a TV commercial. She believes that's how Sykes found her.

In his custody, the abuse escalated over time. When Sykes went to work, he sometimes left her locked in a room, chained to a radiator with only a bucket as a toilet. He gave her beer and overpowered her when she fought back. She started cutting herself.

Sykes ordered her to keep quiet, but she spoke almost no English then anyway. On one occasion, he forced a battery into her ear as punishment, causing permanent hearing loss.

In September 1992, someone alerted authorities. Sykes was arrested. Child welfare officials took custody of Maria, then 14.

Maryland Department of Human Services spokesperson Lilly Price said the agency couldn't comment on specific cases because of confidentiality laws but noted in a statement that adoptive parents are responsible for applying for U.S. citizenship for children adopted from other countries.

Court documents show Sykes admitted sexually assaulting Maria multiple times but he claimed the assaults stopped in June 1990.

He was later convicted of child abuse. Though he had no prior criminal record, court officials acknowledged a history of similar behavior, records show.

Between credit for time served and a suspended prison sentence, Sykes spent about two months in jail.

Sykes' younger sister Leslie Parrish said she's often wondered what happened to Maria.

""He ruined her life,"" she said, weeping. ""There's a special place in hell for people like that.""

Parrish said she wanted to believe her brother had good intentions; he seemed committed to becoming a father and joined a social group for adoptive parents of foreign kids. She even accompanied him to Brazil.

But in hindsight, she sees it differently. She believes sinister motives lurked ""in the back of his sick mind.""

At family gatherings, Maria didn't show obvious signs of distress, though the language barrier made communication difficult. Other behavior was explained away as the result of her troubled childhood in the orphanage, Parrish said.

""But behind closed doors, I don't know what happened.""

Years in prison, an eventual release

Pires' teenage years were hard. She drank too much and got kicked out of school for fighting. She ran away from foster homes, including places where people cared for her deeply.

""If ever there was a child who was cheated out of life, it was Maria,"" one foster mother wrote in later court filings. ""She is a beautiful person, but she has had a hard life for someone so young.""

She struggled to provide for herself, sometimes ending up homeless. ""My trauma was real bad,"" she said. ""I was on my own.""

She became angry and violent. She would fight anyone who crossed her.

At 18, she pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for the roller rink attack. She served two years in prison, where she finally learned basic reading and writing skills. It was then that authorities — and Pires herself — discovered she wasn't a U.S. citizen.

Her criminal record meant it would be extremely difficult to gain citizenship. Suddenly, she faced deportation.

Pires said she hadn't realized the potential consequences when accepting her plea deal.

""If l had any idea that I could be deported because of this, I would not have agreed to it,"" she wrote, according to court records. ""Going to jail was one thing, but I will lose everything if I am deported back to Brazil.""

A team of volunteer lawyers and advocates argued she shouldn't be punished for something beyond her control.

""Maria has absolutely no one and nothing in Brazil. She would be completely lost there,"" an attorney wrote in a 1999 letter to immigration officials.

Ultimately, the American judicial system agreed: Pires would be allowed to remain in the United States if she checked in annually with ICE, a fairly common process until Trump's second term.

""How's your mental?""

Pires didn't immediately take advantage of her second chance.

She was arrested for cocaine distribution in 2004 and for check fraud in 2007. While incarcerated, she picked up charges for stabbing her cellmate in the eye, burning an inmate with a flat iron and throwing hot water on a correctional officer. Her sentence was extended.

Pires said she spent several years in solitary confinement, exacerbating her mental health challenges.

Her release in 2017 marked a new beginning. Through therapy and other support services, she learned to manage her anger and stay out of trouble. She gave up drinking. She started working long days in construction. She checked in every year with immigration agents.

But in 2023, work dried up and she fell behind on rent. She felt her mental health slipping. She applied for a women's transitional housing program in Baltimore.

Pires thrived there. With no high school diploma and only second-grade reading skills, she qualified for a state-run job training course to polish and refinish floors. Photos show her smiling broadly in a blue graduation gown.

Friends say Pires may have a tough exterior, but she's known for thinking of others first. She often greets people with a cheerful question: ""How's your mental?"" It's her way of acknowledging that everyone carries some sort of burden.

""This is a person who just yearns for family,"" said Britney Jones, Pires' former roommate. ""She handles things with so much forgiveness and grace.""

The two were living together when Pires went to downtown Baltimore on March 6 for her annual immigration check-in. She never returned.

A crackdown on ""the worst of the worst""

When President Donald Trump campaigned for a second term, he doubled down on promises to carry out mass deportations. Within hours of taking office, he signed a series of executive orders, targeting what he called ""the worst of the worst"" — murderers, rapists, gang members. The goal, officials have said, is 1 million deportations a year.

In March, Pires showed up at the immigration office with paperwork listing all her check-ins over the past eight years. This time, instead of receiving another compliance report, she was immediately handcuffed and detained.

""The government failed her,"" attorney Jim Merklinger said. ""They allowed this to happen.""

Given that she was adopted into the country as a child, she shouldn't be punished for something that was out of her hands from the start, he said.

Her March arrest sparked a journey across America's immigration detention system. From Baltimore, she was sent to New Jersey and Louisiana before landing at Eloy Detention Center in Arizona.

She tried to stay positive. Although Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric made her nervous, Pires reminded herself that the system granted her leniency in the past. She told her friends back home not to worry.

A deportation priority

On June 2, in an email exchange obtained by AP, an ICE agent asked to have Pires prioritized for a deportation flight to Brazil leaving in four days.

""I would like to keep her as low profile as possible,"" the agent wrote.

Her lawyer tried to stop the deportation, calling Maryland politicians, ICE officials and Brazilian diplomats.

""This is a woman who followed all the rules,"" Merklinger said. ""This should not be happening.""

He received terrified calls from Pires, who was suddenly transferred to a detention facility near Alexandria, Louisiana, a common waypoint for deportation flights.

Finally, Pires said, she was handcuffed, shackled, put on a bus with dozens of other detainees, driven to the Alexandria airport and loaded onto an airplane. There was a large group of Brazilians on the flight, which was a relief, though she spoke hardly any Portuguese after so many years in the U.S.

""I was just praying to God,"" she said. ""Maybe this is his plan.""

After two stops to drop off other deportees, they arrived in the Brazilian port city of Fortaleza.

Starting from scratch back in Brazil

Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women's shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.

She has spent months there trying to get Brazilian identification documents. She began relearning Portuguese — listening to conversations around her and watching TV.

Most of her belongings are in a Baltimore storage unit, including DJ equipment and a tripod she used for recording videos — two of her passions.

In Brazil, she has almost nothing. She depends on the shelter for necessities such as soap and toothpaste. But she maintains a degree of hope.

""I've survived all these years,"" Pires said. ""I can survive again.""

She can't stop thinking about her birth family. Years ago, she got a tattoo of her mother's middle name. Now more than ever, she wants to know where she came from. ""I still have that hole in my heart,"" she said.

Above all, she hopes to return to America. Her attorney recently filed an application for citizenship. But federal officials say that's not happening.

""She was an enforcement priority because of her serial criminal record,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email. ""Criminals are not welcome in the U.S.""

Every morning, Pires wakes up and keeps trying to build a new life. She's applied for Brazilian work authorization, but getting a job will probably be difficult until her Portuguese improves. She's been researching language classes and using her limited vocabulary to communicate with other shelter residents.

In moments of optimism, she imagines herself working as a translator, earning a decent salary and renting a nice apartment.

She wonders if God's plan will ever become clear.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250911-maria-pires-mb-1430-968659.jpg",N,,2025-09-11 18:56:57.657550

On September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court agreed to expedited review of two appeals concerning the legality of the Trump administration's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including fentanyl and immigration-related tariffs on products of Canada, Mexico, and China (Trafficking Tariffs), and the reciprocal tariffs imposed on products of most countries (Reciprocal Tariffs) (together with the Trafficking Tariffs, the IEEPA Tariffs). Recent court decisions, including the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision finding that the IEEPA Tariffs exceeded the president's authority, represent a significant setback for the administration's efforts to use the executive's emergency power under IEEPA to impose tariffs.

Despite the Federal Circuit's decision, and similar holdings from the district courts, the IEEPA Tariffs remain in effect pending review by the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court overturns the lower court decisions on this issue, the IEEPA Tariffs will remain in effect. The Supreme Court could also remand without deciding whether the tariffs are legal, leaving the lower courts to continue addressing them on a case-by-case basis. Even if the IEEPA Tariffs are struck down by the Supreme Court, importers will face an uncertain timeline to recover funds already collected by the government. Importers therefore need to be proactive in preserving their rights while these cases are pending.

Importers should take steps to maximize their chance of obtaining tariff refunds. This includes closely monitoring the liquidation of entries on which IEEPA Tariffs were paid, asking U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to extend the liquidation timeframe for those entries, and filing protests when the entries are liquidated.

What Tariffs Are at Issue?

The plaintiffs have sued President Trump and other administration officials in the Court of International Trade (CIT) and the District Court for the District of Columbia for improperly invoking IEEPA to impose tariffs on products from Mexico (Executive Orders (E.O.) 14194 and 14198), China (E.O.s 14195 and 14228), and Canada (E.O. 14197) based on presidential declarations of national emergencies concerning drug trafficking and migration (the aforementioned Trafficking Tariffs). The cases also challenge the universal reciprocal tariff program based on a presidential declaration of national emergency concerning the trade deficit (E.O. 14257) that imposed a baseline 10 percent tariff on most countries and the country-specific rates that followed (the aforementioned Reciprocal Tariffs). The pending litigation also addresses subsequent amendments to the IEEPA Tariffs programs under separate executive orders.

There are also several other recent tariff measures, including some levied under IEEPA, that have not been directly challenged under the current proceedings. These tariffs include the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, automobile parts, and copper, which were imposed under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and section 301 tariffs on certain China-origin goods imposed under the Trade Act of 1974.

Further, the plaintiffs in the proceedings before the courts have not explicitly challenged several tariffs issued under IEEPA, including the 40 percent tariff on Brazil-origin goods and the 25 percent tariff on India-origin goods. However, those tariffs are similarly at risk of being overturned if the Supreme Court determines that IEEPA does not authorize issuance of tariffs.

The table below lists all Trump administration tariffs in chronological order.

What Have Federal District Courts Said About IEEPA Tariffs?

Two district court decisions have addressed the legality of IEEPA tariffs.

First, in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00066 (Ct Int'l Trade, Apr. 14, 2025), the CIT held that IEEPA does not grant the president authority to ""impose unbounded tariffs"" (with respect to the Reciprocal Tariffs) or to impose tariffs on lawful imports in response to an unrelated trafficking and crime problem (with respect to the Trafficking Tariffs). The CIT ordered a universal, permanent injunction on the challenged tariffs, which was stayed by Federal Circuit during the government's appeal and remains stayed now as the case proceeds to the Supreme Court. The CIT's decision was recently upheld by the Federal Circuit in the V.O.S. Selections decision discussed below.

Second, a federal district court in Washington, DC, similarly held that the IEEPA Tariffs exceed the president's authority. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-1248 (RC), 2025 WL 1525376, at *6 (D.D.C. May 29, 2025), the court held that IEEPA does not grant the executive the authority to impose tariffs, and therefore, that the government's tariffs are in violation of the non-delegation doctrine and separation of powers, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) – a ruling that goes still further than the CIT in invalidating the IEEPA Tariffs. The district court also found that the CIT did not have jurisdiction to address the legality of the tariffs.

Both decisions are now on appeal and have been consolidated for joint review by the Supreme Court.

What Have the Courts of Appeals Decided?

On August 29, 2025, in a per curiam decision signed by seven of the 11 judges who heard the case, the Federal Circuit affirmed the CIT's decision while vacating the universal permanent injunction on the IEEPA Tariffs and remanded the case for further evaluation of whether a universal injunction is proper.

In upholding the CIT's decision striking down the IEEPA Tariffs, the panel emphasized that the power to levy taxes, including tariffs, is expressly delegated to Congress under Article 1 § 8 of the Constitution. Further, for much of the nation's history, statutory delegations of tariff authority to the president were highly limited, involving only the authority to reduce or increase tariff rates through international agreements, rather than the authority to create new tariffs from whole cloth.

Then, addressing the text of IEEPA, the panel noted that, although IEEPA ""bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, [] none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.""

In contrast, the panel noted that other trade laws that grant authority to issue tariffs have done so explicitly, in ""clear and precise terms."" And despite the fact that IEEPA was promulgated nearly 50 years ago, and has been invoked frequently by presidents, no past president has used IEEPA to impose tariffs on imports or adjust tariff rates. Taking these facts together, the panel explained that:

whenever Congress intends to delegate to the President the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an over-all structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs. This is no surprise, as the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution; when Congress delegates this power in the first instance, it does so clearly and unambiguously.

Because IEEPA has no such unambiguous delegation of authority, the court concluded that the administration's tariffs issued under IEEPA were contrary to statute, and as such, unlawful.

Notwithstanding this decision, the panel vacated the universal permanent injunction on enforcing IEEPA Tariffs that was ordered by the CIT, remanding the issue for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's June decision in Trump v. Casa. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that universal injunctions ""likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts."" The Federal Circuit therefore directed the district court to determine whether a universal injunction was permitted under the equitable principles addressed in Casa.

While joining in the majority decision, Judges Cunningham, Lourie, Reyna, and Stark also submitted an additional opinion stating their view that ""IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose any tariffs"" at all. The concurrence based this conclusion on the plain language of IEEPA, finding that any tariff issued by the president under IEEPA would exceed Congress's delegation of authority.

Finally, Judges Taranto, Prost, Chen, and Chief Judge Moore dissented, stating the view that ""IEEPA's language, as confirmed by its history, authorizes tariffs to regulate importation"" under statutorily defined conditions, including ""unusual and extraordinary threat, having foreign sources, to the national security or foreign policy or economy of the United States, the threat declared as a national emergency..."" According to the dissenting judges: ""IEEPA embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities available under non-emergency laws,"" and includes authority to issue tariffs like those in question here.

The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was set to hear oral arguments in Learning Resources on September 30, 2025. However, both plaintiffs and the government have agreed that the DC Circuit should hold the case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court case.

What Are the Next Steps in the IEEPA Tariff Appeals?

On September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government's request for expedited review of the V.O.S Selections decision. The Supreme Court also consolidated the DC and Federal Circuit cases and set a deadline of October 30, 2025, for completion of all briefing. Oral argument is calendared the first week of November 2025 and a decision is likely to follow shortly thereafter. In light of this order, the Federal Circuit's ruling in V.O.S. Selections is stayed automatically. The DC Circuit is also likely to stay proceedings in Learning Resources.

Despite lower court orders finding the IEEPA tariffs unlawful, those tariffs will remain in effect until a final determination is reached. Further, as noted above, the appeal before the Supreme Court does not apply to tariffs issued under other laws, such as the 50 percent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from other trading partners, which were issued under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

What Are Possible Outcomes to this Litigation?

There are several possible outcomes to the ongoing tariffs litigation, each with different implications for importers. Here are a few of the potential paths forward:

The Supreme Court could find that the IEEPA Tariffs are valid and imposed within the president's emergency authority under IEEPA. If it does, we expect the IEEPA Tariffs to continue under their existing parameters and importers will be required to pay these duties on all imports until the IEEPA Tariffs are lifted.

The Supreme Court could remand one or both cases without deciding the legality of the IEEPA Tariffs challenged on appeal. Although IEEPA had never been used to impose tariffs before the current administration, the Supreme Court may find that IEEPA authorizes the executive to regulate trade by imposing tariffs, without deciding specifically whether the administration's tariffs are lawful. If it does so, the Supreme Court may use this opportunity to establish parameters that provide boundaries on the use of IEEPA's authority. These parameters could include, for example, being narrowly tailored to fit the stated emergency or further defining what qualifies as an ""usual and extraordinary threat."" With these guiderails in place, the Court could remand the issue to the lower courts to address whether the IEEPA Tariffs satisfy the criteria.

The Supreme Court could also avoid deciding the legality of the IEEPA Tariffs altogether by deciding the case solely on a jurisdictional basis. The Supreme Court may find that the CIT holds exclusive jurisdiction (or conversely, that the DC district court has general jurisdiction) over the tariffs matter and remand these cases to the appropriate lower court without making a finding on the merits. This is a key point where the Federal and DC Circuits differed (and a key reason why the matters have been consolidated to appear together before the Supreme Court): The Federal Circuit determined that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction to review litigation related to the validity of tariffs, while the DC district court found that the CIT did not have any jurisdiction because the executive's powers under IEEPA did not include ""the power to tariff."" A jurisdictional ruling could side-step the merits of the IEEPA Tariffs but would have the effect of upholding the lower court's holding. From there, the lower court would have to determine the scope of equitable relief appropriate under the standard in Trump v. Casa.

The Supreme Court could hold that IEEPA does not grant the president the power to enact any tariffs. As noted above, the Federal Circuit held that only the tariffs specifically challenged in the V.O.S. Selections litigation were unlawful; however, the concurrence went further and held that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of any tariffs. If the Supreme Court follows the concurrence, CBP would be required to refund the IEEPA Tariffs and end further collections.

The government has argued that this outcome would impose an extraordinary burden. An order striking down the IEEPA Tariffs would also call into question the trade agreements made with other nations in response to the recently enacted tariffs, particularly the Reciprocal Tariffs. In an August 11, 2025, letter to the Federal Circuit, the government noted that ""[t]he President believes that our country would not be able to pay back the trillions of dollars that other countries have already committed to pay, which could lead to financial ruin,"" including ""a 1929-style result.""

The Supreme Court could hold that some (but not all) of the IEEPA Tariffs are illegal. There are several tariffs under consideration, and the Court may find that only certain tariffs – or certain elements of the IEEPA Tariffs – are valid under IEEPA. In that case, the remaining portions would be struck down, and the government would no longer have authority to collect tariffs outside those authorized by the Supreme Court's decision. CBP would also have to find a mechanism to refund previously collected, but now invalidated, tariffs.

If Plaintiffs Win On Appeal, Will Importers Be Able to Collect Refunds for Tariffs Already Paid?

If the Supreme Court finds that some or all of the IEEPA Tariffs were implemented unlawfully, the government will face demands to refund the IEEPA Tariffs that were already collected, which could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.

The government has argued that this outcome would create an extraordinary burden, but it has acknowledged that if the IEEPA Tariffs are overturned, the tariffs already paid would need to be returned. On September 7, 2025, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent agreed that ""[the Treasury] would have to refund roughly half the tariffs, which would be a major blow to the Treasury."" Bessent also stated that ""[i]f the court rules that way, we'll have no choice but to comply.""

However, there is significant uncertainty about how the government would implement such refunds, what procedural hurdles importers would face in claiming the funds they are owed, and how long it would take to receive any payments. Further, the Supreme Court's decision may not resolve the legality of all IEEPA Tariffs, leaving continued uncertainty about the payment obligations for any tariffs that remain in effect. In light of these factors, importers are advised to take steps to protect their ability to obtain tariff refunds.

How Can Importers Protect Their Ability to Recover Tariffs They Have Already Paid?

Given the myriad paths forward in the IEEPA Tariffs litigation, importers should consider taking steps to preserve their rights and ability to claim timely refunds.

Track entry liquidations. While Supreme Court review is pending, importers should ensure that they have an internal process to track the liquidation (i.e., the final calculation of duties) of entries on which IEEPA Tariffs were paid. Importers are encouraged to maintain records of all documents associated with those entries, including entry summaries, commercial invoices, and proof of payments made to CBP.

Request extensions to pending liquidations. 19 U.S.C § 1504 requires CBP to liquidate entries within one year of the date of entry. However, under statute, this period can be extended by up to three years if an importer requests such an extension and shows good cause. An extension would give CBP additional time to apply the final legal outcome to the entries. It would also delay the start of 180-day statutory timeline to file protests on liquidated entries.

File protests if extensions are denied. Entries are typically liquidated 314 days from the date of entry. Because the tariffs were imposed earlier this year, most affected entries have not yet liquidated. When they do, and if extensions to pending liquidations are not granted, importers should consider filing protests to challenge CBP's liquidation of the entries. Importers should also consider requesting that the protest review be suspended until the IEEPA cases reach a final merits-based resolution.

If protests are denied, consider legal action. If the Supreme Court grants a favorable outcome, but does not establish a process for refunds, and protests are denied, then importers that have paid IEEPA Tariffs may consider filing their own lawsuits challenging the tariffs and seeking reimbursement. Pending the scope of relief resulting from this litigation, importers may want to keep an eye on class action lawsuits that potentially unfold that challenge the grounds of these IEEPA tariffs.

There are many possible paths forward and a decision by the Supreme Court may not be the final word in IEEPA Tariffs litigation. It is important that the import community closely follow the developments in this litigation and take action to preserve the ability to seek refunds if the IEEPA Tariffs are found to be unlawful.

Miller & Chevalier frequently advises clients on issues related to imports and tariffs, including on coordinating responses to the IEEPA Tariffs addressed in this article.

“Head Start programs in Washington see every day how Head Start strengthens families and uplifts entire communities.
With so many attacks against our immigrant community, ensuring they do not lose access to Head Start is a tremendous win for children and families.
Below are statements from litigators: “Today the court was clear: HHS does not have the authority to impose an immigration-based restriction on Head Start families,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU.
“Under the law, access to these critical programs has never been — and should never be — based on immigration status.”","SEATTLE – In a win for working families, a federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction effectively blocking an exclusionary directive of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS), which sought to shut out immigrant families from participating in Head Start based on their immigration status for the first time in the program’s history since it was created in 1965. The ruling prevents the HHS directive from going into effect and enjoins the government from implementing or enforcing it against any Head Start agencies, program providers, student or family participants, or other similar persons.

“This ruling is a powerful affirmation that every child, no matter their background or immigration status, deserves access to early education and support,” said Joel Ryan, executive director of theWashington State Head Start & Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program. “Head Start programs in Washington see every day how Head Start strengthens families and uplifts entire communities. The court’s decision allows us to keep serving the children and families who need us most.”

“Today’s decision is a powerful step toward protecting access to early education and care for Head Start children and families all across the nation,” said Candice Williams, executive director of Family Forward Oregon. “This ruling ensures some stability for families and caregivers during a tumultuous time in our country. With so many attacks against our immigrant community, ensuring they do not lose access to Head Start is a tremendous win for children and families. This is only one win of many to come! We will not stop fighting.”

The directive, which was issued this past July, aimed to reinterpret the definition of “federal public benefit” under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) to include Head Start — effectively making many immigrant children ineligible for the first time in the program’s history. This action has created confusion and fear among providers and families alike, leading young children to lose critical education.

In April, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, the ACLU of Washington, the ACLU of Illinois, the Impact Fund, filed a lawsuit on behalf of Parent Voices Oakland and Family Forward Oregon, and the Head Start Associations of Washington state, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

In July, plaintiffs sought emergency relief to stop HHS’ latest directive, which seeks to exclude many immigrant families from accessing early childhood education by restricting participation in Head Start based on immigration status.

Below are statements from litigators:

“Today the court was clear: HHS does not have the authority to impose an immigration-based restriction on Head Start families,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU. “No child and no family should have to fear accessing critical early learning services, and we will continue to defend the families that Head Start aims to serve.”

“Our Constitution establishes a three-part system of government to make sure there are checks and balances on the power of any one branch to radically undermine American values and democracy,” said Lori Rifkin, litigation director at the Impact Fund. “Today, the court protected our democratic process by upholding the goals of Congress in establishing the Head Start program and rejecting the Trump Administration's illegal attempt to deny children crucial educational opportunities based on immigration status.”

“The court today protected the children and families that rely on Head Start across Washington state. Head Start programs provide crucial early learning support not only to the children and families that participate in them, but also entire communities facing barriers created by systemic inequality and racism,"" said Brent Low, ACLU of Washington staff attorney. “Under the law, access to these critical programs has never been — and should never be — based on immigration status.”",https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-types/fallback-press-release.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 16:57:48.935581

As the immigration officials were leaving, it was discovered that someone had slashed the tires on a Border Patrol vehicle, Barnhart and others said.
Barnhart, other local officials and immigration advocates said they did not condone the slashing of the tires.
The city first passed a resolution in 1986 in support of refugees and limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities.","When immigration agents went to a roofing job site this week in Rochester, New York, they were quickly met with a crowd of protesters who came out to defend workers who stayed on the roof of a home, according to officials and advocates at the scene.

A group of men were working on the roof of a private, multifamily house when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other federal law enforcement arrived midmorning Tuesday, according to a statement to NBC News from Democratic Assemblymember Jen Lunsford, who was at the scene and spoke to witnesses there.

A local resident saw what was happening and called a rapid response network, which alerted immigration advocacy groups, protesters, faith leaders and officials who arrived at the home, Lunsford said in the statement.

Rachel Barnhart, a Monroe County legislator, told NBC News that recently ICE has been “very active” in the Western New York region and taking workers into custody. But this was the first time that the local community was alerted in real time and more than 100 people, including Barnhart, were able to come out as the event was happening, she said.

“I saw two people sitting on the roof. It was frankly heartbreaking. The ICE agents were in the backyard, and in the front, a crowd was gathering,” she said. “People were displaying hand signs to the men. They were telling them to stay strong. It was a very peaceful crowd.”

One worker was arrested, but two other men remained on the roof as protesters gathered, according to Maria Garcia, the program director of the Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies, a nonprofit that supports farmworkers and migrant families.

Garcia said that with the permission of the homeowner, she went onto the roof to talk with the two men and offer to speak with ICE agents on their behalf. The coalition also provided them with water and snacks as they remained on the roof.

Garcia said immigration officials told her they did not have warrants for the business, property or individuals.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that on Tuesday it arrested Jacinto Mayancela Guallpa, an Ecuadorian immigrant who the agency said was in the country illegally.

As ICE was making the arrest, two others “fled up to a rooftop and refused to come down,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

McLaughlin said the men had confirmed to law enforcement that they did not have legal status to be in the U.S. She said an attorney for the men on the roof agreed to bring them to an ICE processing center later that day.

She described the crowd as “violent rioters” who “attempted to prevent law enforcement from exercising their sworn duties.”

“These dangerous rioters vandalized and slashed the tires of a border patrol vehicle. For their own safety, officers left the scene,” McLaughlin said.

She added that an attorney never showed up at the ICE office with the other workers. The department did not respond to a request for comment on whether the agents had a warrant.

As the immigration officials were leaving, it was discovered that someone had slashed the tires on a Border Patrol vehicle, Barnhart and others said.

Barnhart, other local officials and immigration advocates said they did not condone the slashing of the tires.

Garcia and others disputed DHS’ claim that the protesters were violent. She said the crowd was simply exercising its First Amendment rights.

“People are just hurt. They’re angry. Families are being separated. Communities are being torn apart. It becomes personal,” she said. “So I can see why it could be misconstrued, but it was peaceful all around. It was a beautiful sight to see.”

Barnhart said the crowd was “very restrained” and “peaceful.”

“There were a lot of elected officials, there were a lot of pastors, a lot of elders in the community, a lot of neighbors, community leaders,” Barnhart said.

Lunsford said in her statement that she was told the man who was arrested had a valid work permit. She was told he has been in the U.S. for 25 years with no criminal history and has a family.

“When civil rights are indiscriminately violated, it is a threat to the rights of everyone, everywhere,” she said.

Barnhart said that “people felt jubilant that ICE left, but are still horrified at what’s going on in our country right now — mass deportations and the lack of due process.”

“At least in that case, the community was able to come together in a way that was really meaningful and show solidarity,” she said.

The Trump administration sued Rochester earlier this year over its sanctuary city policies. The city first passed a resolution in 1986 in support of refugees and limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. It passed an updated resolution in 2017.

Rochester codified an expanded sanctuary city policy last month that also added protections for the LGBTQ community.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/25-826-ice-agent-ch-1117-b6bb08.jpg",N,,2025-09-11 16:57:54.666313

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17.

Nearly all the children were in the custody of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Office of Refugee Resettlement and living at shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Similar lawsuits filed in Illinois and Washington, D.C., seek to stop the government from removing the children.

“ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.
Students who are undocumented immigrants or live in mixed-status households are not the only youth impacted by the immigration crackdown.","When Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested a 38-year-old chiropractor while he was dropping his daughter off, they reportedly smashed out the windows of his car. The arrest, which happened on July 15, took place outside the child’s preschool in South Beaverton, Oregon. The father, originally from Iran, is married to a U.S. citizen who said he has applied for a green card to remain in the United States legally, according to Oregon Public Media.

Randy Kornfield, who witnessed the arrest while taking his grandson to the same school, told a reporter it was “heartless” to arrest a father dropping his kid off. ICE said in a statement that the child was “unharmed.”

“These poor kids don’t know what’s going on,” Kornfield said at the time.

School principal Amy Lomanto witnessed the violent arrest and managed the school’s emergency response to the incident. The arrest has led to a decrease in attendance and “has shaken our community to the core,” according to a statement from the school and a complaint filed in federal court on September 10. Along with the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, two unions representing about 5 million educators, Lomanto is among the latest plaintiffs to join a lawsuit challenging immigration enforcement in spaces where safety is considered a sacred value, such as hospitals, houses of worships, and schools

Originally filed in April by a coalition of churches and community groups, the lawsuit challenges a Trump administration policy implemented in January that allows ICE agents to make arrests at school and churches, which were previously considered off limits. With students returning from summer break, educators and parents are calling on school boards to swiftly take steps to protect children and their families from ICE in and around schools as President Donald Trump’s accelerating mass deportation campaign spreads fear of racial profiling and state violence.

“By targeting schools, Donald Trump’s ICE is creating fear and chaos, and our students, their families and communities are paying the price for these traumatic and extreme immigration actions,” said Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, in a statement on September 10. “We have a professional and moral responsibility to keep our students safe.”

As the challenge makes its way through the legal system, education and racial justice advocates are searching for other ways to protect school communities from ICE. Leidy Robledo, a youth development specialist at the Alliance for Education Justice, said school leaders should demand that local police and city leaders do not work with ICE and provide staff with protocols and training for what to do if ICE agents show up at school. School officials and city leaders should also invest in counselors and after school programs for kids, not surveillance, punishment, and policing, Robledo said.

“ICE has been reported outside of schools, at bus stops, and in neighborhoods where children are walking to and from class,” Robledo said during a webinar on September 10. “For immigrant students, simply walking into school can feel like stepping into danger, and we believe that no young person should have to choose between their education and their family’s safety.”

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, issued a statement on September 9 accusing the media of “force-feeding” the public stories about children and parents being “scared to return to school” and claimed that ICE does not “raid or target schools.” The statement includes screengrabs from news reports about educators navigating fear of ICE among students and parents and preparing for potential encounters with immigration police as the new school year begins.

“ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. “Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

However, McLaughlin and DHS provided no evidence that “criminals” are using the nation’s schools as a hiding place. About 70 percent of the more than 61,000 people currently by ICE have no criminal convictions, and many others were convicted only of misdemeanors, including traffic tickets. While large-scale immigration raids have swept up people in public areas and adults at places of work, ICE is also arresting people at immigration hearings inside public buildings, and reports of ICE agents targeting parents dropping kids off at school and detaining high school students have sparked fear and confusion in communities across the country.

Students who are undocumented immigrants or live in mixed-status households are not the only youth impacted by the immigration crackdown. Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, senior attorney and director and of the Opportunity to Learn Program at Advancement Project, a civil rights group, said the Trump administration policies aimed at terrorizing immigrant families have made schools less safe for all students.

“The latest Supreme Court decision allows ICE to use racial profiling to violate the constitutional rights of Black and Latine Americans, disrupting the lives of immigrant families across the country when they should be celebrating their children at the start of the new school year,” Onyeka-Crawford said.

On September 8, the Supreme Court paused a ruling by a federal judge in Los Angeles that imposed restrictions on federal agents making immigration stops and arrests that plaintiffs and critics say amount to blatant racial profiling. The initial ruling was made on July 11 by a federal judge for the Central District of California, and barred ICE and Border Patrol agents from stopping people without “reasonable suspicion” that they are undocumented.

The judge ruled that “reasonable suspicion” cannot rest solely on any combination of four factors: “apparent race or ethnicity,” speaking in Spanish or accented English, being present at a location where immigrants “are known to gather” (such as Home Depot locations, where day laborers often come together and which have become noted areas for ICE raids), and working at specific jobs, such as landscaping or construction. The Supreme Court’s liberal justices dissented with the decision to overturn the lower court order. In a 21-page opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the decision as “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

Trump’s mass deportation campaign is a nationwide effort, but the administration has singled out Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other large cities with Democratic leadership for immigration sweeps and raids, which has sparked mass protests and community self-defense efforts.

As litigation over the administration’s crackdown continues, advocates say immigrants — and people who are perceived as immigrants — are at risk of being disappeared into remote immigration jails without due process, as viral videos of masked agents making violent arrests fuel fears. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus announced a new “Learning Without Fear” campaign on September 9, an effort to call attention to drops in school registration and attendance “caused by fear of irresponsible federal immigration enforcement.” The caucus announced the campaign on social media but did not elaborate on what it would accomplish. Research shows that anxiety and fear around immigration status fuels disparities in academic achievement among students who are undocumented or live with undocumented family members.

As a result of Trump’s crackdown, children are afraid to leave home, parents are making plans in case they are disappeared, and teachers across the country are adopting protocols in case of an encounter with ICE, according to Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the immigrant rights group America’s Voice.

“This is the high cost of Trump’s mass deportation agenda — not just economic devastation, but educational chaos and psychological scarring,” Cárdenas said in a statement on Wednesday. “The worst part? It’s by design.”

A POLITICO investigation last month found that immigration enforcement agencies are increasingly tapping into massive personal data troves — while Congress has lagged on passing comprehensive data privacy laws.","WASHINGTON — Two California Democrats are moving to cut off the Trump administration’s pipeline to sensitive personal data as federal agencies deepen their cooperation with ICE in support of mass deportations.

On Friday, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.) introduced the Limiting ICE’s Nationwide Encroachment Act (LINE Act), which would prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from sharing Medicaid records with immigration enforcement.

The bill explicitly bars the disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected through Medicaid enrollment — including home addresses and medical histories — to ICE or any other agency for immigration purposes.

Her colleague Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) rolled out the Home Together Act, which would prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from disclosing public housing records for immigration enforcement. The measure also prohibits HUD from compelling local housing authorities to share resident data and requires a public accounting of any prior disclosures to immigration officials.

The twin bills arrive just weeks after the Trump administration announced new interagency agreements giving DHS unprecedented access to personal data held by HHS, CMS, and HUD. Those agreements, according to administration officials, would allow ICE to identify undocumented residents by combing through benefits databases — a move Democrats blasted as a weaponization of the social safety net.

“These bills are about drawing a line in the sand,” Kamlager-Dove said at a press conference unveiling the legislation. “Trump wants to turn doctors, nurses, and housing officials into extensions of ICE. We’re saying no. Medicaid and housing assistance exist to help families survive, not to help deport them.”

Vargas underscored the risk to families already facing a housing crisis. “If immigrants fear their housing records could be weaponized against them, they will retreat into the shadows,” he said. “That makes our communities less safe, less stable, and more unequal.”

The administration’s moves have already sparked alarm among privacy advocates. A POLITICO investigation last month found that immigration enforcement agencies are increasingly tapping into massive personal data troves — while Congress has lagged on passing comprehensive data privacy laws.

Together, the LINE Act and Home Together Act reflect an emerging Democratic strategy to blunt Trump’s deportation campaign by choking off access to federal databases — a front line in what is quickly becoming Washington’s fiercest fight over data, privacy, and immigration enforcement.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grc7!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd501c058-323b-42d7-b201-67f9440dc44b_2560x1384.png",N,,2025-09-11 18:56:48.095749

Across August, an average of 45 ICE flights took off per day, either to deport immigrants or move them elsewhere within the United States, per the ICE Flight Monitor housed at the nonprofit Human Rights First, making it the busiest month since records began in 2020.

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment via email Thursday afternoon.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump promised his administration would carry out the mass deportation of millions of illegal immigrants once he returned to the White House in January. While slow to begin with, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, gave a multi-billion-dollar boost to ICE's budget, providing funding for extra staff and detention capacity.

What To Know

ICE Flight Monitor said that between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the Trump administration carried out at least 7,454 enforcement flights, marking a 34 percent increase over the same period in 2024 when President Joe Biden was in office.

In August alone, there were 1,393 ICE flights, the data showed, with around 240 of those counted as removal, or deportation, flights out of the country. That number had only moved above 200 in May, when 209 were recorded.

The other flights included in the monitor's totals—gathered through independent tracking due to no official government data—are removal-related flights, meaning planes linking up deportation efforts, and domestic ""shuffles"", referring to ICE flights which move detainees between the agency's various detention centers.

More shuffle flights have been recorded under the Trump administration, likely due to a rapidly growing detention center line-up and a record number of ICE detainees.

Most of the flights leaving the U.S. were headed for Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, with nationals from those four countries making up some of the largest shares of known undocumented immigrants in the U.S. New destinations recorded under the second Trump administration included: Greece, Pakistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Chile, and Kazakhstan.

Human Rights First raised concerns about the conditions on board the planes, with many deportees held in handcuffs or shackles for the entire flight, which can stop off in multiple countries and last more than 30 hours.

The Trump administration has insisted that ICE detainees receive high standards of care, while also maintaining that those being deported have broken U.S. laws and must be sent home or to a third country.

What People Are Saying

Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First, in a press release: ""Behind every flight are families torn apart, people disappeared without due process, and human rights violated on an industrial scale. The Trump administration's deportation campaign is unprecedented in scope and cruelty and is a clear attack on due process, the rule of law, and overall transparency of our immigration system.""

Human Rights First President and CEO Uzra Zeya, in a press release: ""U.S. democracy is strengthened when Americans know where their tax dollars are going – in this case, a mushrooming deportation machine fueled by an unprecedented $170 billion cash infusion to DHS and its components. We need Congress and the courts to rein in this anti-democratic enforcement overreach.""

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official on the arrests of alleged illegal immigrants in late August: ""We've said it before, and we'll keep saying it: If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we WILL find you, arrest, you, and deport you. The days of letting dangerous criminals terrorize American citizens are over. President Trump and Secretary Noem will continue to do everything in their power to fulfill the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country.""

(AP) — A federal judge in Arizona temporarily blocked the Trump administration from removing dozens of Guatemalan and Honduran children living in shelters or foster care after coming to the U.S. alone, according to a decision Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Rosemary Márquez in Tucson extended until at least Sept. 26 a temporary restraining issued over the Labor Day weekend. Márquez raised concern over whether the government had arranged for any of the children's parents or legal guardians in Guatemala to take custody of them.

Laura Belous, attorney for the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, which represents the children, said in court that the minors had expressed no desire to be repatriated to their native countries of Guatemala and Honduras amid concerns they could face neglect, possible child trafficking or hardships associated with individual medical conditions.

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17.

Denise Ann Faulk, an assistant U.S. attorney under the Trump administration, emphasized that the child repatriations were negotiated at high diplomatic levels and would avoid lengthy prohibitions on returning to the U.S.

Nearly all the children were in the custody of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement and living at shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Similar lawsuits filed in Illinois and Washington, D.C., seek to stop the government from removing the children.

The Arizona lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in their best interest.

The Trump administration has argued it is acting in the best interest of the children by trying to reunite them with their families at the behest of the Guatemalan government. After Guatemalan officials toured U.S. detention facilities, the government said that it was “very concerned” and that it would take children who wanted to return voluntarily.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July’s arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The Arizona lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to an Arizona legal aid group that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the lawsuit was initially filed on Aug. 30.

Judge Márquez said she found it “frightening” that U.S. officials may not have coordinated with the childrens' parents. She also expressed concern that the government was denying the children access to review by an experienced immigration judge, and noted that legal representatives for the children were notified of preparations for child departures with little notice, late at night.

“On a practical matter, it just seems that a lot of these things that (the Office of Refugee Resettlement) has taken upon themselves to do — such as screening and making judicial determinations that should be made by an immigration judge with expertise and time to meet with a lawyer and meet with a child — is just surpassed by saying ‘we’re reuniting them’” with parents, Márquez said in court as she pressed Faulk for more information.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/sooleader/images/sooleader/sooleader_shareimage_1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:57:20.716122

The Trump administration’s latest ask of Congress called for a stopgap funding bill, also known as a continuing resolution (CR), to keep the lights on through January. But some Republicans worry the move would stick federal agencies with another year of flat funding.

“I just think that we get into January, get into the new year, that it’s less likely we’ll do any appropriation bills and we’ll have a yearlong CR,” Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a GOP spending cardinal, told The Hill on Tuesday.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who also serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday that while he recognizes Oct. 1 “is not a doable date” for appropriators to finish their annual funding work for fiscal 2026, he’s not “prepared to support a CR that’s a long-term extension.”

GOP appropriators in both chambers have been pushing for a stopgap to last through sometime in November, at the earliest, to keep pressure on lawmakers to finish their annual funding bills.

There’s also been bipartisan interest in using the coming deadline as pressure for lawmakers to hash out a bicameral funding deal that could allow Congress to approve three of its 12 annual funding bills by the end of the month and knocking out the rest with the stopgap.

“I don’t want to take the heat off of the Senate or the House and just getting our work done,” Rounds said. “And it’s a terrible thing to do to the Department of Defense to have continuing resolutions, which don’t allow us to actually move forward with some very critical new projects.”

Talking to reporters Tuesday, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who has pitched a stopgap through part of November, was noncommittal to reporters shortly after the White House’s request for a Jan. 31 deadline when pressed about the timeline Republicans might land on for a CR.

“I think that sentiment is probably still leaning toward something shorter, and that’s pretty much on both sides, and it’s basically with the idea to keep a sense of urgency,” he said, adding he thinks there’s some flexibility on the timeline.

“We’re not going to try to do something that Democrats are opposed to. We’re not trying to jam them here. We’re trying to work together with them,” he also said.

But there is growing appetite in the party’s right flank for another yearlong stopgap, similar to the outcome of Congress’s last shutdown fight in March, in a bid to reduce government spending, and they have expressed skepticism about ongoing efforts to pass fiscal 2026 funding bills in the coming weeks.

“If we want to do a very short CR into the middle of October to see if we can negotiate that minibus, that’s fine,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), a senior appropriator, said ahead of the White House’s request Tuesday. “But beyond that, I think you got to go into next year.”

He also expressed doubts about efforts for a bicameral deal on the full-year fiscal 2026 funding plan for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) — the bill crafted by the Appropriations subcommittee he chairs.

“If the purpose is to see if we can negotiate a successful minibus, but again, I’m skeptical about whether that can be done on the [agricultural funding bill], in terms of the level funding issue,” he said.

The bill is one of the three full-year funding plans that Republicans have been looking to pass as part of a minibus some are hopeful will ride alongside a stopgap this month. The two bills include annual funding plans for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the legislative branch operations.

This week, top Republicans pushed for what they’ve described as a “formal conference” to negotiate the funding bills. Cole also told reporters such a move would allow for more involvement from members.

“A formal one, everybody’s involved,” he said. “You get a much better reflection.”

“If you do an informal one, basically, it’s the subcommittee chairmen negotiating, the Big Four, sorting it out,” he said, referring to the four top funding negotiators in the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle. “I would prefer much more member involvement, and I know the Speaker would.”

Congress is facing a tight crunch on legislative time. Cole also acknowledged the timing constraints the Senate could face as part of the process.

“I don’t think that’s a reasonable possibility, because time,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a senior appropriator, told The Hill on Tuesday when asked about hopes of conferencing three funding bills to pass by the end of the month.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), the upper chamber’s funding chief overseeing USDA funding, said Tuesday that discussions are ongoing at the staff level in both chambers when asked about the chances of a bicameral deal on his subcommittee’s annual funding plan.

“Our staffs are working on it right now, OK, and trying to find out all the areas of agreement between our bill and theirs and any disagreement, and if we can include them, that’d be great.”

“But yeah, I think it’s going to be challenging,” he said.

With less than 20 days standing between Congress and the month’s end, tensions only seem to be rising.

In recent days, Democrats have warned their GOP colleagues not to expect a similar outcome for this month’s funding to what Washington witnessed in March — when Senate Democrats took a beating from their base for helping Republicans pass a GOP-crafted plan to keep the government open through early fall.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/moranjerry_050825gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-11 17:56:41.181235

Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in a 226-197 vote to pass the legislation, which is part of a wider tough-on-immigration push from President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers.

Among other changes, the bill would set a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years, and allow up to a life sentence, for migrants who either improperly enter or attempt to improperly enter the United States and then are convicted of a felony. The bill also would increase the maximum term of imprisonment from two to five years for repeated improper entry.

Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice, who sponsored the bill, issued a statement after the vote that the measure is necessary to respond to the immigration policies of former President Joe Biden, whom conservatives have criticized for allowing an influx of migrants into the United States.

“These individuals included people from countries designated as state sponsors of terror, with 400 illegal aliens on the Terrorist Watch List being encountered at the border,” Bice said. “We must deter future illegal immigration and give our law enforcement and border patrol officers the tools they need to remove dangerous criminals.”

All 11 Democrats who voted for the bill represent battleground seats and are Republican targets next year. They were Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas; Don Davis of North Carolina; Laura Gillen of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Vicente Gonzalez of Texas; Adam Gray of California; Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan; Frank J. Mrvan of Indiana; Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez of Washington; Tom Suozzi of New York; and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.

Democrats who opposed the measure said penalties are already in place for migrants who commit felonies in the United States and the legislation would bolster the harsh immigration policies of the Trump administration.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in floor remarks that migrants who enter the country and commit heinous crimes already face state penalties such as life in prison and the death penalty.

“I understand that it might be satisfying for us to say we’re just going to increase all these penalties, but we’re not in any way connecting with the worst of the worst,” Raskin said. “What are we really doing? We’re saying that we’re going to hold people who have done nothing other than enter the country illegally for much longer periods of time, for five or 10 years. And again, we see this as very wasteful in terms of public tax dollars.”

The bill also has provisions to increase prison sentences for migrants convicted of reentry after they have been removed multiple times from the United States, or who were convicted of crimes before their removal.

Rep. Brad Knott of North Carolina, a Republican and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in floor remarks that the legislation “profoundly enables law enforcement to protect us” from crimes perpetuated by those who enter the United States illegally.

“No matter the type or category, all crime is made worse by illegal immigration,” Knott said. “Theft, assault, murder, drug trafficking, human trafficking, violent crime, property crime, you name it. Illegal immigration makes it worse. What is perhaps most unfortunate is that many of the worst offenders in this specific category return to the United States after being deported due to gaps in the current immigration law.”

Knott, a former prosecutor, said he saw in that role that the deportation process alone was insufficient to stop migrants who seek to come into the United States for illegal purposes.

“I have investigated, tried and convicted many individuals who have been deported two times, three times, four times, and some even beyond 10 times, yet they continue to illegally return with the sole intent,” Knott said.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-vote majority but need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster on legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has introduced a companion bill, also known as Kate’s Law.

And these guys are here (National Guardsmen), willingly or not, defending it.”

According to Harmon, he was arrested for failing to comply with an order; an agent told him to move from a bollard on the sidewalk and he refused, remarking that it was a public sidewalk. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Response Unit responded by swarming Harmon, firing less-lethal rounds into the crowd as he fled.

The sound of projectile launchers and federal agents yelling conflicting orders disoriented the space. Protesters ran as rubber bullets flew by and pelted people on the head.

Kea Lane, who claims ICE is “kidnapping and disappearing” her community members, said this occurrence is common. Lane is an activist who routinely attends the 24-hour protest at the detention center.

“They target specific protesters they deem to be threats, regardless of what they’ve done. They make untruthful claims and charges against people,” Lane said.

Since June, DHS — with National Guardsmen on standby — has skirmished almost nightly with protesters outside the detention center, a migrant-holding facility, in response to mass deportation efforts in Los Angeles County.

In response, some protesters started Occupy ICE LA, a 24-hour protest collective set up across the street from the detention center, which documents and accosts DHS agents throughout the day.

Protesters haven’t left the encampment in weeks despite almost nightly skirmishes with DHS and multiple removals by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).

According to LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, the LAPD doesn’t assist with immigration enforcement and hasn’t since 1979. In a June press statement, McDonnell reiterated the policy to “make it clear.”

Since then, the LAPD has regularly dispersed anti-ICE protests, including at ICE immigration raids. DHS started mass deportations sweeps in Los Angeles County by arresting 44 migrants on June 6; this was followed by additional raids targeting farm workers, day laborers and street vendors. ICE is also appearing at schools, churches, and mandated immigration check-ins at federal facilities.

Occupy ICE LA held a sit-in at City Hall at 4 p.m. before marching through downtown. Activists delivered speeches on the lawn regarding ICE, the Palestinian genocide in Gaza by Israel, as per the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the struggle of Indigenous people.

According to Trisden Shaw, a professor of ethnic studies at Santa Monica College, these topics are interlinked through colonialism. Shaw said the U.S. dominates the world through colonization, which is why the country is militarily involved in different places.

On the South Lawn, an activist who has been involved in the Abolish ICE movement since 2018 said during a speech, “I have never seen the amount of aggression that I’ve seen at these protests.” He called them “mercenaries” and demanded ICE to “get the fuck out of L.A.,” before telling the crowd they should be concerned.

“Even if you’re not directly affected by it, it is your problem. It’s your issue because this is more than just an immigration issue; this is a human rights issue,” he said. “People’s human rights are being violated left and right.” This protester was later arrested.

After the speeches, protesters spilled onto west First Street in front of the LAPD Headquarters. Protesters displayed their signs, waved flags and danced alongside the road.

People on motorcycles dashed around the street, performing burnouts and wheelies to a crowd of cheering protesters. Incoming traffic honked and drivers raised fists in solidarity as they drove by. Protesters chanted and marched towards the detention center around 7 p.m.

A few people banged, kicked, and rattled the newly installed black, metal, anti-climb fence at the detention center, but most just shouted from the street. One protester shot a firework, while another kicked the gate until it opened. People cheered and mocked as DHS approached, but most maintained their distance, and no one stepped onto federal property.

According to Shaw, “a peaceful protest can be deemed violent very quickly. Repressive and violent actions from police could spiral out of control quickly. Organizers have to ensure that people aren’t reacting, but human beings are human beings. One action is enough to deem it a violent protest; when that label comes, it opens the floodgates for tear gas, rubber bullets.”

A man holding a Mexican American flag helped close the gate. Then, a DHS agent fired a pepper ball, a hard plastic sphere filled with a chemical irritant that bursts on impact, into the fence, covering protesters in irritant.

Protesters fled, seeking cover, but they returned to the gate, yelling “peaceful protest.”

After a DHS agent fired a pepper ball, two protesters jumped on the fence, catching agents’ attention, and raised their middle fingers in opposition before spray-painting “Fuck ICE” under fire. Protesters threw water bottles from the crowd as pepper bullets exploded off the fence, with some pepper balls making it through and hitting non-protester cars idling in traffic.

DHS and ICE’s Special Response Team then moved onto the sidewalk to commence dispersal tactics on the other side of the fence. Most protesters retreated and journalists wearing “PRESS” markings moved forward, waiting for action. Before coming out, one federal agent stuck his arm out of the gate and pepper-sprayed the vicinity, including identifiable journalists.

Protesters threw stink bombs at the agents’ feet as they exploded out of the gate, ambushing people and shooting less-lethal rounds into the crowd.

“They were shooting at innocent protesters, innocent civilians, who came up to document them violently detaining and snatching people off the street,” Lane said. “This should be far past the point of alarming.”

Protesters managed to lift a fence panel off its hinges and lay it on the floor during a skirmish. A person with a megaphone then jumped on top of the panel and said, “Look at this shit, they couldn’t even get a better fucking fence.”

DHS and protesters skirmished for hours. Agents would explode out of the gate and swarm the crowd, tackling people and creating mass panic before retreating. Women with megaphones walked up to the DHS skirmish line and called agents “cowards,” “slave catchers,” and “human traffickers.”

LAPD arrived before 10 p.m. and declared an unlawful assembly. Officers set a perimeter on the intersection of North Alameda and East Aliso Street, then formed a rolling police line, carrying plastic handcuffs and 40-millimeter sponge round launchers. They pushed protesters towards East Temple Street, away from the detention center, shouting “move,” as they stepped in unison.

Protesters yelled, “You’re not supposed to be helping them,” “The bad guys are behind you,” and “Why don’t you care about them shooting us?”

LAPD officers shouted at protesters and threatened to arrest journalists for not complying with the dispersal order, despite a still-standing temporary restraining order (TRO) granting increased protections to journalists.

According to federal U.S. District Judge Hernan Vera’s order, “the likelihood of repeated confrontations” coupled with the LAPD’s “sustained pattern of conduct,” merited the TRO. LAPD can’t restrict journalists’ movement, shoot them with less-lethal weapons or obstruct, assault or arrest journalists during protests.

William Gude, known online as Film the Police LA, recorded an LAPD sergeant disregarding the TRO. Gude later identified the sergeant as Jose L. Vazquez from the Hollenbeck Division after he refused to identify himself and didn’t have it displayed on his helmet.

Gude reminded Vazquez of the court exemptions for journalists. Vazquez said, “It doesn’t matter right now,” and threatened to arrest Gude.

The confrontation caught the attention of an LAPD captain, who corrected Vazquez after he refused to let Gude talk to a superior officer.

“You’re absolutely right,” the captain said to Gude. Vazquez protested before waving off the captain and walking away.

Most protesters left around 10 p.m., but some people stayed across the street. Both parties stood still, facing off on different street corners. And in quick, random bursts, a dozen officers sprinted across the corner and arrested people.

In one instance, police chased a man who evaded them. While returning, an officer found an older woman huddled in a dark alleyway. Officers swarmed and arrested her. They later arrested another protester who smiled and laughed as LAPD officers escorted him away.

According to the LAPD’s Central Division X account, the LAPD arrested eight people for “various offenses,” and no one was injured during the unlawful assembly. LAPD and the officials at the detention center declined the Corsair’s request for comment.

The freedom of protest is the right to assembly and petition. These are guaranteed protections under the First Amendment in the United States, but it “Doesn’t always play out that way,” according to Shaw. Sometimes protesters don’t get what they want.

As of August 2025, ICE Flight Monitor is officially housed at HRF.","Washington, D.C. — A new report released today by ICE Flight Monitor, housed at Human Rights First, reveals that August 2025 marked a record-high number of U.S. immigration enforcement flights, underscoring the unprecedented scale and intensity of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.

The latest report documents at least 1,393 immigration enforcement flights in August alone—an average of 45 flights every day—the highest monthly total ever recorded since tracking began in 2020. In total, between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the administration carried out at least 7,454 flights, a 34 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.

“These numbers are absolutely staggering and deeply concerning in light of their connection to the increased arrests, detentions, and removals of people in our communities,” said Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First. “Behind every flight are families torn apart, people disappeared without due process, and human rights violated on an industrial scale. The Trump administration’s deportation campaign is unprecedented in scope and cruelty and is a clear attack on due process, the rule of law, and overall transparency of our immigration system.”

Human Rights First President and CEO Uzra Zeya added, “In the face of escalating harms perpetrated against immigrants throughout the United States, ICE Flight Monitor is an essential tool for transparency and holding our government to account. U.S. democracy is strengthened when Americans know where their tax dollars are going – in this case, a mushrooming deportation machine fueled by an unprecedented $170 billion cash infusion to DHS and its components. We need Congress and the courts to rein in this anti-democratic enforcement overreach.”

Additional key findings in the August report, include:

Increase in Removal Flights: At least 240 removal flights took place in August 2025, driven largely by an increase in flights to Mexico. The Trump administration has now carried out at least 1,279 removal flights since returning to office—20 percent more than during the same period last year.

New Destinations and Increased Multi-Country Flights: The Trump administration has sent removal flights to at least 66 countries, including first-time flights to Greece, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. It also expanded multi-country flights, where people remain shackled for days across multiple stops.

Third Country Transfers: In August, ICE Flight Monitor tracked the first deportation flight to Rwanda under a newly established U.S.–Rwanda agreement, part of a broader expansion of third-country removals.

Increased Domestic Transfer Flights: The administration conducted at least 805 domestic detention transfer flights in August 2025 alone, including 81 flights to offshore detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, where individuals are held in isolated detention facilities on the military base.

The report warns that these practices, many of which federal courts have already deemed unlawful, not only endanger vulnerable people but also erode democratic accountability.

(AP) — Immigrant detainees have started arriving at a former Tennessee prison that’s been turned into a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, the facility’s operator said.

CoreCivic Inc. said late Wednesday that it has begun receiving detainees at the West Tennessee Detention Facility in the rural town of Mason, located about 40 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Memphis.

The arrivals come after Mason officials approved agreements with ICE and CoreCivic on Aug. 12, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.

For years, the prison served as an important economic engine for Mason. It was closed in 2021 after President Joe Biden ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to stop renewing contracts with certain detention facilities. President Donald Trump reversed that order in January.

The contracts were approved amid a push by Trump for mass deportations of immigrants. Trump has touted a detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where allegations of mistreatment of detainees have drawn lawsuits from civil rights advocates and environmental groups.

Opponents of the Tennessee detention center, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, have expressed concerns that detainees could be subjected to abuse and neglect.

Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman has said the ICE facility will bring jobs and economic development to the town, which has struggled with financial problems and needs infrastructure improvements.

The ICE facility is expected to create nearly 240 new jobs, including positions for detention officers at a pay rate of $26.50 per hour, according to CoreCivic. The facility would also generate about $325,000 in annual property tax revenue and $200,000 in an annual fee for Mason that could be used for schools, infrastructure improvements and other projects, the company has said.

In 2022, Mason reached a deal with the state of Tennessee after it attempted to take over the city’s finances following years of alleged mismanagement. Some members of the public who spoke at the August meeting said Mason is a majority-Black town with a history of being ignored and treated with disrespect.

Tennessee’s corrections agency has fined CoreCivic $44.7 million across four prisons for violations from 2022 through February, including for understaffing. Records obtained by AP also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment — including at least 22 inmate deaths — at four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024.

The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge’s finding that National Guard members were illegally used for civilian law enforcement.","Three months after the Trump administration first sent troops to Los Angeles, a federal judge ruled that their National Guard deployment was illegal. As President Trump considers extending the federal takeover of Washington D.C. and ordering troops to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, LA residents are still recovering from the public safety, economic, and social impacts of this deployment – illustrating what may be in store for other major U.S. cities soon.

Why did Trump send troops to LA?

This spring, federal immigration enforcement in the LA region skyrocketed, with immigration arrests quadrupling between April and June. Immigrants without criminal convictions made up an increasing share of monthly arrests, jumping from 35 to 69% and challenging the Trump administration’s claims of targeting criminals for deportation. Evidence of racial profiling by federal immigration officers in LA initially resulted in a court order barring them from stopping someone based solely on race, language, job, or location, which the U.S. Supreme Court later overruled.

In early June, protests emerged in pockets of LA, following weeks of escalating immigration raids across the city, reports of inhumane detention conditions, and racial profiling concerns. Local officials, responding to isolated clashes between local law enforcement and some protestors, issued overnight curfews in downtown LA as they worked to lower tensions. Over objections from local and state leaders, President Trump then deployed 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA, ostensibly to protect federal personnel and property from protestors.

How did troops impact public safety?

By August, the Trump administration removed all but 250 troops from LA, claiming victory and restored public safety. The operation resulted in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charging just 26 individuals for crimes relating to protests over immigration raids. Notably, DOJ prosecutors dismissed eight of these charges shortly after filing, five because of false statements made by U.S. immigration officials. As the dust settles, it’s also clearer how this deployment posed its own threats to public safety, both during the protests and beyond.

From the start, state and local officials in California pushed back against the deployment as unnecessary and inflammatory. Even at the height of the protests, LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell insisted that, “We’re nowhere near a level where we would be reaching out to the governor for the National Guard.”

It marked the first time since the 1960s that the National Guard was deployed without a governor’s consent. Governor Gavin Newsom later sued the Trump administration, claiming in separate filings that the deployment unlawfully bypassed the governor’s permission and violated federal law by using troops for civilian law enforcement. Critics of the deployment emphasized it undermined public safety by escalating local tensions, diverting National Guard resources from critical work, including counterdrug operations, intimidating communities, and eroding public trust in the U.S. military.

Records disclosed in court unveiled that U.S. military leaders shared major concerns about this deployment and questioned whether troops were adequately trained for a domestic operation. They noted the operation could spur new protests, posing a significant risk to both LA residents and troops. National Guard members themselves also voiced concerns about being sent to LA with reports of decreased troop morale, amid a lack of work to do, and concerns over how the deployment could hurt military recruitment efforts for the next several years.

Who bears the costs of this deployment?

The U.S. Department of Defense initially estimated that the deployments would cost U.S. taxpayers at least $134 million. The operation’s exact costs remain undisclosed, with requests pending from California’s U.S. senators and governor to the federal government to get a more accurate picture of official expenses. In the meantime, Governor Newson’s office produced their own estimates, reporting $120 million in deployment costs so far.

This price tag for American taxpayers, however, is only a fraction of the full costs of the deployment.

In California, residents shoulder additional economic and social impacts, between the increase in immigration enforcement actions and the military deployment. Small businesses throughout LA are hurting from steep declines in foot traffic and sales. Employees weigh the risks of showing up to work, student attendance is in decline, and healthcare visits by immigrant patients have dropped off. The vibrancy of the city has become duller this summer, as communities are gripped by fear.

What comes next?

From the original 4,100 troops, now 250 National Guard troops remain in LA as the state’s lawsuit against the deployment continues. The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge’s finding that National Guard members were illegally used for civilian law enforcement. Locally, LA city and county officials are launching funds to help communities rebuild from raids and city leaders have established new school protection measures for immigrant families.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shutterstock_2640406581.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 13:57:22.840841

Harrison ran again in 2022 and notably campaigned on the promise of not rejoining the 287(g) agreement.","On Sept. 8, the Supreme Court stayed a district court injunction that had found Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents violated the Fourth Amendment by relying solely on an individual’s race and ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, location (such as a car wash or bus stop), and type of work as grounds for immigration arrests. The reversal permits ICE agents, at least in Los Angeles, to treat these factors as sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion of unlawful status.

In the sole concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh characterized the encounters with ICE as “brief investigative stops” during which agents “promptly let the individual go” if they learn that the individual being questioned is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the country. This account is inconsistent with the increasing incidents of ICE agents violently detaining and arresting U.S. citizens, at times resulting in their wrongful detention for weeks. And while Kavanaugh’s opinion suggests that remedies remain available for any Fourth Amendment violations that occur during these raids, in practice, ICE agents and the agencies that oversee them remain largely insulated from legal accountability.

Federal agents, however, are not operating alone. While ICE is bolstering its reach with a recently expanded budget, it still lacks the capacity to achieve Trump’s goal of 1,000,000 ICE deportations in his first year. Given this, the administration has enlisted the help of sheriffs across the country by reimplementing the 287(g) Task Force Model (TFM) program—which authorizes local law enforcement officers to function as federal immigration agents—for the first time since it was disbanded for violation of civil rights in 2012.

Unlike ICE, these local agencies are not immune from liability. The return of the 287(g) TFM opens a critical legal avenue for civil suits against sheriffs and municipalities whose officers violate the law, serving as a method of recourse for individuals and a necessary check against potential overreach by the Trump administration.

The 287(g) Program

The 287(g) program was created in 1996 through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA), an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It was designed to provide ICE with a “force multiplier” by permitting state and local police to assist in immigration enforcement. More specifically, it allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into formal agreements with state and local agencies, which deputize officers to carry out certain immigration enforcement functions, including interrogating individuals about their immigration status, issuing detainers, and initiating removal proceedings.

Initially, the program operated through three models: the Jail Enforcement Model (JEM), the Task Force Model (TFM), and the Hybrid Model (HM). The JEM permits law enforcement to interrogate and assist in the removal of noncitizens already in federal custody. The TFM, in turn, allows officers to proactively identify, question, detain, and arrest individuals based on suspected immigration violations during patrols in the community. And the HM gave officers the authority to perform immigration enforcement duties under the JEM and TFM. The government terminated the TFM in 2012 for civil rights violations but continued the JEM. The fundamental civil rights issue with the TFM is its structure: Officers are instructed to seek out noncitizens, but unlike criminal behavior, immigration status is not readily observable. Without clear markers of legal status, race can easily act as a proxy for suspicion of legal status. Officers who carry out the TFM, like all other officers, cannot use race as the sole factor to stop and question an individual. They are bound by federal, state, and local laws that stipulate that “reasonable suspicion,” required for detainment, cannot be built solely on race.

Later, in 2019, the government introduced the new Warrant Service Officer Model (WSOM), which allows local officers to execute ICE immigration warrants on already incarcerated individuals. Despite civil rights concerns, days after beginning his second term, President Trump reinstated the TFM in its original form, reigniting civil rights concerns that led to its previous termination. Unlike the other 287(g) models, the TFM allows local officers to initiate immigration enforcement during routine patrols, absent an ICE warrant or underlying criminal custody. This degree of discretion heightens the potential for racial profiling and other forms of unlawful detainment or imprisonment.

A History of the Program’s Civil Rights Violations

Various Department of Justice investigations have documented patterns of civil rights abuse by sheriff’s offices that implemented the TFM. For example, a 2011 Justice Department investigation concluded that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona “engaged in a pattern or practice of misconduct that violated the Constitution and federal law” in its execution of the 287(g) task force. This included sending dozens of officers to predominantly Latino neighborhoods to make minor traffic stops with the ultimate goal of questioning individuals’ legal status and turning them over to ICE (resulting in a 9-to-1 racial disparity in traffic stops). In a separate 2012 investigation, the Justice Department found similar violations in Alamance County, North Carolina. There, investigators determined that sheriff’s deputies were instructed to “go hunting” for Latino individuals and to set up checkpoints in front of Latino churches and businesses. As a result of these findings, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) agreements with both counties.

Oversight Challenges

The risk of civil rights violations is compounded by the lack of proper training and oversight, as documented by governmental oversight agencies. A 2009 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report criticized ICE for failing to articulate goals for the program and how local partners were to use their 287(g) authority. Deputized officers did not receive adequate training, and ICE failed to evaluate whether participating agencies complied with the agreements.

A 2010 report from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that ICE and its local law enforcement partners had not complied with the terms of their 287(g) agreements. It determined that the standards by which deputized officers were assessed contradicted the stated objectives of the 287(g) program, that the program was poorly supervised by ICE, and that additional oversight was necessary.

Following the 2009 GAO report, the Department of Homeland Security established an advisory board to evaluate agency applicants and vote on whether they should be accepted. This board included a representative from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties who monitored and advised agencies’ histories of civil rights abuses, acting as a safeguard against partnerships with those that had poor records. President Trump dissolved this board in early 2025, clearing the path for all law enforcement agencies, regardless of patterns of misconduct, to enter into an agreement.

Even as the TFM remained inactive for over a decade, the JEM and WSOM continued to suffer from inadequate oversight. A 2018 OIG report found that ICE was not ensuring that deputized officers completed required training. A 2021 GAO report found that ICE had failed to establish performance goals for the JEM and WSO 287(g) program. As of June 2025, ICE has not taken actions necessary to satisfy the recommendations from GAO, raising red flags about its ability to manage a more expansive, field-based enforcement model such as the TFM.

Additionally, while deputized TFM officers are currently required to undergo four weeks of training before going out into the field, “border czar” Tom Homan announced in February that he intends to cut the training period down to about one week.

Recourse Under 287(g) Task Force

Typically, there is little or no recourse for individuals whose rights are violated by immigration officials. Patrolling for illegal immigrants has historically been carried out by federal officers, including ICE. The Supreme Court, in its 1971 Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents decision, recognized an implied cause of action against federal officers for damages arising from the Constitution, terming it a “Bivens action.” In 1980, the Court stopped extending the theory to new factual scenarios, and since 1983, the Court has retreated from the theory altogether. In 2017, the Court narrowed the scope of Bivens claims to cases that have the same facts as prior cases and that do not involve any special factors that were not present in those prior cases. In the 2022 case Egbert v. Boule, the Court collapsed this new test into one question: “whether there is any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy.” As a result, under current law, individuals who violate constitutional rights while acting under federal authority are effectively immune from civil liability.

The reimplementation of the 287(g) TFM may open the gates to new remedies against illegal immigration enforcement actions. While the individual deputized officers are “considered to be acting under color of federal authority for purposes of determining the liability, and immunity from suit,” the local agencies and municipalities that oversee deputized officers are not afforded the same protections. By entering these agreements, sheriffs, counties, and municipalities may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a federal statute that allows individuals to sue state and local officials for constitutional violations, when the plaintiffs’ injuries stem from policies or customs of the law enforcement agency. They may also face liability under state tort law. Many states have tort frameworks that mirror § 1983, allowing broad liability for agencies or municipalities. Some state constitutions protect rights beyond those recognized by the U.S. Constitution, thereby expanding the scope of actionable claims. For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2020 that the state constitution requires a warrant for persistent surveillance outside a home using a pole camera, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has found such surveillance permissible under the federal Constitution. Additionally, in 2017, the Iowa State Supreme Court ruled that an officer must terminate a valid traffic stop when the underlying suspicion is no longer present, and cannot go on to demand identification. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has determined that officers can check identification even when the suspicion for the stop has dissipated so long as it does not measurably extend the stop’s duration.

The legality of suing local agencies and municipalities for TFM actions is evidenced by the litigation against the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, which ultimately cost the county over $300 million in settlements. Even the more restrained JEM and WSOM have produced costly lawsuits for municipalities and sheriff’s departments. Those that have paid plaintiffs for civil rights abuses in the past several years include the Monroe County sheriff, El Paso County, San Juan County, Los Angeles County, Plymouth County, Henrico County, Nobles County, Allegheny County, Lehigh County, Bexar County, and Arapahoe County. This year, a federal judge ruled that Suffolk County could be held liable for up to $60 million in damages for officers’ execution of unlawful immigration detainers, and another judge found that Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay violated a U.S. citizen’s rights by holding him on an ICE detainer.

Lawsuits can act as a deterrent to police departments’ participation in the 287(g) TFM through two primary and interrelated mechanisms: financial consequences and public pressure. Police agencies generally have the choice to enter into these agreements, and when the cost is too high, they may choose to opt out entirely or adopt stricter policies and training to ensure that their officers will not violate constitutional norms.

Municipalities nationwide generally purchase insurance to indemnify themselves against liability for the acts of their law enforcement officers. These insurance policies shield them from financial responsibility in civil lawsuits. Because insurers control both the availability and the cost of coverage, they hold significant influence over police department practices. Insurance companies frequently leverage this power by requiring policy or procedural changes when they identify patterns of risk. Following high numbers of civil rights lawsuits, insurers typically raise their rates, demand changes in law enforcement personnel and policies as a condition of continued coverage, and, in some cases, remove coverage altogether. If the TFM model produces a surge in lawsuits, insurers are likely to respond with a demand in policy shift, induce higher rates, or reduce coverage, all of which may prompt agencies to reconsider their participation in the program.

Publicized incidents of civil rights violations have led to political pressure prompting sheriffs to leave the 287(g) agreement or be ousted at the ballot box. For example, Plymouth County (Massachusetts) Sheriff Joseph McDonald chose not to renew his office’s 287(g) agreement in 2020 following a suit from a coalition of civil rights groups. Donnie Harrison—who served as the sheriff for Wake County, North Carolina, from 2002 to2018, and first implemented the 287(g) program in 2007—lost his 2018 bid for reelection after his support for the WSOM and JEM became a focal point of the race. Harrison ran again in 2022 and notably campaigned on the promise of not rejoining the 287(g) agreement. What’s more, Joe Arpaio was Maricopa County’s longest serving sheriff. He was ousted in 2016 by a Democratic challenger following the numerous lawsuits against the department for violations of civil rights in its implementation of the 287(g) program, both when it had 287(g) authority and after Homeland Security ended their agreement. The following year, Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for violating a federal judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos in traffic stops while he was sheriff.

When the TFM was first suspended in 2012, only 27 law enforcement agencies had active agreements with Homeland Security. As of July, that number has increased to an unprecedented 473 with an additional 12 pending agreements. To meet President Trump’s ambitious deportation goals, even more local agencies will likely need to join.

While the reinstatement and expansion of the program, with its history of abuse and minimal oversight, raises the danger of widespread rights violations, it also provides a novel avenue for accountability. Pursuing civil lawsuits against rights violations by local law enforcement will act as a safeguard against unlawful immigration enforcement practices and ensure the protection of civil liberties.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-11 14:57:10.262674

In July, Attorney General Ellison joined 20 other attorneys general in challenging the federal government’s reinterpretation of a decades-old law governing access to social services. A federal court granted the coalition’s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking sweeping new rules that threatened to strip funding from programs like Head Start, Title X family planning clinics, food banks, domestic violence shelters, adult education, and community health centers.

""Cutting off essential social services to people who cannot prove their immigration status is cruel and would have caused immense harm to folks across Minnesota, including kids from low-income families,” said Attorney General Ellison. “It is morally wrong to turn a child away from a food bank because of their family’s immigration status, and I’m pleased to have stopped the Trump Administration from doing exactly that. I don’t believe in the politics of division and cruelty, and most Minnesotans don’t either. We’re a state that believes in helping one another and treating others with respect, and that’s exactly what I will continue fighting for as your attorney general.”

Earlier this summer, four federal agencies – the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (ED), Labor (DOL), and Justice (DOJ) – issued a coordinated set of directives abruptly redefining longstanding policy under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). For nearly 30 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike interpreted PRWORA to allow states to offer vital public health, education, and anti-poverty programs regardless of immigration status. The Trump administration’s sudden reversal would have forced states to impose immigration status verification on countless services, threatening catastrophic funding losses and program closures.

The court’s decision halts implementation of those new directives in the plaintiff states while litigation proceeds, ensuring that millions of families can continue to access critical services without fear of denial or disruption. With this ruling, the judge is acknowledging that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by issuing sweeping new mandates without lawful rulemaking, grossly misreading PRWORA, and failing to consider the devastating impacts on states and communities.

In Minnesota, the changes to social services were expected to affect a variety of programs. One of the most prominent is Head Start, an early education program for low-income families that provides comprehensive services ranging from school readiness to parental engagement to nutrition and more. Another of the programs expected to be targeted funds the operation of shelters for homeless individuals, provides services for residents of those shelters, rapidly re-houses families to prevent them from becoming homeless, and more. Delivery time for some of these services, like emergency shelter during life-threatening weather conditions, can make the difference between life and death. Delaying these services to verify immigration status could have a devastating impact on recipients. Furthermore, given the transient nature of homelessness, many of the individuals served by this particular program do not have documentation of any kind.

I’m grateful to those of you who are already paid subscribers, and I hope that those of you who aren’t will consider a paid subscription if and when your circumstances permit:

The Court has already made a lot of news this week, but Justice Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Monday’s otherwise-unexplained stay in the ICE roving patrols case (Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo) is a truly remarkable writing in any number of respects. And although I feel a little bad for devoting yet another issue of the newsletter specifically to Kavanaugh, he is, to his genuine credit, the only justice in the majority who seems interested in publicly defending the Court’s (or, at least, his) behavior in these cases. That is a good thing, and I’ve devoted plenty of (virtual) ink to why the other justices need to be writing. But it should follow that the writings ought to be at least somewhat persuasive. Whatever Justice Kavanaugh was trying to accomplish here, it’s hard to conclude anything other than that it fails.

Below the fold, I walk through Kavanaugh’s concurrence one argument at a time—in an effort to show exactly how he ends up in such a radically different place from both the district court and the unanimous court of appeals panel, albeit without making any effort to explain why those four judges were (all) wrong. Some of it is because of slipperiness with the facts; some of it is because of slipperiness with the relevant precedents. Some of it is because Kavanaugh seems to think things are true doctrinally that (in some cases, thanks to him), just aren’t. But what it all drives home is how much the justices in the majority in these cases seem to be twisting themselves—to say nothing of the facts and/or the law—into pretzels in order to rule for the Trump administration.

To be sure, there are far more overt ways in which the justices have shown disrespect toward lower courts in their recent spate of rulings on Trump-related emergency applications. But just because this one is more subtle doesn’t make it any less serious—or any more defensible.

California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision Wednesday by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling Wednesday, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s Office. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” she said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of Wednesday’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

In a new twist, on September 5, 2025, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that DHS' revocation of the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation, and a partial revocation of a TPS designation for Haiti, violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Venezuelan and Haitian TPS beneficiaries cannot celebrate yet, however. DHS immediately moved for a stay pending appeal, which the district court has not decided.

President Trump on Tuesday appeared to backtrack on sending in troops to Chicago.

""We're going to be announcing another city that we're going to very shortly,"" he said after dining at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. ""We're working it out with the governor of a certain state that would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city in that same state would love us to be there. We'll announce it probably tomorrow, and it's going to be something where we'll do like we did here.""

The federal government's 30-day takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., expires Wednesday, although the D.C. National Guard will remain posted throughout the district.

With the president suggesting another city could see a National Guard instead, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's sources inside the White House have signaled Chicago might no longer be the primary focus of the Trump administration's National Guard effort.

""They're not calling us now, which I think is a good sign. It is a sign that they are not hearing things that are suspiciously like we're going to see military troops coming,"" Pritzker said. ""I take it that the silence of the last day or two from those folks is an indication that maybe there's some other place or other focus that the president is putting his attention.""

Pritzker said it's a good sign a troop deployment isn't imminent in Chicago, but stressed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts in Chicago are just getting started, with agents netting more than a dozen arrests in recent days.

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security touted the arrests of 13 people as part of ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

""In just the last few days in Chicago, ICE has arrested pedophiles, rapists, abusers, armed robbers, and other violent thugs,"" Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the federal government still has not provided any official communication with the city on their immigration crackdown in Chicago.

""Nothing has been communicated with us, and that's what the problem has been,"" he said.

Johnson said the rollout of a new website will be coming soon to help anyone in Chicago feeling under pressure by ICE raids.

In Pilsen, box trucks have been spotted with large video boards displaying scrolling ""know your rights"" messages to equip residents with information in case ICE knocks on their door.

Illinois leaders said they're hopeful the president's threatened National Guard rollout has been delayed or canceled, while reiterating the ICE efforts are just getting going.

""They clearly have not gone out in full force yet here, with seemingly the number of people from ICE that they intended to have on the ground working. We haven't seen all of those folks yet, but I anticipate that we will,"" Pritzker said.

Pritzker said, to his knowledge, approximately 200 ICE agents and 100 ICE vehicles have been deployed in and around Chicago in recent days.

As for Chicago apparently being put on the back burner of the president's National Guard deployments, Pritzker said it's good news, but he's not convinced the White House won't send troops in eventually.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/02/f97644f1-61b3-411f-a684-6449800ecdd7/thumbnail/1200x630/9412dfb1290062610b8bbb7a066d3236/cbsn-fusion-judge-says-trump-administration-violated-federal-law-with-la-national-guard-deployment-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:57:38.095885

As President Trump’s immigration crackdown intensifies, many immigrants who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for years are getting snatched by masked agents and disappeared into a vast network of jails across the country.

In Vermont, a small but growing group of young attorneys have thrown themselves into the fight to defend the immigrants’ rights. Newly minted lawyers, including recent graduates of Vermont Law and Graduate School, are now going head to head with lawyers from Trump’s Justice Department.

The attorneys have been going into Vermont’s jails and encountering terrified immigrants, many of whom are being repeatedly shuffled between states in what appears to be a deliberate effort to frustrate their attempts to obtain effective legal representation. Some detainees do not even know where they are.

Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP), headed by immigration attorney Jill Martin Diaz, has been a driving force behind the effort to mobilize lawyers and defend immigrants. VAAP has grown from one staff member in 2024 to what will be a staff of eight by November, including four new attorneys who are part of the national Immigrant Justice Corps. VAAP recently received a $100,000 grant from the recently established Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to hire staff, bring in attorneys and train Vermont lawyers to handle immigration cases.

Martin Diaz formerly taught immigration law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, directed its Center for Justice Reform Clinic and practiced at Vermont Legal Aid. They currently are a lecturer in the department of social work at the University of Vermont. In 2023, Martin Diaz was named by the LGBTQ+ Bar Association as one of the 40 best LGBTQ+ lawyers under 40.

I visited VAAP’s headquarters in Burlington, where I interviewed Martin Diaz, staff attorney Leah Brenner and volunteer staff attorney Andy Pelcher.

“I’m looking around at our office that’s not even unpacked and we barely have lights and WiFi. How are we holding our own against Trump’s Department of Justice that just got a big, beautiful raise?” marveled Martin Diaz, who described fighting the Trump administration as akin to David vs. Goliath.

Martin Diaz said that immigrants are “canaries in the coal mine.”

“People are really starting to look at what’s going on in the immigration system as a microcosm for what could happen to our democracy if left unchecked, not just for noncitizens, but for everyone.”

Pelcher, who graduated Vermont Law and Graduate School in 2018 and went on to get an LLM, or master of laws, described a recent visit to Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, where he encountered a Palestinian man who was a survivor of torture who “had been bounced around to a number of facilities during the 14 months that he had been detained.” Somehow he landed in a Vermont jail.

“People are being frequently transferred from facility to facility, seemingly as a means to deny access to counsel, family, local networks of support, and any other means by which these individuals can meaningfully prepare for their defense against removal,” said Pelcher. VAAP, together with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, took on the man’s case.

VAAP’s experience finding and aiding immigrants in Vermont’s jails has led Martin Diaz to oppose the idea of closing Vermont’s jails to ICE. “I would not advocate for more beds, but I would also strongly caution against a wholesale end to ICE’s ability to detain people in our state,” they said. “The truth is that there is no substitute for lawyers getting in their cars, going to a facility with our bodies and meeting one on one in private with our clients directly.”

“It’s really, really difficult to provide people with legal help telephonically, when the people who have your clients in custody have no respect for the rule of law and for individuals rights.”

Is America’s legal system up to the task of defending rights and institutions in the Trump era?

“I do have hope that the rule of law will prevail and that this horrible, horrible, tragic moment in our history, this painful moment for our community members who are being directly impacted, can also be a galvanizing opportunity for us to rethink what do we want our laws to say? What do we want due process to look like? What checks and balances do we want?” said Martin Diaz.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jill-martin-diaz-3-20250827.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:57:16.027806

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s Office. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” she said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

Cell phone video obtained by News 8 Wednesday shows Maria Garcia, program director of the Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies, questioning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents about whether they had a warrant.

“I need a warrant for the property, the business or them,” Garcia is heard telling an agent. “Which one do you have?”

Garcia said she was permitted to climb to the roof where the workers had taken refuge. She had them sign legal representation forms, allowing her to communicate with federal agents on their behalf. Garcia noted the men, who were hired for a contracted job at the home, did not speak English but were able to communicate with her in Spanish.

She told News 8 that her focus was on the workers’ safety, with the men perched on the roof while tensions grew below.

“The purpose of us being there was for these workers,” Garcia said. “If everyone downstairs is panicking, they see people panicking … there was no one to catch them, there was no safety plan for them.”

As protesters gathered nearby with signs reading “Keep ICE out of Rochester,” Garcia said she worked to steer the crowd away from direct confrontation with law enforcement.

At one point, a Border Patrol van was seen with flat tires. It remains unclear how the damage occurred, but agents were later observed leaving in the vehicle.

Garcia said vandalism complicated the situation.

“It did also make things worse for us,” she said. “What could have ended quicker and a lot more efficient kind of just backlogged a bit.”

The Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies confirmed that one person was detained in connection with the incident.

In a statement, Monroe County Republican Committee Chairman Patrick Reilly criticized local officials’ response, describing it as “Democratic officials cheering on vandalism and bullying of law enforcement,” calling it “completely disgusting.”

Immigration law is recognized as being the second-most-complex area of law in the country, second maybe to tax law.
So they’re not even going to be there long enough to have the normal immigration judge training applied to them.","What is happening is that established law is being disregarded, if not outright violated at an astonishing pace.

[During my tenure], ICE was extremely rarely allowed to make arrests in the courthouse because of the chilling effect it would have on people appearing in court. Or the chilling effect it would have on their ability to obtain witnesses that they might need and have their witnesses come forward and testify.

What about this tactic employed by the Department of Homeland Security in which it requests the dismissal of a case, then ICE immediately detains that person? Seems counterintuitive.

In the old days, if DHS wanted the case dismissed, it was on the assumption that you were not an enforcement priority, and you would be fine. Now, they’re taking people into custody immediately, because they no longer have the protection that has traditionally been afforded to people who had ongoing proceedings before the court.

[The government] is trying to bypass the immigration court system and make it irrelevant by going through a process called expedited removal, which is conducted by DHS officials, not by immigration court judges.

For years, expedited removal proceedings only occurred when someone had been present in the United States for less than two years and was within 100 miles of the border. Now they’ve said it applies nationwide, and they’re putting the burden of showing you’ve been here for more than two years on applicants. Do you walk around with rental receipts for two years in your pocket in case you bump into ICE? No.

Having worked under the full Trump administration before, there were management decisions that I didn’t agree with, but I did not feel there was such a blatant disregard of the substantive law. Now I feel like there's no consideration given to the substantive law. At most, there’s very superficial lip service.

I imagine you’ve got strong feelings about the judge firings. You were head of the National Association of Immigration Judges union for 14 years. The DOJ has terminated a third of the judges at San Francisco Immigration Court – a lot of them were people you worked alongside. And across the country, dozens more have been fired. Many wonder how these firings can be legal.

It is a violation of law in most of the cases.

There’s a difference between [a judge] who is on probation — that means during their first two years. If you’re on probation, you are an at-will employee, so they can let you go because they don’t like the color of your tie that day.

But everyone else is supposed to be protected under the civil service laws and have an opportunity to go to the Merit Systems Protections Board and be fired only for cause.

[Many of the people] that are being fired are not on probation. They are not being afforded the traditional civil service protections, because the administration is taking the legal position that the president has sole unfettered authority over anyone employed in the executive branch.

This is unheard of in the 45 years that I’ve been an immigration attorney.

What I really don’t get is why the Trump administration is getting rid of judges when there’s a long backlog of cases. People are waiting years for their chance to see a judge and plead their case.

The reason the courts are so backlogged is because Congress and the Department of Justice ignored the need to hire more immigration judges for the past decade or more. For years they added money for enforcement and ignored the immigration courts.

That clogged the system, because we didn’t have enough judges — when it was obvious that the simple solution to the backlog is hiring enough people to decide those cases.

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to appoint hundreds of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges. What do you think of that plan? What’s the transition going to be like for those new judges?

It's very demeaning to the expertise of the current immigration judge corps. Immigration law is recognized as being the second-most-complex area of law in the country, second maybe to tax law.

So they’re proposing to take on judges who have absolutely no background in immigration law. They say they’re going to train them, but their term is only six months. Currently immigration judges are trained and mentored for a full year. So they’re not even going to be there long enough to have the normal immigration judge training applied to them.

Why should someone in this country who doesn’t have an immigrant in their life with an open asylum case care about what’s happening in immigration courts?

Number one, any time due process is diminished for anyone, that creates a risk for everyone. It starts setting a precedent where, as U.S. citizens, you would be the next step with having your due process rights encroached upon.

Number two, the immigration courts are the only face of the American justice system that most noncitizens face, because the majority are not criminals. So if they have to leave and go back to their home country, I want them to respect the American justice system and feel like they were treated fairly and not go back bitter and hating America, because who knows what will happen next if that’s the case? Are those people ripe to be radicalized as anti-Americans?

But there are very few American citizens who are not touched by this fairly directly. The only good thing about the harshness of what the Trump administration is doing is that people who otherwise had no reason to know anything about immigration laws are being outraged, as they have people in their orbit — be it coworkers or members of their church congregations or people who have helped them in constructing their garage or in weeding their garden. These normal people that they never bothered to find out about — those are the people who have no legal way to regularize their status. It’s heartbreaking.

Up until recently, it didn’t touch [the lives of citizens] directly, but Trump is making sure it affects everybody.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_c7rfhlguup4s7d04ilb72h467c/-C100.00%25x78.71%25%2C0.00%25%2C19.44%25-FWEBP,N,,2025-09-11 13:57:25.779410

Cook-Trump case is latest power struggle over independence of Federal Reserve The case could become a turning point for the 112-year-old Federal Reserve.
No president has sought to fire a Fed governor before.
Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal court has ruled that embattled Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook can remain in her position while she fights President Donald Trump’s efforts to fire her.

The ruling, which will almost certainly be appealed, is a blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to assert more control over the traditionally independent Fed, which sets short-term interest rates to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Congress has also sought to insulate the Fed from day-to-day politics.

Cook is a Georgia native and a Spelman College graduate.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb late Tuesday granted Cook’s request for a preliminary injunction blocking her firing while the dispute makes its way through the courts. Cobb ruled that Cook would likely prevail in the lawsuit she filed late last month to overturn her firing.

Atlanta condo at center of Trump’s attempted firing of Cook

Trump, a Republican, said he was firing Cook on Aug. 25 over allegations raised by one of his appointees that she committed mortgage fraud related to two properties she purchased in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta in 2021, before she joined the Fed. Cook is accused of saying the properties were “primary residences,” which could have resulted in lower down payments and mortgage rates than if either was designated a second home or investment property.

The White House insisted Trump had the right to fire Cook.

“President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said Wednesday in a statement. “This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump Administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed.”

But Cobb ruled that the allegations likely weren’t sufficient legal cause to fire Cook. Under the law governing the Fed, governors can only be removed “for cause,” which Cobb said was limited to actions taken during a governor’s time in office.

The “removal of a Federal Reserve Governor extends only to concerns about the Board member’s ability to effectively and faithfully execute their statutory duties, in light of events that have occurred while they are in office,” Cobb wrote. Cobb was appointed by President Joe Biden, a Democrat.

“President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook’s removal,” the ruling added.

The decision means Cook will be able to participate in the Fed’s meeting Sept. 16-17, when it is expected to reduce its key short-term rate by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25%.

Federal Reserve governors aren’t like cabinet secretaries and the law doesn’t allow a president to fire them over policy disagreements or because he simply wants to replace them. Congress sought to insulate the Fed from political pressure, the court noted, by giving Fed governors long, staggered terms that make it unlikely a president can appoint a majority of the board in a single term.

“Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law,” Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a written statement. “Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.”

The court also directed the Fed’s board of governors and its chair, Jerome Powell, “to allow Cook to continue to operate as a member of the Board for the pendency of this litigation.”

Lowell had argued in court filings that Cook was entitled to a hearing and a chance to respond to the charges before being fired but was not provided either. The court agreed that she was not provided due process by the Trump administration. Her lawsuit denied the charges but did not provide more details.

Cook-Trump case is latest power struggle over independence of Federal Reserve

The case could become a turning point for the 112-year-old Federal Reserve. No president has sought to fire a Fed governor before. Economists prefer independent central banks because they can do unpopular things like lifting interest rates to combat inflation more easily than elected officials.

Many economists worry that if the Fed falls under the control of the White House, it will keep its key interest rate lower than justified by economic fundamentals to satisfy Trump’s demands for cheaper borrowing. That could accelerate inflation and could also push up longer-term interest rates, such as those on mortgages and car loans. Investors may demand a higher yield to own bonds to offset greater inflation in the future, lifting borrowing costs for the U.S. government, and the entire economy.

If Trump can replace Cook, he may be able to gain a 4-3 majority on the Fed’s governing board. Trump appointed two board members during his first term and has nominated a key White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to replace Adriana Kugler, another Fed governor who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on Miran’s nomination.

Trump has said he will only appoint to the Fed people who will support lower rates.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell and the other members of the Fed’s interest-rate setting committee for not cutting the short-term interest rate they control more quickly. It currently stands at 4.3%, after Fed policymakers reduced it by a full percentage point late last year. Trump has said he thinks it should be as low as 1.3%, a level that no Fed official and few economists support.

Powell recently signaled that the central bank was leaning toward cutting its rate at its meeting next week.

COMING UP: The fate of hundreds of unaccompanied minor children hangs in the balance as a federal judge, Tim Kelly, weighs whether to block their summary removal from the United States. At 2 p.m. ET, Kelly will hear argument on the children’s motion to enjoin their deportation. Follow along ⬇️ 🧵

BACKGROUND: In the middle of the night on Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration rounded up dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children and put them on airplanes for deportation. That prompted speedy intervention by Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who temporarily halted their summary removal. 2/

Now a different judge, Tim Kelly, must decide whether to grant longer-term relief while the children litigate their case. Kelly is a Trump appointee. More details in my @lawfare piece: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-judicial-learning-curve

THE LAW: In theory, the law is supposed to protect these children from being whisked out of the country by the government at a moment’s notice. A statute, the TVPRA, says unaccompanied children not from Mexico or Canada must be placed in immigration court proceedings & provided access to counsel.

The government basically takes the view that it can ignore the TVPRA. It points to a subsection of the HSA of 2002, which provides that, among other things, the Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for “reuniting unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.""

The government says this “reunification” provision allows ORR to ""reunite"" unaccompanied children with their parents in Guatemala without regard to the statutory protections set out in the TVPRA. Frankly, it's a really insane argument, and its implications are staggering.

The other thing you need to know is that the government previously told Judge Sooknanan that all of the parents of these children had requested their return to Guatemala. But DOJ has since dropped that claim (because it quickly became clear that it was utterly false).

Ok here we go. Judge Kelly is on the bench, and counsel for the children is up first. It's Efren Olivares representing them today. (Audio isn't great so bear with me)

Judge Kelly begins with questions about voluntary departure, which a child can apply for in the course of immigration proceedings.

Judge: You all argue that for voluntary departure an immigration judge must sign off -- do you agree statute doesn't require final order of removal? Olivares argues once child is in immigration proceedings, judge has final word. But Kelly seems to want a statute or reg that says that.

Kelly then says that a lot of the plaintiffs arguments are about things DHS can't do, but it's essentially HHS taking this action (because the ""reunification"" provision applies to ORR, a division of HHS, which has custody of the children).

Judge Kelly: TVPRA says need to place child in removal proceedings, but that only kicks in if DHS is seeking to remove a child, not some other agency taking action pursuant to some other statute. What's plaintiff response to idea that it's not DHS doing anything here, it's HHS/ORR?

Olivares points to 6 USC 269c, saying that nothing in that section transfers authority to ORR away from immigration judges/other officials who adjudicate immigration benefits under the INA

The discussion turns to imminence and irreparable harm, but the audio starts going in and out......😩 Seems to be back now, however.

Judge is asking about whether he has to find that the plaintiffs should irreparable harm for the entire class. What if they showed for 95%, but not 5% of. the proposed class? Olivares says that's not a bar to the requested relief.

Judge Kelly mentions that the gov claims that they aren't including anyone with a pending asylum claim in the repatriation program. Why should those people be included in class?

Olivares basically says that the government can't be taken at its word. Evidence in record is that there are children who have pending applications...others don't but that's not what the statute requires.

Judge Kelly asks about language for proposed order. What would he include? Olivares says they are requesting that he certify a class of all unaccompanied minors not from countries contiguous with the US (so, not Mexico or Canada)

Olivares also mentions a separate issue the plaintiffs wanted to raise, which is that some of the kids who were woken up in the middle of the night and taken to the airport were in long term foster care but were placed in a shelter when they returned from the airport.

Now Sarah Welch is up for DOJ. Judge Kelly wants to start with questions about ""the facts."" I was struck by the fact that the government's representations have seemed to ""evolve,"" he says.

To that end, Judge Kelly notes that Drew Ensign told Judge Sooknanan that all of the parents requested the return of the children. He cites a Guatemalan government report, published by Reuters days later, which says that none of the parents requested/wanted their return.

Welch basically says she can't make any representations on that point. The audio is poor, but she says something to the effect that a record hasn't been developed on that point.

Judge asks if he should treat the government's earlier representation as withdrawn. Welch says she can't make representations on that point. Judge Kelly says ok, so I should treat that as withdrawn. Then he asks if the gov's plans have changed based on info that parents didn't request return.

Welch, for DOJ, says the government's plans haven't changed. The government's view is that a parental request for return is not required. This is initiated and requested by the government of Guatemala.

Now Judge Kelly wants to know if the government plans to reassess for the children whose attorneys have now objected to their removal. Welch says the objection would have to be credible fear based or some other disqualifying claim. ""Mere"" objection of ""I don't want to return"" not sufficient

Judge Kelly: Government says there were 300-something kids eligible at first, but that has been whittled down. But could that number grow, children be added? Welch says there are children arriving across the border, continuing to enter ORR custody.

Judge Kelly asks about plans for repatriation of kids from other non-contiguous countries (countries that aren't Guatemala). You represented no immediate plans, he says. Does government reserve right to do that in middle of night on weekend, as it did with these kids?

Welch: I think everyone can agree it's unfortunate that the children were frightened and woken up in the middle of the night.

Judge Kelly asks about assurance [from Guatemalan gov] that children won't be trafficked upon return. Do you have anything else you can share about what specifically that assurance was? Welch says she doesn't have more information she can share.

Ok, now we're onto legal arguments. Welch begins to set out the government's view that 6 USC 279 provides ORR with independent statutory authority and that ""reunification""/""repatriation"" are different from ""removal""...then audio cuts out, briefly. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/6/279

Kelly summarizes the view: Government takes view that this statute gives government other way to make person leave the country that is not ""removal"" under the INA/TVPRA. It overrides other immigration statutes...Are there other examples you can point to that do that?

Welch doesn't have any other examples she can point to. But she says it's not surprising that Congress would carve out multiple routes that pay ""particular attention to"" the need of unaccompanied alien children who are a particularly vulnerable population.

When Kelly asks a version of the same question again, Welch says that though she's not aware of any other statute that does something like this, she's also not aware of any other statute that transfers custody over migrants to a different agency (as 6 USC 279 does for ORR)

Kelly: When has the government relied on this construction of the statute before? I get there is one case about someone being released to a UK embassy, but you're not saying the government thought it was lawful because of this reunification authority? This is 1st time gov has made argument in court?

Welch can't point to a specific example of the government making this argument in court before.

Judge Kelly asks about the fact that the plaintiffs have declarations from a lot of the children who say they don't want to go back. Is it fair to say that I just don't have much to consider [from the government] to the contrary?

Welch: I agree that we don't have declaration in record saying that, but plaintiffs say they do not dispute that some child might want to go back...This makes the class fundamentally unsuitable for mandatory no opt-out class treatment...

Judge Kelly: Let's say I denied the PI. And a whole bunch of plaintiffs were removed. And then the case is litigated and I find they do have a right to removal proceedings. Is the government's representation that those plaintiffs would then be returned?

Welch says that her understanding is that removal is not categorically irreparable harm because a person in general can be returned to the United States.

Judge Kelly: Any affirmative points we did not get to? In response, Welch mentions two cases brought by similarly situated children in Arizona and Chicago. (The proceedings are ongoing in those cases, with a PI hearing scheduled in AZ tomorrow) Then Olivares is back up.

He first mentions a statutory subsection requiring that an order for voluntary departure be issued by an immigration judge. Then he talks about class relief. He says government can't avoid class certification by offering relief to named plaintiffs as a matter of grace. Cites AARP ruling by SCOTUS.

Olivares underscores that the government still has not denied that they might try to remove children from other countries under their ""reunification"" theory.

Addressing irreparable harm, Olivares points to a recent case that found irreparable harm when the prospect of removal involves risk of irremediable error. And again, he says, we haven't heard representation that this harm could be reversed.

Judge Kelly: What is your response to the government's argument that there are children who don't face harm once they get back to Guatemala and could later be brought back...What's your response that person doesn't face irreparable harm because removal is not irreparable harm?

Olivares says that they don't need to show irreparable harm for every single class member.

Olivares turns things over to Rupa Bhattacharyya, who addresses a few additional legal arguments for class certification.

Judge Kelly summarily concludes, saying that he'll get a decision to the parties as soon as possible. And we're done. Thanks all for following along!

Liveblog

At 2pm there will be a preliminary injunction hearing in the Guatemalan children case (LGML v. Noem). I hope to live-blog here for @Lawfare , as will colleague @Anna Bower on another platform. For bracing & thorough background, see Anna's piece here: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-judicial-learning-curve /1

If you recall, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan entered a temporary restraining order 8/31, barring the removals— govt calls them ""reunifications""—of Guatemalan children ages 10-17. Govt has admitted intent to deport 327 children, with the first 76 booked for departure at 10:45am ET on 8/31. ... /2

... Judge Sooknanan was just covering the emergency docket that day—it was Sunday Labor Day weekend—so now the case has been randomly assigned to Judge Tim Kelly, who must decide whether to extend the TROs into a preliminary injunction & whether to certify a class. ... /3

... The petitioners claim that the govt's attempted removal of the children violated the Trafficking Victims Protection & Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) (8 U.S. Code § 1232), which contemplates extensive protections for unaccompanied alien children (UACs). But ... /4

... the govt argues that an obscure provision (6 USC § 279(b)(1)(H) lets it, in essence, circumvent those rules to ""reunify"" children with parents or legal guardians. Petitioners say they've seen evidence govt plans to try same thing with Honduran & maybe Salvadoran children. ... /5

A report of the Guatemalan National Attorney Generals, issued last week, did *not* confirm the US govt's suggestion that Guatemalan parents/guardians were seeking return of their children. None of those surveyed were. ... /6

Judge Kelly has taken the bench. /7

[sound is a little soft] Start with plaintiffs lawyer Efrén C. Olivares. Judge: you all argue in papers that for voluntary departure child must either receive an order -- that Immigration judge must sign off -- do you agree statute doesn't require final order of removal? /8

Olivares: we agree , doesn't require ... [sound is soft.] Judge: does judge have to sign off -- is that law, or a reg, or a practice. it doesn't seem to say that. O: once a child is in proceedings, IJ has the final word. /9

Judge: and source of that--just inherent in nature of proceedings? O: yes, inherent in the spirit of INA. J: assuming the child wants to leave US as soon as possible -- just assuming -- and child is in removal proceedings, and child wants to leave ... how long would that take? /10

O: refer to exhibit from former immigration judge ... takes [long time] J: even where child wants to go back? ... OK. Defs say the authority they're exercising is [different]. ... placement in removal proceedings is only when DHS seeks to remove child. not some other agency. so ... /11

... Judge Kelly cont: what do you make of that argument. saying it's not DHS doing something, it's HHS doing something, so it's not covered. that's outside scope of the statute's you sight. O: i'd point to 6 USC 269c ... nothing transfers authority away from [immigration judges] /12

J: govt argues that 8 USC 1252f1 bars me from granting injunctive relief. O: that provision was enacted before the TVPRA. not covered by it. ... J: In order for me to grant preliminary injunction to class do i have to find that each class member would suffer irreparable harm or ... /13

O: we think entire class is at risk. court is empowered to prevent imminent harm J: so your view is that even for minors who are not Guatemalan ... you've made broader request. ... for [noncontiguous] countries ... why is imminence requirement met? O: we've put before court /14

... evidence relating to other countries that tracks the same pattern. we've attempted to get govt [to reassure us they aren't doing that and they won't]. J: your comments suggest plaintiff could make up for imminence by irreparability. not sure that's 100% accurate. ... /15

.. J: you'd have to show some level of imminence here. O: correct. ... in case of Guatemala, imminence was a couple hours. we're trying to avoid another [attempt over the weekend to whisk them out of the country]. J: do you agree you have to show imminent harm for every class member? /16

J: if i found you'd shown irreparable harm for 95% of class, but 5% you hadn't. is that a bar to me? O: that is not. ... inability to show harm to small percentage of class not a bar ... been held in the circuit. recent cases cited in our brief. we've presented dozens of declarations from class members that show sufficient imminence of harm. /17

J: govt says: we disclaim that anybody with an asylum claim is part of our plan , whyh would those people be included? O: sorryt to say, we cannot take defs at their word. ... evidence in record that children who have pending applications ... others have not, but that's not what statute requires. /18

... J: the other example i'll throw out to you ... suppose a plaintiff who says i want to go back to guatemala. a person in that scenario ... tell me why that person ... you have a showing of irreparable harm for that person. O: in that hypo ... depends on age of child. ... /19

O: ... all we're asking is that the process be followed. we're not trying to stop that [in that hypothetical example]. J: and that lack of that procedure is irreparable harm? O: correct. J: So loss of process -- even if child is saying i want to go back -- the loss of those required procedure is irreparable harm in and of itself. /20

O: yes, in the case of that hypothetical child, and we don't have that case before us. J: should have said ... obviously ... any child that you have a declaration for saying if i go back i have risk of being trafficked or abused--goes without saying [there's irreparable harm for him/her]. /21

J: do you have any -- you've given me a proposed order -- but anything else , other language you think is important to prevent irreparable harm for whatever class i [certify] O: requesting no repatriation of any UAC from any country other than Mexico or Canada. [law is different for those countries.] /22

O: some of the children woken up in middle of night and taken to buses and airport ... in longterm foster care. now they've been put in group shelters. we'd ask that be sent back to their longerm foster care homes. ... that's come to light in last few days. /23

J: those are the questions i had. anything else you want to make sure i get? O: my co-counsel can address questions about the class you may have. otherwise that's all. DOJ counsel Sarah Welch: J: first some questions on facts. ... /24

J: i was struck how govt's reps as to subgroup of children who were planned to be sent to guatemala ... struck by gov't's representations with respect to tgheir parents. you told judge sooknanan they all had parents in guatemala waiting for them. i have before me recorrd from guatemala AG how few parents they were even able to locate. None had requested they come back. /25

J: do you all contest what that report lays out? if not, has that altered what govt plans to do? W: i don't have anything ... no to that question. [can't hear her voice; too soft] J: should assume representation made to judge sooknanan was wrong? W: i can't affirmatively represent that. J: does that mean govt's plans have changed? /26

DOJ atty Welch: i'm not aware of any change. our view is that parental request is not required. ... govt of US working with govt of guatemala on this. J: even if not req'd by statute, but it was certainly an important key fact that govt leaned on in arguing to Judge Sooknanan. that this was consensual. more than consensual. parents were asking. /27

J: Ok. put parents aside. now we have some children who you had identified as ""eligible"" that in the group of 327 ... at least 5 of those as named plaintiffs here who say they dont want to go back. i guess the question is: does that change the govt's plans for these kids? /28

W: it certainly does. ... [too soft for me to here] we've already determined 5 of 10 named plaintiffs not eligible. the remaining 5 now have attys ... so under our criteria, none are eligible. J: because other attys objected? W: the attys in the courtroom. /29

J: does govt plan ... to circle back and see whether other plaintiffs object to going back W: a number of other objections have come in. J: so for anyone for whom a lawyer has objected—that kicks the person out of eligibility? W: [yes] J: do all 327 have attys? W: they didn't as of 8/31. now many more do. /30

J: for that group ... who doesn't have an atty , is the govt planning to initiate some sort of process to see whether the [child?] objects? W: [couldn't hear] J: you're not ruling out that there's some group of folks who do not have a lawyer and govt does not know if child objects ... would child remain ""eligible"" for [reunification] /31

W: mere objection would not disqualify the child. J: [what about plans for doing this for UACs from other countries] W: my understsanding is govt doesn't have immediate plans for any other country. no immediate actions. J: that 327 number has been whittled down ... is there a possibility of adding to it? W: do think it's possible. children arriving across border now. or [voice too soft] ... /32

Judge: now let's talk about ... what if anything can govt represent about another group of guatemalan children or from other noncontiguous countries -- you said no certain or immediate plans. Does govt reserve right to do that in middle of night on weekend. W: can't think of a reason for doing that. everyone agrees it was unfortunate children were frightened. /33

Judge: if plaintiffs are right and children have to be put into removal proceedings but are eligible for voluntary departure -- tell me about that process. what's required in statute, reg, practice. and how long it takes. ... Welch: i don't have statistics. ... not aware there's a statute that requires judicial approval. /34

Judge: but is that the typical [way the process works]. i mean judge oversees that ... typically signs off in some way. Welch: not sure I can [answer] what the practice is. J: One of the criteria for eligibility was that govt was given assurances by Guatemala that the child wouldn't be trafficked. W: yes. /35

J: do you have any more info about that representation. what the assurance was? W: i don't have more i can share. ... multiple communications with Guatemala thru dept of state. J: the part of the statute that to me gave you all the most [trouble?] is part that describes -- 1232a5C -- talks about repatriation ... hard for me to read that and conclude you could repatriate someone without removing them. W: /36

W: [didn't catch her response] J: so under your reading, repatriation and reunification are different concepts, different authorities. W: repatriation in 1232 is broader than reunification [in 6 USC 279] J: so your argument is the authority you lay out creates another way for a person to leave the US that is not removal. ... /37

J: ... so it effectively overrides the INA. (Immigration and Nationality Act) . any other examples of authority you can point to where congress said, okay, we're going to carve out these people and say INA doesn't apply to them? W: first, dont have another example to offer at this point. /38

W: but i dont think it's circumventing the IRA. Congress has set up multiple routes. ... not surprising to see separate ways children could leave the US J: does it seem strange to you that under your reading the procedures that children from noncontinguous countries -- is it govt's view that same reunification authority could be used in case of someone from canada or mexico? W: yes, and it has been. /39

J: okay, but there's no other group you can think of where congress said i'm going to hand authority to an official outside DHS. ... It's another pathway to kick someone out of the country. or have them leave the country. W: the INA is a particular enactment. Transfers functions from DHS to HHS. Body of immigration laws is what court now has before it. /40

W: .. I'm not aware of other aliens that someone other than DHS has authority. J: isn't it fair to think -- construing the words themselves -- it strikes me that removal is a word that suggests exit from the US. but it doesn't say where or how or under what circumstances. /41

J: ... and the word reunification suggests something that occurs after you're removed. after you leave. isn't it natural to think of repatriation and reunification as capturing a separate set of things, something congress adds on and says, OK, we're not going to just drop these people off in middle of ocean or bring them to port of entry and say good luck ... /42

J: ... so they specify some things that happen afterward to make sure they wind up in the right country and right place. why isn't that nature reading of those terms. W: not sure i'd agree that reunification refers to something that occurs after ... in the abstract, removal is suggesting an external force in a way that's different from reunification. /43

W: removal is a word used throughout immigration statutes in way reunification doesn't. separate mechanism that allows children to be returned to parents abroad. J: ... construing a statute court can look to practice. ... /44

J: ... i don't think you can point to cases involving mexico and canada [because law is different for them]. [Now they're discussing an example involving a release to the UK.] J: certainly this is first time -- sunday labor day weekend is first time govt made that argument to a court, right? W: not aware [of another]. /45

J: and the issue of what to do with UACs from noncontiguous countries is not a good one. W: yes ... but numbers have changed in recent years ... spiked to tremendous pressing problem. J: no reason to doubt what you're saying but it gets a little tricky in terms of govt arguing this is longstanding interpretation when canada & mexico examples are [different]. You do have one example but ... /46

J: ... when you have ambassador saying i've got the parents right here .. that's different. waht's gov't's position on (a) whether these children are entitled to notice & opportunity to be heard; and (b) was what govt did over labor day weekend sufficient? W: we do think it was sufficient for due process. ... /47

W: these are children in govt custody. notice goes to caregiver. not to child. ... children do have limited due process rights when they are in govt custody. J: your briefing is replete with references to children wanting to return home. obviously you don't have to prove that. but you offered it up as [going to] the equities. but as of right now i dont think i have any evidence of anyone ... /48

J: ... in the putative class who affirmatively wishes to go back to Guatemala. Is that something ... it drops out of the analysis. you dont have to prove it. but ... W: agree we dont have declaration in record saying that. but plaintiffs say they do not dispute that some child might want to go back ... that makes this class unsuited for [Rule 23] (b)(2) mandatory no-opt-out class treatment.

J: I dont think plaintiffs are asking me to bar any plaintiff from voluntary departure. W: they've told the court that that takes weeks or months. not all classmembers [may want that]. most of these children are in our shelters. ORR's [Office of Refugee Resettlement] job is to pursue the best interests of the child. ... this is case that's fundamentally unsuited for b2 certification. /50

J: i take your point that plaintiffs dont rule out that some of the Guatemalan children -- there might be some child in there who wants to be sent back. can't rule that out. question is, what does that mean for purposes of class certification W: significance: not disagreeing that's an individualized determination for each child. so that's not susceptible to classwide proof. /51

J: for purposes of thinking about a class and irreparable harm, what do you take as import of -- let me back up. you just laid out your view with respect to class certification because of that concession by plaintiffs. let me ask in terms of irreparable harm: is it govt's view ... /52

J: ... that with respect to irreparable harm, fact that every member of class might be facing irreparable harm, that doesn't bar me from certifying class? W: we don't agree. they're requesting several different classes. J: because of imminence? because you've removed some from table? W: right. no irreparable harm if they don't risk leaving the country. /53

J: it's a black box what a particular plaintiff wants and what would happen to them if they go back. might reunite with parents. might be in foster situation. could class capture some who might not be at risk? W: i don't think so. if that child doesn't face risks in Guatemala. if doesn't face any risks of harm in Guatemala and could be returned to US in case of mistake. /54

J: what is govt's view--you brought up returningn to the country. are you representing--let's say i denied preliminary injunction and whole bunch of plaintiffs left the country to Guatemala. and eventually i found that they were entitled to be placed in removal proceedings. is it your position that govt would consent to have them returned? /55

W: my understanding is that removal is not categoricallly understood to be irreparable harm under SCOTUS precedent because person can be returned to u.s. J: that's correct. W: that's precisely why removal is not irreparable harm. person can be returned to US after final judgment. /56

J: do you have, in class context, a case that stands for proposition that every single person who's a member of the class without exception would have to be facing irreparable harm? W: i agree ... everyone needs to be at risk of the challenged action. plaintiffs have conceded that child's best interests is fact-intensive individualized question. /57

J: you're conflating best interest of the child with irreparable harm. one final question: you're telling me no named plaintiff is now at risk from the challenged action, what is the legal import of that W: there is no class rep who can adequately represent that class or whose claims are typical of the class. /58

W: ... none of the class members is eligible for reunification. J: because none of the named plaintiffs are still eligible [for reunification]. Anything else? Welch: i do want to mention 2 other cases. District of Arizona. no request for class certification in that case. PI hearing tomorrow. another in NDIll. 4 plaintiffs. /59

J: plaintiffs counsel, anything you want to add? O: yes a few points. to clarify: request for voluintary departure must be granted by immigration judge. [he cites the statute]. [8 usc 1229c. (?)] also want to be clear: ORR never notified even attys of children who were represented. ORR notified caregivers. /60

as far as class certification, in AARP .. there were only 2 named plaintiffs, and SCOTUS ... said the govt can't avoid class relief by offering individual named plaintiffs relief as matter of grace. Also, we did not hear denial that they may eventually try to take children [from other countries out of the country under the same theories.] /61

O: On the issue of relationship between the 2 statutes here. the TVPRA is much more specific statute. J: it's more specific than which? O: than title 6 USC 279b1h. ... doesn't mean courts can disregard other statutes ... as for example of child from United kIngdom--that child was sent from UK to be reunited with grandmother. no indication [what process was followed] ... /61

J: govt says that supports their position that they were using an authority outside the INA. as far as facts go, i think we're all on same page, though. O: on irreparable harm: WMM v Trump ... when prospect of removal involves risk of irremediable error. J: where? O: 5th circuit court of appeals. /62

O: here 11 children have expressed fear of removal. fear of torture , persecution. J: i hear you on that. what is your response to govt's argument that ... with respect to a particular member of the class that doesn't face harm—fact that that person exists. govt makes argument that if mistake is made they can be brought back. /63

O: a few responses. we do not have to show irrep harm for every single member of class. also, child might be eligible for another form of relief here and might miss out on that if taken to Guatemala. Now his co-counsel will address some questions: Rupa Bhattacharyya: [she cites a precedent she says addresses govt's arguments about class certification] /64

B: second, [i think it's incredibly telling that] in face of incredibly reticulated statute [protecting rights of children] the govt points to a section of a different law of less than a dozen words [in 279b1H]. it's simply not the way the law works. the more specific law always triumphs over the more general. /65

B: third, no req't that every member has to face irreparable harm. ... AARP supports that proposition. whole purpose of having class representatives is to J: govt says you dont have any class reps at moment. the other 5 excluded earlier by their criteria, and now the other 5 are excluded. B: 2 responses ... /66

Here's what we ... - CNN,"Chris Boyette, Taylor Romine",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/11/us/katie-abraham-chicago-immigration-crackdown,"Abraham and Polzin were childhood friends from their time at the East Side Water Polo Club in the Chicago suburbs.
The death of the youngest daughter Joe Abraham’s youngest daughter loved water.
She loved all kinds of music, and Joe Abraham recalled sitting together and listening to music from his generation.
I’m just in this position now,” Joe Abraham told CNN.
He was using an alias … and really was not being any type of a productive person here in Illinois,” Joe Abraham told CNN.","Katie Abraham and Chloe Polzin were hunting for a late-night snack with three other friends on a frigid night in Urbana, Illinois.

The end of winter break was nearing for the two university students, who had traveled to Urbana to visit other water polo players at the University of Illinois, Abraham’s father told CNN.

It was nearly 2 a.m. on January 19 when 20-year-old Abraham and 21-year-old Polzin, along with their friends, stopped at a red light. Suddenly, an SUV came up quickly behind them, smashing into the car and injuring all five people inside, according to Urbana Police.

The two girls were killed in a drunken-driving hit-and-run collision, the Department of Homeland Security said, by a man in the United States illegally who fled the scene of the crime.

Abraham was pronounced dead at the hospital soon after the accident, police said. Polzin died the next day, according to her obituary.

Almost eight months after Abraham’s death, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching its latest immigration enforcement action in Illinois, “Operation Midway Blitz,” in her honor, drawing the 20-year-old’s name into national politics as an example of a broken immigration system amid a larger crackdown in cities across the US.

Her father, Joe Abraham, told CNN the federal government failed “miserably” in protecting his daughter and that state politicians ignored her death, and by extension, “let it happen.”

What we know about the wreck

Temperatures had dropped as low as 2 degrees the night Abraham died, and never broke above freezing that day.

Abraham and Polzin were childhood friends from their time at the East Side Water Polo Club in the Chicago suburbs.

The two girls, along with three other friends, were sitting at a red light just 1.5 miles north of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign when a red Mitsubishi Outlander crashed into the back of their car, police said.

All five were taken to the hospital, according to police. While two were released with minor injuries and another made a recovery, Abraham was declared dead at the hospital. Polzin was declared brain dead the next day, according to her obituary.

The Polzin family did not respond to CNN’s attempts to speak with them for this story.

Police said the driver fled the scene on foot. Three days later, the US Marshals Service found him in Texas, riding a bus headed to Mexico.

The death of the youngest daughter

Joe Abraham’s youngest daughter loved water.

“I think she liked the water better than land,” her father said.

She played water polo for a travel team throughout high school and for a club team in college. She swam and did diving from a young age, he said.

Abraham, who was from Glenview, Illinois, was going into her third year at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, according to her father. She wasn’t certain yet, but he thinks she was leaning toward majoring in marketing. They intended to talk about it the next time she was home.

“She kind of had a plan of where she was going to go, and obviously that didn’t happen,” he said.

Joe Abraham said his daughter “loved life, and she knew how to enjoy it, and get the best out of it.”

He called her “such a special person,” who was genuine and authentic. She made everyone feel seen and had a terrific wit and a great sense of humor, he added.

She loved all kinds of music, and Joe Abraham recalled sitting together and listening to music from his generation.

She had an “eclectic group of friends,” and two siblings with whom she was close.

“She was just such a good sister to her older sister and older brother,” her father said. “It’s a sad, sad situation.”

What we know about the SUV driver

US Marshals tracked down the SUV driver three days after he fled the scene of the crime on an “El Expreso” bus – “the express” – heading to Matamoros, Mexico.

The man told police he was a 27-year-old Mexican named Juan Jahaziel Saenz-Suarez the morning he was captured. But a day later, he divulged to police that his identity was a lie – he was 29, from Guatemala. His name was actually Julio Cucul-Bol.

He was not legally in the United States and had used forged documents to hide his identity, police said.

Police filed new charges against Cucul-Bol for leaving the scene of a personal injury crash resulting in death, aggravated driving under the influence resulting in death and reckless homicide.

Federal prosecutors charged Cucul-Bol in May with possessing a false permanent resident card, possessing a false Social Security card, false use of a passport, and making a false statement on a bank application, according to the Department of Justice.

In February, Immigration and Customs Enforcement lodged an arrest detainer requesting local authorities notify ICE before Cucol-Bol is released, the agency told CNN. According to ICE records, he is being held in custody in Champaign, Illinois.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for an update on Cucul-Bol’s status. Court documents online do not list the name of a defense attorney for Cucul-Bol.

A death drawn into a political arena

Joe Abraham said the federal government first reached out to him in June, when House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer invited him to attend a committee meeting where Democratic governors – including J.B. Pritzker of Illinois – testified about their states’ so-called “sanctuary state” policies.

He said he had hoped to speak with Pritzker after the Illinois governor heard his daughter’s story, but told CNN, “No one could muster up even a look in my direction.”

A few weeks later, he said, he and his wife were contacted by the Trump administration and invited to the White House for an event for Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”

“Joe, we will end this invasion once and for all, and we’re always going to remember the memory of Katie, the beautiful, beautiful 20-year-old daughter of yours,” Trump told him before shaking his hand and holding up a photo of the father and daughter.

“I don’t want to get political. I hate this crap. I’m just in this position now,” Joe Abraham told CNN.

He criticized the current Illinois government and the previous presidential administration for mishandling immigration and called for a vetting process before people are allowed in the country.

“Don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying everyone’s a criminal. What I’m saying is this guy in particular could have easily been filtered out of the system. He was using an alias … and really was not being any type of a productive person here in Illinois,” Joe Abraham told CNN. “And for him to take her life is a very sad state.”

Abraham’s parents were featured in a video posted by the Department of Homeland Security earlier this week, where the agency announced it was launching an immigration operation in Illinois.

A question appears in overlaid text on the video: “When you hear people say illegal aliens aren’t given due process, what’s your reaction?”

“Katie received no due process,” Joe Abraham says in the video.

“When you talk about due process, I wish she was in another country or in some detention center I can go see her, but she’s not, and I’ll never see her again.”

The Department of Homeland Security called Joe Abraham one day before the agency announced Operation Midway Blitz would be done in honor of their daughter.

“Some might say they’re leveraging me, but maybe we’re leveraging them a little bit so other kids don’t get killed, and other parents don’t have to go see what we’re going through,” he said. “So, maybe it’s a two-way street there. I was just happy someone acknowledged Katie.”

What is Operation Midway Blitz?

DHS on Monday announced “Operation Midway Blitz,” aimed at targeting “criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained at least five people over the weekend, including a flower vendor and a person waiting for the bus, Chicago Alderperson Jeylú Gutiérrez said Monday.

Ongoing arrests in Chicago are expected to expand as a federal presence builds up in a weeks-long, phased approach, according to officials familiar with the plans who stressed it’s still in flux.

The operations in Boston and Chicago are modeled after the June immigration sweeps in Los Angeles. The Supreme Court ruled Monday that immigration enforcement officials can continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the Fourth Amendment.

Pritzker denounced the DHS operations in the state Monday, saying in a post on X that the operation “isn’t about fighting crime.”

“That requires support and coordination — yet we’ve experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,” he said, adding that the administration has chosen to focus “on scaring Illinoisians.”

At that point immigration would be the main driver of new population growth instead of births.
Zoom out: The CBO previously said the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million in 2055.
Now, the agency says the population will be smaller and will grow more slowly, reaching only 367 million by 2055.
The population would also contain fewer working-age people — a hit to the labor supply that could slow economic growth.","The U.S. population will be smaller and grow more slowly than previously projected, a result of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration, per newly revised Congressional Budget Office estimates out Wednesday.

Why it matters: It's an economic red flag, with the potential to drive labor shortages, higher prices and a crisis of care for the nation's elderly.

State of play: Deaths are projected to start exceeding births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected, as a result of the White House crackdown, plus increased funding for immigration enforcement in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, leaving fewer immigrant families to have children and add to the population.

At that point immigration would be the main driver of new population growth instead of births.

Fertility rates have also declined slightly more than expected, per the CDC, since the agency published its January projection.

Catch up quick: The CBO had already revised down its growth projections in January, after the Biden administration cut back on immigration.

But the nonpartisan agency's latest estimates take into account the current administration's more aggressive recent actions, as well as the new legislation.

Zoom in: The CBO is now projecting that 290,000 immigrants will be ""removed"" from from the country, due to the new law, from 2026 - 2029.

Another 30,000 would leave voluntarily.

Zoom out: The CBO previously said the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million in 2055.

Now, the agency says the population will be smaller and will grow more slowly, reaching only 367 million by 2055.

The population would also contain fewer working-age people — a hit to the labor supply that could slow economic growth.

Reality check: The CBO says its projections are highly uncertain.

The estimates also swing significantly with policy shifts.

Between the lines: There are some predicting that the population could actually start declining as soon as this year because of net negative immigration— or more people leaving the country then coming in.

That would be a recipe for economic stagnation, as economic writer Derek Thompson has recently outlined. Think fewer working-age people to pay into Social Security, harvest crops, build homes, staff restaurants or provide health care.

Yes, but: The CBO is still predicting positive net immigration in 2025, mainly because of an increase of lawful permanent residents that offset big declines in unauthorized immigration.

What to watch: A three-year economic forecast based on these projections is due out Friday.",https://images.axios.com/pCJeVF37icIWNT5yOBz_lKP8icg=/0x0:1344x756/1366x768/2025/09/10/1757537586139.png,N,,2025-09-11 06:56:16.466497

The Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America filed suit against the Tennessee law just days before it took effect July 1.

The denomination argued the law, passed as part of a Republican effort to align state policy with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, puts pastors and church members at risk for criminal charges in carrying out their faith-driven mission to offer shelter and sanctuary to individuals regardless of immigration status.

Lawyers for the Synod argued that the law is an infringement on religious freedom, vaguely written and illegally sets immigration policy, a responsibility that falls to Congress.

A Nashville landlord, concerned about criminal charges for renting to an immigrant without legal status, and an unidentified immigrant from Mexico are also plaintiffs in the suit.

An attorney defending the measure argued that pastors had a “needless fear of the law.”

Suit seeks to block Tennessee law that makes it a crime to “harbor” certain immigrants

The law makes it a crime to harbor immigrants “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain” and is intended to apply to “professional smuggling operations,” not churches that accept donations to provide services to those in need, argued Miranda Jones, senior assistant attorney general.

U.S. District Judge William Campbell, Jr. urged lawyers on both sides to agree on a compromise that would spell out that the law, at least temporarily, would not be enforced against members of the Lutheran Synod.

That effort failed once Jones told Campbell her superiors in the Tennessee Office of Attorney General would not agree; the state’s position is the law won’t target houses of worship, making a written agreement between the two parties unnecessary, she said.

“It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me,” Campbell responded. “It’s difficult to understand the harm.”

Campbell instead required the attorneys to report to the court if any individuals represented in the suit faced arrest or prosecution under the new law.

Thus far, no one has been charged with a crime under the new law, Jones said.

Campbell deferred a decision on the request to temporarily halt the portion of state law that makes it a felony offense to harbor immigrants in the country illegally, saying he would “take it under advisement.”

Attorney General James led 20 other attorneys general in a lawsuit challenging the federal government’s reinterpretation of a decades-old law governing access to social services. Today, a federal court granted Attorney General James and the coalition’s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking sweeping new rules that threatened to strip funding from programs like Head Start, Title X family planning clinics, food banks, domestic violence shelters, adult education, and community health centers.

“The Trump administration tried to rip apart the very programs that millions of families rely on to survive – from Head Start classrooms to cancer screenings to community food banks,” said Attorney General James. “Today’s ruling makes clear that their unlawful and cruel policies will not stand. With this victory, we are protecting children’s education, safeguarding critical health care, and preserving the safety net that keeps families afloat. I will never stop fighting to ensure every community has the resources and support they deserve.”

Earlier this summer, four federal agencies – the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (ED), Labor (DOL), and Justice (DOJ) – issued a coordinated set of directives abruptly redefining longstanding policy under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). For nearly 30 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike interpreted PRWORA to allow states to offer vital public health, education, and anti-poverty programs regardless of immigration status. The Trump administration’s sudden reversal would have forced states to impose immigration status verification on countless services under the threat of catastrophic funding losses and program closures.

The court’s decision halts implementation of those new directives in the plaintiff states while litigation proceeds, ensuring that millions of families can continue to access critical services without fear of denial or disruption. With this ruling, the judge is acknowledging that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by issuing sweeping new mandates without lawful rulemaking, grossly misreading PRWORA, and failing to consider the devastating impacts on states and communities.

The victory has immediate impacts across New York:

Head Start: Protects early education for more than 43,000 low-income children at nearly 1,000 sites statewide.

Community Health Centers: Safeguards access to primary and preventive care for 2.4 million New Yorkers who rely on 850 community clinics.

Title X Clinics: Ensures reproductive health, cancer screenings, and STI testing for more than 300,000 patients each year.

Mental Health Programs: Preserves over $65 million in annual funding for crisis intervention, youth mental health, peer support, the 988 suicide hotline, and jail diversion programs.

Anti-Poverty Services: Maintains food, housing, and utility assistance provided by New York’s 47 Community Action Agencies to more than half a million residents annually.

The order from the judge in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island applies to 20 states and the District of Columbia, whose attorneys general, all Democrats, sued the administration. It puts the administration's reinterpretation of a Clinton-era federal policy on hold while the case is decided.

Under the proposed changes, some community-level programs would be reclassified as federal public benefits, making them inaccessible to people without legal status. Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said in her order that the policy rollout was “rushed” in a way that would worsen the impact for people cut off from community services and those tasked with verifying eligibility.

“The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law,” McElroy wrote. “In its view, everyone ... has misunderstood it from the start — at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government. The Court is skeptical of that.”

Messages seeking comment were left with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Education Department, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice, which each were named as defendants.

The states’ lawsuit argued the government failed to follow the rulemaking process and did not provide the required notice on conditions placed on federal funds.

The rule changes had been paused initially within the states that sued after they reached a temporary agreement with the Trump administration.

“With this victory, we are protecting children’s education, safeguarding critical health care, and preserving the safety net that keeps families afloat,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said.

Proponents of Head Start immediately voiced concern that the new policy would harm immigrant communities by taking away health services and educational opportunities. The administrative burdens of implementing the new rule would cause many under-resourced Head Start programs to close, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint.

The federal government said it interprets Head Start as a federal public benefit, similar to welfare programs that exclude immigrants in the country illegally. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose agency oversees Head Start, said the directive would stop diverting “hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.”

In addition to preserving Head Start access, the lawsuit also sought to block the restrictions on other federal programs, including substance abuse services, mental health resources in schools, career and technical education, and job training opportunities.

Nevins, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/us-immigration-policy,"Even though undocumented workers pay taxes and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy, they still lack labor protection in U.S. labor laws.
This raises the question: How do we protect those who maintain our food system while they remain increasingly vulnerable?
These visas enable foreign nationals to obtain temporary work permits for agricultural jobs when local workers are unavailable.
What’s needed is reform that builds a stable, sustainable, and humane labor system for the future of American agriculture.
It's important to recognize that many migrant workers endure abuse and exploitation out of fear of deportation.","This reality isn’t unique to Missouri. It’s mirrored in agricultural communities across the country, where immigrant workers form the foundation of our food system.

Meatpacking is grueling, dangerous work. With injury rates three times the national average, hazards like amputations, high-speed production lines, and constant repetitive motions that can cause musculoskeletal issues are daily realities while on the floor. Workers must face long hours in cold, loud environments, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with little break time and limited, if any, access to personal protective equipment (PPE). These working conditions declined during the COVID pandemic and remain demanding today.

And in spite of the risks, undocumented laborers continue to make up a substantial portion of the workforce; about 23% of workers are undocumented, and 42% are foreign-born in this sector.

The U.S. is criminalizing the very people keeping it fed. Immigration crackdowns don’t just break up families; they break supply chains. That means meatpacking plants losing essential workers, farms going understaffed, and local economies potentially being pushed to the brink.

The meatpacking industry has a long history of worker exploitation, though.

Meatpacking plants were first built in large cities where workers had better access to unions and collective bargaining. However, new companies began relocating to rural areas, where union presence was weaker and labor costs were lower, effectively moving the industry away from its unionized roots.

With the move to rural areas, plants recruited Latin American immigrants to fulfill the low-wage, demanding jobs that native-born workers were less willing to do.

Even though undocumented workers pay taxes and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy, they still lack labor protection in U.S. labor laws. They live every day among escalated anti-immigrant rhetoric and threats of deportations and family separations hanging over their heads.

These workers are not transient, but rather embedded in the communities they help sustain. In fact, most undocumented immigrants in America have lived here for more than a decade.

Relying on a workforce without legal protections is an unsustainable and flawed model for employers and workers.

Mass deportations would weaken the economy, and the consequences would ripple across our food system. Unharvested crops, higher food prices for consumers, and reduced domestic food production can follow major labor shortages.

“You would see farms go out of business, and we could see interruption in our food supply,” testified American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this year.

This country and its people must find both a just and effective path forward for those who have repeatedly contributed to and are so vitally part of our success.

This raises the question: How do we protect those who maintain our food system while they remain increasingly vulnerable?

It is essential to recognize the role of H-2A visas in meeting agricultural labor needs. These visas enable foreign nationals to obtain temporary work permits for agricultural jobs when local workers are unavailable.

This system provides some assistance, but it also has its own financial and administrative barriers: its complex paperwork and high costs limit accessibility, especially for smaller farms. Simplifying the process, reducing expenses, and expanding the program to cover year-round positions would better meet the needs of farmers.

Visas fall far short of addressing the deeper, structural issues behind the agricultural workforce crisis. What’s needed is reform that builds a stable, sustainable, and humane labor system for the future of American agriculture.

Comprehensive immigration and labor reform is a long-term, politically complex process and goal.

In the meantime, we must focus on practical, community-based solutions.

One such approach is to invest in bilingual outreach and support networks that can advocate for workers. Partnerships like these should be expanded and permanently funded, not just in crisis moments throughout states.

In Missouri, the Migrant Farmworkers Assistance Fund (MFAF) provides essential bilingual case management and emergency assistance to migrant farmworkers and their families. The nonprofit’s staff meet with migrant workers upon their arrival at local orchards to help determine eligibility for public benefits, access medical and dental services, and assist with school enrollment for their children.

Monarch Immigrant Services, based in St. Louis, plays a vital role in promoting equity and stability for these groups as well. By providing mental health services, social support, legal assistance, language services, and senior engagement to over 3,000 individuals, they’re effectively working to invest in immigrant and refugee communities through equitable access to transformative services.

Local solutions can – and do – provide immediate relief. These services not only keep workers uplifted, but they also help them remain stable and resilient.

Another potential step is the adoption of fair labor certification programs that hold employers accountable and provide consumers with a means to support ethical practices, according to Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.

For example, the Equitable Food Initiative (EFI) works with farms to certify that produce is grown under safe, fair, and dignified conditions. Participating operations have the opportunity to integrate worker voice, foster collaboration between managers and workers, and recognize the value of all staff.

It's important to recognize that many migrant workers endure abuse and exploitation out of fear of deportation.

Groups like Centro de los Derechos del Migrante (CDM), a transnational organization aiding Mexico-based migrant workers in the U.S., assist migrant workers in confronting these injustices. Ensuring that labor migration policies reflect workers’ voices and priorities, CDM collaborates with workers to transform the power imbalances that harm people in the H-2A and other temporary work visa programs.

Promoting equitable practices in local agriculture and raising awareness about available resources can help safeguard the well-being of these essential community members. We must realize that protecting them is a shared responsibility.

It’s up to us to speak out for those who are too often silenced, even if, at times, it feels like our messages empty into an abyss. We cannot continue to accept the labor of undocumented workers while treating them as disposable. We cannot have a witch hunt and a workforce at the same time.

As someone whose community was once welcomed and rebuilt after war, I believe in this country’s ability to honor the dignity of all workers, regardless of status. We owe it to the people who feed us every day. They deserve more than fear and invisibility. They deserve protection, recognition, and a seat at the table.

Rios, director of American Friends Service Committee’s U.S.-Mexico Border Program, added that the Supreme Court this week legitimized those controversial tactics when it cleared the way for agents to stop people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that agents were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around Los Angeles.

On this episode of Border Report Live, Rios speaks with correspondent Salvador Rivera about the ruling and its effects on communities in Southern California. Rios said such tactics have been used in the past, and he argues that the ruling will erode the protections that many people have come to expect.

Other immigrant advocacy groups have said the ruling does not uphold the law or make our nation safer.

The El Paso-based Border Network for Human Rights issued a statement, saying Latino communities across the United States are facing an “unprecedented and unconstitutional campaign of abuse that has generated widespread fear and terror.”

“Let us be clear: this is no longer about immigration enforcement,” BNHR said in a statement. “It is state-sanctioned persecution of Latino communities. … It enables racial targeting, tears families apart, and erodes the constitutional protections that safeguard us all from authoritarian rule.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the Supreme Court’s stay “a win for the safety and security of the American people and the rule of law.”

“Our brave @DHSGov law enforcement will continue our operations in LA to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens that pose a danger to public safety,” Noem tweeted on Monday. “Make America Safe Again!”

Donna Hughes-Brown, 58, was arrested by ICE over a bad check for $25 she passed a decade ago, according to her husband. Born in England the grandmother holds Irish citizenship and first came to the U.S. with her parents and brother aged 11.

She visited the Republic of Ireland earlier this summer for a family funeral, only to be arrested when she returned to Chicago O’Hare International Airport on July 29.

She has since been detained for more than 30 days and held at a facility in Campbell County, Kentucky, with the U.S. government threatening to deport her over the check, which it argues was a “crime of moral turpitude,” despite her family saying she paid the money back long ago.

There is no statutory definition of moral turpitude but courts have found that it “refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile or depraved, contrary to the rules of morality,” according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Jim Brown – Donna’s husband of eight years, with whom she lives on a nine-acre farm in Troy, Missouri, and with whom she organizes charitable “blessing boxes” for struggling members of the local community – told Fox News’s Nevada affiliate KMOV of his anguish at his wife’s plight.

“It’s just not fair that you’re telling me I have to be a bachelor the rest of my life because of some stupid policy,” Brown said. “You don’t arrest 58-year-old grandmothers. It’s just wrong. She hasn’t committed crimes. You just don’t do that.”

Brown, a U.S. Navy veteran of 20 years’ service, has admitted to Newsweek that he voted for Donald Trump in last year’s presidential election but has quickly come to regret it “100 percent”.

“It’s egregious that we have allowed a government to allow this to happen,” he told KMOV, dismissing the case being made against his wife as “nonsense” and rubbishing the idea that she represents a flight risk. “I think it’s a blanket thing to catch everybody, to fill beds… They signed a stupid bill that is torturing innocent people, and that’s the problem.”

Brown added that he spends hours on the phone every day trying to reach his partner, protesting about the “deplorable” conditions in which she is being held and appealing for help from his state’s elected officials, so far to no avail.

The office of Missouri’s Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe sent him a letter advising him that his wife’s case was a “federal issue” only, he said.

“I want somebody to have the guts and the fortitude to stand up and say, ‘You know what? This is wrong’,” Brown said. “It’s crazy that this is happening. It’s just crazy that this is even allowed in this country. That’s the problem. It shouldn’t even be thought that this should be OK. My wife is not a criminal.”

The Independent has reached out to ICE for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security has previously said in a statement: “Lawful Permanent Residents presenting at a U.S. port of entry with certain criminal convictions may be found inadmissible, placed in removal proceedings, and subject to mandatory detention.

Without offering specifics, CBP said that during a migrant smuggling investigation in El Paso, a U.S. Border Patrol Agent ""was involved in a use of force incident"" involving a dog.

CBP stressed that it is taking the matter seriously and said it will provide more information when it becomes available, providing no mention of any migrants being found.

However, KFOX14/CBS4 spoke with a distraught family from the Upper Valley who claimed to have been the victims of this incident and said the agents went into the home and shot and killed their dog.

The father, who wished to remain anonymous, said Border Patrol agents in jeans and t-shirts showed up at his son's home looking for migrants after receiving a tip.

The son answered the door and, while he permitted the agents to search his home, claiming he had nothing to hide, he asked if they could wait first while he put the family dog, Chop, a Rottweiler, away in the bathroom before they walked in, as the dog could be aggressive.

RECOMMENDED:

Border Patrol agents then asked the son if he could show them some identification.

According to the family, it is at this point that the son went to his pickup truck to retrieve his ID and a Border Patrol agent entered the home and, as a result, ended up shooting the dog.

The family stressed that the agents knew-- the son had told them-- that Chop was put in the bathroom for their safety and that the agents opened the door, let Chop out and shot him.

The family appeared upset and disgusted by the agent's actions, saying that they were following orders and trying to be upstanding citizens, only for an agent to kill ""a family member.""

Furthermore, the family said none of the Border Patrol agents helped the family, who desperately tried to render aid to the dog, which bled to death on the kitchen floor.

WATCH:

Also, the family claims the agent who shot their dog then hid from them and refused to give his name.

The family said it is looking to pursue legal action and expressed concern that something like this could happen to other families.

The family added that when they confronted agents, Border Patrol reportedly told them they were working from an anonymous tip tied to the previous owners of the home, who lived there two years ago.

Some 475 employees, including 300 South Koreans, were taken into custody Thursday at the Savannah-area battery plant. Videos released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials showed the detained workers in shackles and chains. The raid shocked Seoul, a key U.S. ally, where people expressed a sense of betrayal by Washington.

The facility was part of a $4.3 billion joint venture that was slated for completion later this year. It was expected to create 8,500 jobs that would support the car company’s nearby electric vehicle plan, but construction on the factory was put on pause after the raid.

Work on at least 22 other factory sites with ties to South Korea has also been halted, reported The Korean Economic Daily. Those facilities are involved in industries related to automobiles, shipbuilding, steel, and electrical equipment.

South Korean companies with U.S. business interests have canceled travel plans and recalled their U.S.-based staff, fearing that their employees could be affected by more raids.

“Korean workers are being treated like criminals for building factories that Washington itself lobbied for,” a company executive in Seoul told the business newspaper. “If this continues, investment in the U.S. could be reconsidered.”

President Donald Trump defended the raid, claiming Friday that the employees were in the U.S. “illegally” and that U.S. companies needed to focus on training their American employees in order to do the jobs they would otherwise outsource.

An immigration attorney representing several of the detained South Koreans, Charles Kuck, told the Associated Press that the president’s statement wasn’t just wrong—as many of the workers were authorized to work under the B-1 business visitor visa program—but was basically unfeasible in the short term, as no U.S. companies make the machines utilized at the Georgia factory.

“They had to come from abroad to install or repair equipment on-site—work that would take about three to five years to train someone in the U.S. to do,” the AP reported.

Republicans in both bodies have sought to avoid a politically precarious vote on the Epstein files. President Trump has dismissed concerns over the Epstein files as a “Democratic hoax” and urged his right-wing supporters to move on, but his administration’s handling of the issue has inflamed many in the right-wing base.

Though lawmakers hoped the issue would die down over their August recess, it was revived this week when a key House committee released a note and sexually suggestive drawing addressed to Mr. Epstein that contained what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s signature.

Mr. Schumer proposed his Epstein measure as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill and then, using a maneuver available to him as the minority leader, teed up a procedural vote.

“If Republicans vote no, you’ll be saying to the American people that they should not see the Epstein files,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “I ask my Republican colleagues: After all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, why won’t you vote yes?”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, told reporters that Mr. Schumer’s measure was a “stunt” and promised to dispense with it. The Senate voted 51 to 49 to table it.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she opposed Mr. Schumer’s measure because it was unrelated to the attached defense bill. “It does not belong on the Department of Defense policy bill,” she said.

Mr. Schumer was not the first Democrat to try to force the Epstein issue through the Senate. But other efforts, including two from Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona and one from Jeff Merkley of Oregon, used different procedures that allowed them to be defeated without Republicans recording votes.

Mr. Schumer’s proposal was similar to a bipartisan resolution introduced in the House by Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ro Khanna of California. The pair appear within weeks of being able to force a vote on their measure on the House floor, a move that would require the signatures of 218 House members on what is known as a discharge petition.

Their effort got a boost on Wednesday night, when Representative James Walkinshaw, Democrat of Virginia, was sworn in after winning a special election. Mr. Walkinshaw has vowed to sign the petition, which would bring the number of signatories to 217.

“Given the large amount of sensitive data under S.S.A.’s control, I consider the protection and security” of the information “to be a matter of first importance,” Mr. Crapo wrote.

The letter signaled that Republicans were examining the allegations made by Mr. Borges. He sat down last week with Republican and Democratic staff members of the Finance Committee, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session.

In his whistle-blower complaint, Mr. Borges said that members of the Department of Government Efficiency had uploaded a copy of a crucial Social Security database to a vulnerable cloud server. The database contained records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government, in addition to names, addresses and other details that could be used to steal identities.

Mr. Borges said that DOGE had bypassed the “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data, putting it at risk of being leaked or hacked.

Mr. Crapo’s letter was addressed to Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration. It asked him for information about how the agency had responded to Mr. Borges’s concerns, and whether it had followed normal risk-assessment protocols in allowing DOGE to copy the data to the server. The agency was asked to respond by Sept. 23.

Andrea Meza, an attorney at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower group representing Mr. Borges, said in a statement that she welcomed Mr. Crapo’s letter as an “initial step.”

But she said it did not go far enough in seeking answers about the specifics of Mr. Borges’s complaint. She pointed out that Mr. Crapo was not seeking documents from the agency.

“Later this week, we will provide Congress with a recommended list of records to request that would offer far more insight than any self-assessment by the agency accused of wrongdoing,” Ms. Meza said. “If everything was proper, those documents reviewed by an independent investigator will show it.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint, which was first reported by The New York Times, did not indicate that the server set up by DOGE had been breached. A Social Security Administration spokesman said that the agency was not “aware of any compromise” to the database and that it was “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

Mr. Borges resigned three days after submitting his complaint, saying the agency had made it “impossible” for him to perform his duties “legally and ethically.”

Democrats on the Finance Committee this week called for Mr. Crapo to hold a hearing about Mr. Borges’s allegations and the broader state of Social Security. The agency was thrown into turmoil by Elon Musk, then the leader of DOGE, and his team of young software engineers, who advanced false claims of widespread fraud as they sought extraordinary power over closely guarded data.

Taylor Harvey, a spokesman for the Democratic members of the committee, said Mr. Crapo had not yet responded to their request for a hearing.

The admission came after lawyers representing the children produced a report by the Guatemalan attorney general’s office that included interviews with 115 parents refuting the idea.

The hearing on Wednesday came in a case initially focused on more than 600 Guatemalan children who had entered the United States without a parent or guardian. The Trump administration had planned to hastily repatriate dozens of them on flights over the Labor Day weekend.

During an emergency hearing to stop the planes on Aug. 31, lawyers representing the children told Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, a Biden appointee who received the case during the holiday, that many feared for their safety in Guatemala and were doing everything possible to stay in the United States.

Many of the children, their lawyers argued, were loaded onto planes despite pending immigration proceedings and without any chance to challenge the repatriation. The children have been in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement.

During the Labor Day weekend emergency hearing, the Justice Department insisted the government was working with Guatemalan authorities to reunite families that had been torn apart, and acting on the wishes of the parents.

“The United States government is trying to facilitate the return of these children to their parents or guardians, from whom they have been separated,” said Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government.

Senior Trump administration officials echoed those claims.

Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Trump and the architect of his immigration policy, said on social media last week that the children had been “orphaned” and, after Judge Sooknanan’s ruling, that “a Democrat judge is refusing to let them reunify with their parents.”

During the hearing on Wednesday, Judge Timothy R. Kelly, a Trump appointee who has now been assigned to formally oversee the case, grilled a Justice Department attorney about the Guatemalan attorney general’s report.

The report cited 115 relatives contacted by Guatemalan officials who uniformly disputed that they had requested the return of their children. It mentioned one group of 50 parents who said they would welcome their children home but had hoped to see them stay in the United States. Another 59 rejected, “sometimes in an intimidating manner,” officials’ attempts to reach them, the report said, because they believed their children had been cleared to remain in the United States and refused to encourage their repatriation.

“It should be noted that in one of the reports, the parents stated that if their daughter were to return, they would do everything possible to get her out of the country again, because she had received death threats and therefore could not live in this country,” the report stated.

In sworn declarations filed in the case, several Guatemalan children said they faced neglect, violence at the hands of gangs or racial discrimination and wished to remain in relative safety in the United States.

Judge Kelly noted on Wednesday that the Guatemalan government had been unable to locate a “huge chunk” of the parents, and among those they did locate, none had requested that their children be returned. “So I guess my first question is, you don’t contest what that report lays out?” he asked the Justice Department lawyers.

Sarah Welch, a Justice Department lawyer, told Judge Kelly that the government had no better information than what was contained in the report and therefore would withdraw its claim that families of the children had requested their return.

“I don’t have anything specific that I can refer to to contest the Guatemalan A.G.’s report, so that’s ‘no’ to that question at this point,” Ms. Welch said.

Lawyers for the children asked Judge Kelly on Wednesday to create a class encompassing children of other nationalities, whom they argued the Trump administration had similar plans to repatriate. In their lawsuit, the lawyers representing the children said they had evidence that the agreement with Guatemala was a “pilot program” that the government hoped to replicate with other countries.

The lawyers also asked for a temporary halt on deportations of any unaccompanied children in a similar position until the court could address the legality of the plan.

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment about the government’s position, referring questions to the State Department.

In a news conference after the hearing, Efrén Olivares, a vice president at the National Immigration Law Center, said the government had shown it would do whatever necessary to expel migrants, even in cases involving children.

“That is remarkable to me,” he said. “The government keeps changing their story.”

Rather, in rejecting South Carolina’s request to bar the student from the boys’ bathroom for now, the order said the state had not cleared the high bar for securing an emergency ruling in its favor.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch noted dissents but did not offer reasons.

The state’s lawyers told the justices that the challenged law was “supported by recent actions of the current presidential administration,” including orders signed by President Trump putting federal funding at risk if schools do not designate bathrooms for use based on biological sex.

Alexandra Brodsky, a lawyer with Public Justice, a legal advocacy group that represents the student, welcomed the ruling.

“Today’s decision from the Supreme Court reaffirms what we all know to be true: Contrary to South Carolina’s insistence, trans students are not emergencies,” she said in a statement. “They are not threats.”

Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general, said the ruling was a temporary and limited setback.

“While we are disappointed in the court’s decision today, we respect the process and will comply with the ruling,” he said in a statement. “This ruling only creates an exception for one student. The state’s bathroom law remains in full effect for everyone else. We may have lost this battle, but we believe we will ultimately win the war.”

The Supreme Court has addressed transgender rights in other contexts, ruling in 2020 that a federal civil rights law protects transgender workers while upholding in June a Tennessee law prohibiting some medical treatments for transgender youth. In the term that starts next month, the court will consider two cases testing the constitutionality of state laws that bar transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams.

The South Carolina case involves a 14-year-old student, identified in court papers as John Doe. He challenged the state’s bathroom law, first adopted in 2024, saying it violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause and Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programs that receive federal money.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit last month ordered school officials to let the student use the boys’ bathroom while the litigation is pending, saying that one of its precedents required it.

“Doe is a 14-year-old student who simply wishes to use the restroom,” Judge Albert Diaz, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote in a concurring opinion. “Doing so is a biological necessity. Doing so in restrooms that match his gender identity is his right under our precedent.”

In a second concurring opinion, Judge G. Steven Agee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote that he believed the appeals court’s precedent was wrong but binding. “One can only hope,” he wrote, quoting an earlier opinion, “that the Supreme Court will take the opportunity with all deliberate speed to resolve these questions of national importance.”

In that 2020 precedent, Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, the appeals court ruled that a Virginia school had violated the Constitution and Title IX when it refused to allow Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy, to use the boys’ restroom. The Supreme Court in 2021 refused to hear the state’s appeal, over the dissents of Justices Thomas and Alito.

In the South Carolina case, lawyers for the state filed an emergency application urging the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the legal landscape had changed with its decision in June in United States v. Skrmetti, which upheld a Tennessee law banning some medical treatments for transgender minors.

The South Carolina law, the application said, represents a “considered judgment about the harms of allowing male students to use female restrooms and vice versa.”

“After much debate,"" it went on, “lawmakers chose to protect privacy and safety for students. The Fourth Circuit ignored the people’s judgment and failed to defer to the public interest in favor of the preferences of one student.”

In response, lawyers for the student wrote that the Supreme Court had better things to do with its time than rule on a case affecting a single ninth-grade child.

When the Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in favor of transgender rights in the workplace, Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the ruling was limited.

“We do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms or anything else of the kind,” he wrote then.

If finalized, the proposal would advance what President Trump has termed his “drill, baby, drill” agenda. It also would herald a major shift in the management of roughly 245 million acres of public lands, which make up about one-tenth of the country.

“The previous administration’s Public Lands Rule had the potential to block access to hundreds of thousands of acres of multiple-use land — preventing energy and mineral production, timber management, grazing and recreation across the West,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement on Wednesday.

Repealing the rule, Mr. Burgum said, “protects our American way of life and gives our communities a voice in the land that they depend on.”

The Bureau of Land Management, sometimes called the nation’s largest landlord, has for decades offered leases for the development of public lands, including for oil drilling and cattle ranching. But some of these activities have fragmented and destroyed critical habitat for wildlife. At the same time, climate change has fueled more frequent and more severe wildfires and drought across the American West.

The Biden-era rule, which was finalized in April 2024, sought to put conservation on equal footing with development for the first time since the Bureau of Land Management was established in 1946. It allowed the agency to offer two new types of leases for the restoration of degraded lands and for offsetting environmental damage.

Several Republican-led states and industry groups assailed the rule as a land grab and challenged it in federal court. On Wednesday, they applauded the Trump administration’s proposal to scrap the regulation.

“The Biden administration unlawfully placed conservation above all else,” Rich Nolan, the president and chief executive of the National Mining Association, said in a statement. “This new rule reinstates the balance of federal land use intended by Congress, ensuring that our vast resources can meet today’s soaring energy needs and become the secure mineral supply chains for American industry.”

Conservation groups sharply criticized the announcement, which came as Mr. Burgum spoke at Gastech, an energy industry conference in Milan.

“If Secretary Burgum spent more time in the West, he’d understand how conservation fits into everything the Bureau of Land Management does,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement.

“Hunters, anglers, hikers and backpackers all praised the public lands rule because it helps ensure access to public lands for future generations,” Ms. Rokala said. “Public lands management is a balancing act, and you just tipped the scales back to the 19th century, when robber barons ran the country, exploiting our lands for personal gain.”

In Milan, Mr. Burgum alluded to “deals that are being signed” with other countries to purchase more liquefied natural gas from the United States. He also declared that artificial intelligence was a more pressing concern than global warming.

“What’s going to save the planet is winning the A.I. arms race,” he said. “We need power to do that and we need it now.”

Mr. Trump in February nominated Kathleen Sgamma, then the head of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas industry trade group, to lead the Bureau of Land Management. But Ms. Sgamma abruptly withdrew her nomination in April, just as her confirmation hearing was about to begin.

Trump administration officials asked Ms. Sgamma to withdraw after learning of a 2021 letter in which she criticized the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by a pro-Trump mob, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Mr. Trump has yet to nominate a new candidate to lead the bureau.

The inspector general’s office announced the review in a memo addressed to the statistics agency’s acting commissioner, William J. Wiatrowski, a longtime civil servant. The memo cites the agency’s cutting back on its collection of data related to inflation statistics, as well as recent large downward revisions to jobs figures.

The assistant inspector general who sent the letter, Laura Nicolosi, was appointed to that position in early January, before Mr. Trump took office and fired the Labor Department’s inspector general. The acting deputy inspector general is now serving as the agency’s top official.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has long acknowledged that falling survey response rates and other trends have made it harder to measure the state of the U.S. economy. But experts inside and outside the agency say its efforts to address those challenges have been stymied by a lack of resources. Mr. Trump’s proposed budget would make further cuts.

On Tuesday, the agency said employers had added close to one million fewer jobs in late 2024 and early 2025 than previously reported. That followed a series of unusually large downward adjustments to monthly employment figures.

Big revisions are more common during turning points in the labor market, including when the economy is tipping into a recession. Businesses that take a few months to respond to the surveys are sometimes the ones having the most trouble. But on the whole, revisions have gotten smaller over time.

The report could add heft to the White House’s efforts to get Mr. Antoni confirmed. Mr. Antoni, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, has long been critical of the agency’s output, including on a podcast that aired shortly before his nomination was announced. In it, Mr. Antoni levied several vague criticisms of the bureau’s survey collection methodology and data analysis.

“I think you really need a complete overhaul at the B.L.S.,” he said. “You need to take a long hard look at the models that they’re using, and make sure things are actually modeled to reflect reality today, not just a time in the past.”

Ms. McEntarfer has continued to defend the agency’s work in posts on social media since her firing.

“The big story here is of an agency of dedicated statisticians and public servants working tirelessly to improve economic data in a climate of budgetary cuts to data collection,” she wrote on Tuesday. “They have been very innovative in meeting that mandate. But we should also just fund our economic infrastructure.”

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is expected to hold a hearing on Mr. Antoni’s nomination in the coming weeks. Economists from across the political spectrum have panned the choice, noting several instances in which he appeared to misunderstand the nature of the statistics he would oversee.

Mr. Miran’s journey to join the Fed has been unusual from the start.

He was tapped to fill what could be one of the shortest stints on the Board of Governors after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from the Fed last month. He has moved through the confirmation process at warp speed as Republican lawmakers try to get him seated ahead of the Fed’s vote on interest rates next week. And he has been nominated against the backdrop of an all-out push by President Trump to remake the central bank’s top ranks after months of withering attacks.

But perhaps the biggest break with tradition involves Mr. Miran’s stated plans to remain tied to the White House while he serves at the Fed. Rather than resign his post advising the president on economic policy as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Miran said, he would instead take a unpaid leave of absence. That would enable him to return to the administration once his term at the central bank was complete.

The arrangement has raised the specter that Mr. Miran may feel beholden to Mr. Trump and unwilling to support policy actions that, while good for the economy, would be politically problematic for the president who employs him. Some former White House officials, legal experts, economists and Democratic lawmakers warned that confirming Mr. Miran under these circumstances could set a dangerous precedent undermining the Fed’s longstanding independence.

“It’s obviously inappropriate and very concerning in terms of his ability to operate independently,” said Glenn Hubbard, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers — the same post held by Mr. Miran — during the George W. Bush administration.

The vote is a win for the White House, which was dealt a blow late Tuesday in its efforts to oust Lisa Cook, a Fed governor who has been accused by the president of committing mortgage fraud despite never having been charged or convicted of a crime.

A federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from removing Ms. Cook while she contests her recent dismissal, allowing her to stay on as an active governor in the interim. In her ruling, Judge Jia Cobb said that the president had not established sufficient cause to remove a Fed official, a threshold that she interpreted to mean conduct that occurred while in office and related to the duties of the job.

The Trump administration on Wednesday signaled it would appeal that ruling, suggesting this will be the first step in what could become a drawn-out legal battle. If Ms. Cook loses, Mr. Trump will have yet another opportunity to add more policymakers partial to his point of view to the Fed.

“Donald Trump is full speed ahead in trying to take over the Fed,” warned Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat from Massachusetts, in an interview Wednesday.

The White House declined repeatedly this week to answer specific questions about Mr. Miran’s planned leave of absence from the White House, fanning fears that he will remain closely tied to the administration throughout his tenure at the Fed. “Based on legal guidance, if confirmed, Stephen Miran may take an unpaid leave of absence from his C.E.A. position,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.

But Mr. Miran offered a few new details about his planned leave in correspondence with Ms. Warren which she released ahead of his confirmation vote.

If he is confirmed by the full Senate, Mr. Miran’s term with the Fed will last until January, though he could remain in that role until Mr. Trump secured a successor. Asked if he would commit to resigning once the term expired, Mr. Miran said “no,” signaling to the senator that he would not automatically depart.

The comment suggested that Mr. Miran was open to his term’s lasting longer than four months, since it could take time for the president to identify a new governor, or Mr. Miran himself could be considered for other positions within the central bank.

But Mr. Miran did tell Ms. Warren that he could “re-evaluate” his leave of absence from the White House in the event of a longer appointment. While on leave, Mr. Miran said, he would not “maintain access” to his White House email, but would continue to consult with the Council of Economic Advisers “to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed.” He did not explicitly agree to disclose any conversations he has with the president beyond what may be required by law.

“That’s not independence; that’s servitude,” Ms. Warren said of the arrangement, adding that Mr. Miran would make decisions “with an eye toward the question of whether Donald Trump will approve or disapprove.”

Mr. Trump has made no secret about his desire to see a more compliant central bank that will acquiesce to his demands to lower borrowing costs. The Fed has kept interest rates steady for months in a bid to keep inflation under control. The president has even bragged that he is on the precipice of clinching a majority of support on the powerful board, which Mr. Miran could be the next to join.

Mr. Trump may have yet another opportunity to appoint a board member if he is successful in ousting Ms. Cook, another governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud. And the president will get to appoint a new Fed chair to replace Jerome H. Powell once his term ends in May.

In his advisory role at the White House, which similarly required Senate confirmation, Mr. Miran has echoed some of the president’s attacks on the Fed. He has also helped to produce favorable economic research for Mr. Trump, particularly to make the case that his punishing global tariffs would not cause prices to rise.

Mr. Miran revealed his intentions to stay on at the White House at a confirmation hearing last week, as he sought to head off questions about his ability to resist the president’s pressure. He said he had “received advice from counsel” that he could retain his post at the Council of Economic Advisers on an unpaid basis, citing the fact that the appointment to the Fed may span only about four months.

By taking a leave of absence, Mr. Miran would essentially preserve his ties to that position, while taking on a critical central banking role affording him a powerful vote over the nation’s economic trajectory. If confirmed, he would be able to influence the debate over interest rates, weigh in on the rules and regulations imposed on Wall Street and set priorities for the staff.

Many congressional Democrats reacted coolly to Mr. Miran’s plans, pointing to the fact that he personally had endorsed the idea of closing the “revolving door” between the Fed and the executive branch.

“You’re going to be an employee of the president of the United States on leave,” warned Senator Jack Reed, Democrat from Rhode Island, during last week’s hearing. He added that Mr. Trump could just call up Mr. Miran and say, “Here, I want you to do this, this and this.”

Mr. Reed said on Wednesday that Democrats on the committee had requested further details from the White House on the legality of the arrangement but had not yet heard back.

“We are still completely uncertain as to his legal status, and his independence, which is critical, as a member of the Federal Reserve board,” Mr. Reed said, pledging that his colleagues would “press further” on the issue.

Some experts also questioned the legality of Mr. Miran’s arrangement, given the strict ethics requirements imposed on Fed governors — who, among other restrictions, must devote their “entire time” to the board and its business.

“It ought to be disqualifying,” said Kathryn Judge, a top law professor at Columbia University who studies financial markets and regulation.

Ms. Judge said the Fed’s founding law does not address “directly” whether someone like Mr. Miran could essentially preserve his position at the White House while serving on the central bank. But she said Congress did not intend that arrangement when it chartered the system and imposed numerous guardrails in 1935.

“Given the thoughtfulness of those design features, it seems clear Congress expected meaningful independence,” Ms. Judge added, warning later that any attempt to compromise the institution could pose “incredible dangers” to the economy.

Lisa Gilbert, a co-president of Public Citizen, a watchdog group, said Mr. Miran’s continued relationship with the White House would be “completely inconsistent” with that vision. She said that was especially true at a moment when Mr. Trump had sought to browbeat the Fed into lowering interest rates.

“The Trump administration has consistently tried to apply pressure to the Fed,” Ms. Gilbert said, adding that “this kind of dual role seems inherently problematic when we already understand the pressure they’re attempting to bring to bear on this independent entity.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/10/multimedia/10trump-news-promo-830pm/10trump-news-epstein-files-hmgq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 20:56:42.370945

The ministry said it was talking with US officials about letting the plane return home with the released workers as soon as possible. But it said the plane cannot depart from the US on Wednesday, as South Korea had hoped, due to an unspecified reason involving the United States authorities.

Before meeting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said that he aimed to bring the workers home as quickly as possible.

A total of 475 workers, more than 300 of them South Koreans, were rounded up in the September 4 raid at the battery factory under construction at Hyundai’s sprawling car plant west of Savannah.

Some were shown being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and waists in a video released by US authorities. Many of the detained workers are employees of subcontractors involved in the project.

The US Department of State did not mention the immigration issue in a readout of Rubio’s meeting with Cho, but it mentioned that Rubio said Washington welcomed South Korean investment and that the two discussed promoting a fair and reciprocal trade partnership.

It said they also discussed expanding “equitable defense burden sharing,” a reference to US calls for Seoul to pay more for the presence of US troops in South Korea.

The workplace raid by the US Homeland Security agency was its largest yet as it pursues its mass deportation agenda.

The Georgia battery plant, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States.

Representatives of Korean companies, including Hyundai Motor and LG, urged their government to negotiate with the US for a new type of visa for Korean professionals and to get clearer visa guidelines to reduce uncertainty and support their businesses in the United States, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

Korean businesses have complained about strict US limits on visas for skilled foreign workers, which they say make it difficult for them to oversee the construction of factories or to train the local workforce.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25253550955253-1-1757522144.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-10 21:56:44.481322

Hamas says its top leadership there was considering a U.S. proposal for a Gaza ceasefire. Though they survived the strike, five lower-ranking members died in the attack. A Qatari security staffer was also killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke after the strike.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “At noon today, I convened the heads of Israel’s security organizations and authorized a surgical precision strike on the terrorist chiefs of Hamas. These are the same terrorists who planned — terrorist chiefs who planned, launched and celebrated the horrific massacres of October 7th.”

Einav Zangauker, the mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, condemned Netanyahu for the attack in Qatar.

Einav Zangauker: “I am trembling with fear. I am trembling with fear. It could be that at this very moment Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has essentially sentenced my Matan to death. Anyone who deliberately chooses to endanger my child’s life is murdering him. Why does the prime minister insist on blowing up every small chance for a deal? Why?”

World leaders condemned the strike, including from France, Germany, Britain and the European Union. Germany’s chancellor called Israel’s attack on Qatar “unacceptable,” adding, “The war must not spread to the entire region.”

The president of the United Arab Emirates arrived in Qatar today. Jordan’s Crown Prince Hussein is also set to visit. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to visit tomorrow.

The White House said that it warned Qatar prior to the attack, but Qatar said it only received notice from the U.S. as its capital was being hit by Israeli strikes. Speaking to reporters yesterday, President Trump said that he was “very unhappy” about Israel’s attack. On social media, Trump wrote, “I view Qatar as a strong ally and friend of the U.S., and feel very badly about the location of the attack.”

Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said yesterday that Qatar’s mediation efforts were central to its identity and that the Israeli attack would not deter its diplomatic role.

Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani: “The Israeli attack that took place today on Qatari soil, we cannot call it anything other than state terrorism practiced by someone like Netanyahu in the context of these systematic policies and his ongoing attempts that have destabilized regional security and stability. It’s simply a clear message to the region as a whole.”

Israel continues to bombard Gaza City, ordering the full evacuation of the city’s residents to the so-called safe zone of al-Mawasi. Around 800,000 Palestinians are already sheltering in al-Mawasi, which Israel has targeted at least 109 times, killing over 2,000 people, according to Gaza’s Government Media Office. Residents in Gaza City say they have no safe place to go.

Mahmoud Ad-Dabbs: “We are attempting to delay death a little longer. We have been displaced approximately 30 times, moving from one death to another, but we are trying to postpone death a little. What is the fault of these children? Why is this happening to this child and that one? O Arabs, Muslims, negotiators, please find a solution for us in any possible manner.”

Al Jazeera is reporting that Israeli attacks have killed 20 Palestinians in Gaza today, including 15 displaced people sheltering in tents west of Gaza City. In the past 24 hours, five more Palestinians have starved to death, including one child.

Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found that members of an anti-Islam biker gang, the Infidels Motorcycle Club, are working in Gaza for UG Solutions, which is providing armed security for the shadowy U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. According to the United Nations, 1,135 Palestinians have been killed seeking food near GHF aid sites.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, members of a militia and a civil society group in the eastern city of Uvira are accusing Congo’s military of opening fire on protesters and killing three people. The protesters were calling for the removal of a new commander posted to the region, General Olivier Gasita, who is accused of backing the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.

Safi Mwale: “I am Congolese, and I want peace. Gasita should leave. He should show us the boat he came on, so we can send him back, because we Congolese want peace.”

The M23 rebel group is among more than 100 militant groups fighting in eastern Congo and has emerged as the strongest adversary of the Congolese government.

In the coming weeks, the Trump administration is likely to hit a milestone of 1,000 participating state and local agencies in at least 40 states. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is aggressively recruiting for this deportation-collaboration program. It is now offering cash to local police in exchange for “locating” our immigrant neighbors, as it attempts to reach a level of deportations never before seen in our nation’s history.

President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to remove 20 million people from the country. That's 5.8 percent of our population. This ambitious project – most visible in the masked deportation squads that are smashing car windows and forcing people into black vans – is likely to grow even more nefarious as ICE leeches on to local police to help it.

How Local Police Become Deportation Assistants

The 287(g) Program is a set of partnerships between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and state and local agencies that effectively turns local officials into ICE agents, authorizing selected officers to identify, arrest, and process certain people for immigration enforcement and ultimately deportation.

Local law enforcement participating in the 287(g) program are redeployed from local public safety matters to be an ICE force multiplier. This could include interrogating anyone they believe to be a noncitizen about their right to be in the country and asking for their citizenship papers. It could mean that local jails continue to hold people – grandparents, caretakers and other long-time residents who lack legal status – beyond when they would otherwise be released after a minor infraction or posting bail until ICE comes to take them away. Local police officers become secretaries for ICE - doing paperwork and helping process people for deportations.

Many law enforcement leaders oppose 287(g) because it is a drain on local resources. It not only wastes police officers’ time, it also has led to costly lawsuits for constitutional rights violations, including wrongly holding US citizens. Numerous studies show that this program hurts public safety. People are less likely to come forward to seek police protection when they know calling 911 could result in their family member or friend being deported.

Record Number of Police Now Working With ICE

At the end of Barack Obama’s administration, there were just 32 participating state and local law enforcement agencies. That leapt to 152 in Trump’s first term, and the administration removed guardrails like expiration dates for participation agreements.

Joe Biden’s administration left the program largely intact, refusing to kick out participating law enforcement agencies with records of racial profiling and anti-immigrant abuse, despite calls from the ACLU and our partners.

Now, in just eight months of the second Trump administration, the number of local agencies opting to act as deportation force multipliers has grown by 600 percent. The program has encroached into states that until now had few or no participating agencies, such as Iowa, Maine, New Mexico, Utah, and West Virginia.

287(g) Program Expands in Dangerous New Ways

Congress first authorized 287(g) in 1996, permitting the federal government to delegate certain federal immigration enforcement responsibilities to designated state and local officers, subject to training and close supervision by federal officials. Now, just as the Trump administration has moved to exploit other long-standing legal authorities, it has gone far beyond what Congress intended and morphed this program into a larger, cannibalizing force, the full implications of which we have yet to see.

In the coming months, we expect ICE to tap local police to join its multi-agency, masked deportation squads across the country. Already, in April, ICE boasted a “first-of-its-kind statewide operation” involving ICE and more than a dozen sheriff’s offices, the state of Florida, the FBI and other federal agencies. Blurring law enforcement agencies into a single, unaccountable deportation force is a recipe for civil rights abuses and government waste.

ICE has also illegally relied on 287(g) to detain people at the notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, a hastily constructed facility in the middle of the Florida Everglades, which is surrounded by alligators, snakes, mosquitos, and swampland. The ACLU and our partners recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of people detained there.

ICE has also penned agreements with state National Guards in Texas, Florida and West Virginia. It has tapped campus police departments and even agencies that are not law enforcement-oriented, like the Florida Department of Lottery Services.

Our Communities Are Fighting Back

We are seeing vocal opposition to agreements under consideration in communities nationwide. At a July meeting in\Utah County, Utah “the vast majority” of public input during a commission meeting on a 287(g) agreement was opposed – citing racial profiling, the risk of unidentified ICE agents, and “religious values of loving their neighbors.” In Miami, Florida, lines of people gathered hours before the meeting and delivered hours passionate public comments against the city joining the program. In Camden, Delaware, the city quietly approved an agreement and then backtracked and withdrew after robust public opposition. This led to the state passing legislation to ban these agreements state-wide.

If local governments choose to participate in the 287(g) program, despite community opposition, they can put limits and oversight on how local law enforcement is supporting federal deportation agents and how this impacts community members.

We expect demands for transparency and accountability to grow in the coming weeks and months – the longer we all witness the violence of the masked deportation squads, the more opposition to them will grow.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/police-ice-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 17:56:58.168109

The CBO found that 290,000 immigrants could be removed through those measures, and an additional 30,000 people could leave the U.S. voluntarily.
It cautioned that its population projections are “highly uncertain,” but estimated that the U.S. will have 367 million people in 2055.
Lower immigration to the U.S. could have implications for the nation's economy and the government's budget.
“Deaths are projected to exceed births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected,” it noted.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's plans for mass deportations and other hardline immigration measures will result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next ten years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday in a report that also projected that the U.S. population will grow more slowly than it had previously projected.

Donald Trump's tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, included roughly $150 billion to ramp up his mass deportation agenda over the next four years. This includes funding for everything from an extension of the United States’ southern border wall to detention centers and thousands of additional law enforcement staff. The CBO found that 290,000 immigrants could be removed through those measures, and an additional 30,000 people could leave the U.S. voluntarily.

Coupled with a lower fertility rate in the U.S., the reduction in immigration means that the CBO's projection of the U.S. population will be 4.5 million people lower by 2035 than the nonpartisan office had projected in January. It cautioned that its population projections are “highly uncertain,” but estimated that the U.S. will have 367 million people in 2055.

Lower immigration to the U.S. could have implications for the nation's economy and the government's budget. The report did not directly address those issues, but it noted that the projected population would have “fewer people ages 25 to 54 — the age group that is most likely to participate in the labor force — than the agency previously projected.”

Democrats in Congress have been warning that mass deportations could harm the U.S. economy and lead to higher prices on groceries and other goods.

In the White House, Trump has said he wants to see a “baby boom” in the U.S. and his administration has bandied about ideas for encouraging Americans to have more children. But the CBO found no indication that would happen.

“Deaths are projected to exceed births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected,” it noted.

“For people that had court [dates] already scheduled, people that had working permits legally issued, people that had pending cases with [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]"" he said in an interview. “We have clients that were actually able to provide ICE — during the raid — with that information that they were our clients, and [ICE] just didn’t care,” Perez said.

During the Tuesday press conference, Sarcone said five face felony federal charges and the 52 others who were detained were ""on their way back to their countries of origin.”

“They waived their rights. They said, ‘We’ll go home,’” Sarcone responded.

However, Perez, whose five other clients do not face felony charges, said they were still in the U.S. as of Tuesday.

One of his clients was removed from the United States and sent back to Guatemala despite having a pending case.

“We have not seen that in 18 years of immigration practice,” Perez said.

Perez said that unless his client was presented with papers and not informed of what they were, the man didn’t waive his right to a hearing. The client has been in the U.S. for 14 years, has three children here and is married to a U.S. citizen. Prior to being detained, the client was required to go to Immigration and Customs Enforcement every month to check in with the agency.

“He just went two weeks ago, and then he gets detained and removed in 48 hours. That’s what is crazy about this,” Perez said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story.

In addition to the lives his clients have built in the U.S., many of them would face violence if they were to return to their home countries.

“We’re talking about people from Venezuela, from Cuba, that if they return, they’re going to be killed, they’re going to be incarcerated or they’ll disappear,” Perez said. “In those countries, we have people that have been fleeing from gang violence, from domestic violence, and if you remove them, you’re going to get them killed.”

Pressure on businesses

Sarcone emphasized that business owners who knowingly hire people without legal status also will face repercussions.

“We will aggressively pursue criminal investigations against those who violate our laws by employing non-citizens without authorization. There will be consequences,” Sarcone said.

However, for employers the process is not that simple when balancing checking paperwork with illegally discriminating against an employee, Perez said.

“Employers would make sure that they have the correct paperwork, that they have the proper authorization, but they cannot go beyond reviewing the I-9 form and making sure that they have a Social Security card as well as a work permit. If you go and ask more questions, they could suddenly be violating the human rights of those individuals,” Perez said.

Finding family members

Family members of those who were detained in Cato, were unable to locate their loved ones for days. Perez said they are not put into the system quick enough for anyone to keep track of them. It’s a process, he said, that can take up to three days.

“If you’re taking the right person, if you’re fingerprinting them right there, why are you not going to provide information to the family, to the people that can actually look online, or even the attorney?” Perez said. “Sometimes we have clients that are lost that we don’t find in the system.”

Perez had one client scheduled to have a hearing Tuesday in Batavia but was instead moved to Tacoma, Wash., forcing him to miss the hearing.

“Those are the types of things that ICE is doing, and all his family is here in Central New York. Why are they going to move them to Washington? So they don’t have access to their family? So they get desperate and sign a self-deport issue then they are just gone?” Perez said.

This type of change is meant to confuse family members and those detained, Perez said.

Spectrum News 1 has followed the story of a man whose fiancée was detained in Cato. Neither are represented by Perez. On Monday evening, the man was told his fiancée would return home with an ankle monitor the next day. However, when he went to Niagara Falls on Tuesday in hopes of getting more answers, he was told she may not get to be released — but rather sent to another facility in the Louisiana.

News10NBC’s crew at the scene on Westminster Road saw a U.S. Border Patrol car and IRS personnel. Our crew also saw apparent roofing contractors working on the house. Protesters say they’re concerned that the agents are targeting those contractors.

We spoke to one woman Katie Tobin who first spotted the agents and made the calls to local advocacy organizations. The woman told us she asked the agents who they were, and she claims they told her they were ICE agents.

“And I was like ‘Are you ICE?’ And they were very polite. They said, ‘Yes we are.’ And I was like, ‘This is Rochester, New York. This is a sanctuary city. Get out! We don’t want you here! This is my neighborhood. I don’t want you here. Go, get out,” said Tobin.

When our crews first got there, about 20 people were there. After awhile, over 50 people were there.

The program director for Western New York Farmworker serving agency Maria Garcia tried to coordinate getting the two workers on the roof into her car. She gave them paperwork earlier to sign for an attorney.

Garcia asked the agents if they had a warrant. After they said no, they agreed to leave, but someone in the crowd slashed their tires, and the crowd blocked their car.

Several advocacy leaders who have spoken to our crew say they were trying to keep the crowd focused on the workers, not the agents. People said they were going to stay until the workers were able to safely leave.

In a statement, the Western New York Farmworker Serving Agency said they responded to “provide interim legal education and to help ensure that the rights of impacted individuals were respected.”

“The Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies was on-site today alongside members of various organizations and community groups during today’s incident involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Westminster Road. Our organization, which serves immigrants, migrants, and farmworkers across the region, responded to provide interim legal education and to help ensure that the rights of impacted individuals were respected.

Today, our staff stood alongside community members to ensure that due process was upheld and that constitutional and legal protections were respected. In this difficult and distressing moment, they remained present to share vital information, and connect impacted individuals with their families and critical resources.

As an agency, our focus is on the well-being and safety of our clients. We remain committed to carrying out our work in a lawful, transparent manner that prioritizes the rights, safety, and dignity of those we serve.

‘The Coalition is committed to standing alongside farmworkers, immigrants, and migrants to ensure dignity, fairness, and access to justice,’ said Irene Sanchez, Executive Director. ‘In moments like this, our role is to make sure people know their rights and to safeguard their due process under the law.’

The Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies reaffirms its commitment to the immigrant, migrant, and farmworker community and will continue to respond to emergent situations where constitutional protections and human dignity are at risk.”

Our crew saw people chanting and holding signs at the scene.

Senator Jeremy Cooney says in a statement that he stands with the protestors.

“Rochester, NY, is not Washington, DC! I am proud of the way our local community came together today to protect our neighbors and protest the presence of Customs and Border Patrol agents on Westminster Road. We showed up to make it clear that Rochester will not stand by idly as the federal government commences its abhorrent immigration witch hunt in our communities.”

Congresswoman Claudia Tenney posted on X, saying:

Monroe County Republican Committee Chair Patrick Reilly released a statement, condemning what he calls officials cheering on vandalism and bullying law enforcement:

“The behavior of the mob that bullied the ICE agents in Rochester today, who were just doing their job to uphold the rule of law, is completely disgusting. The fact that elected Democrat Party officials came out to cheer on the vandalism and the bullying of our law enforcement officers shows you everything that is wrong with New York State one-party rule. I, along with my fellow Republicans, pray that President Donald Trump and ICE Director Tom Homan will send in reinforcements to return our city to the greatness it once held.”",https://www.whec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/East-Ave-scene-1024x573.png,N,,2025-09-10 21:57:24.498092

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?” he said in a statement.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for President Donald Trump’s administration at the high court.

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The court’s 6-3 decision followed a pattern of at least temporarily allowing some of the Republican administration’s harshest policies, while leaving room for the possibility of a different outcome after the legal case plays out fully. The net effect, meanwhile, has Trump pushing ahead in many of the areas he considers most critical.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court’s emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning. “The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,” he wrote in a concurrence.

Dissent Says Constitutional Freedoms Threatened

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” she wrote. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges.

The Supreme Court’s decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington as part of Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California, with a hearing set for Sept. 24. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that ICE agents can use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop.

More Than 5,000 Arrests Made

The Department of Homeland Security said last week that authorities had made 5,210 immigration arrests since June 6 and praised the work of its lead commander there, Gregory Bovino, whose “success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.”

The agency promised in an online post to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles” after the high court’s decision.

The region has been top priority for the Trump administration, and its hard-line immigration strategy has spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines.

The number of raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store as the administration carries out the president’s goal of mass deportations.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and border czar Tom Homan both separately applauded the ruling. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” Bondi wrote in a social media post.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It had covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

‘I Was Born Here In The States’

The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops that do not align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Supreme Court decision will fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities. “The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents and pressed against a metal fence with his arm twisted behind his back as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

A terrified Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.

Democratic leaders in California condemned the decision. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she has directed city departments to follow rules barring the use of municipal resources on federal immigration enforcement. “This isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles. This is an attack on every person in this city, and in every city in this country,” Bass told reporters.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can’t be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,” he said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a vocal Trump opponent, said the order would allow agents wide latitude to make stops “including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses.”

Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant.

“I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?” he said in a statement. “That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

The Trump administration has been using four criteria to see who ICE agents can stop for immigration inquiries. They include apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent.

A Sept. 8 Supreme Court decision gives permission to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to continue sweeps in the Los Angeles area that critics and federal judges said amounted to racial profiling.

The limited-scope decision came down in an unsigned, emergency action that did not disclose which justices voted to side with President Donald Trump’s administration and offered no reasoning. But it nonetheless temporarily overturned decisions from the lower courts that blocked ICE from making stops based only on race, language, location and occupation.

All that is known about the justices’ views is that conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh largely agreed with the decision, and three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Kentanji Brown Jackson — disagreed.

Here’s what to know about the decision.

Latino US citizens said ICE ambushed them in the streets

The case, Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, started when a group of Latino residents from California and related workers’ organizations sued the government, saying they were being subject to illegal stops as part of an enforcement blitz that started June 5 in the Los Angeles area.

In one case, a U.S. citizen born and raised in east LA said he was standing on a sidewalk when agents ran toward him with handguns and military-style rifles and repeatedly asked if he was an American. Despite saying he was, they pressed him to say what hospital he was born in, the lawsuit says, but he did not know.

The agents pushed him against a metal fence, put his hands behind his back and twisted his arm, according to the lawsuit. The man eventually produced his Real ID, a type of special drivers license that requires someone to show proof of legal residence. According to the lawsuit, agents took his Real ID and his phone, returning his phone minutes later but never returning his ID.

The Trump administration has a four-part test for immigration stops

The Trump administration has been using four criteria to see who ICE agents can stop for immigration inquiries, according to court documents. They are: (1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location such as a carwash or day laborer pickup site; and (4) the type of work the person does.

The people who sued the administration argued that it was illegal for the administration to solely use these criteria. The Trump administration wrote in a court filing that the people suing and the courts themselves acknowledge that “ICE at least sometimes relies on additional factors.”

Two federal courts sided with the people who were stopped

A trial court in California called ICE's practices an officially sanctioned “pattern of conduct” and said that even though there was no evidence of an “official policy” for these four criteria, immigration agents were routinely using them to make stops. The court barred the administration from relying solely on the criteria to make stops in the Los Angeles area and required ICE to use a higher legal standard called ""reasonable suspicion"" to conduct stops.

The Trump administration appealed, and an appeals court agreed with the lower court. But the Trump administration then appealed to the Supreme Court for an emergency ruling, essentially saying law enforcement were being prohibited from doing their jobs.

The Supreme Court’s limited decision, which came Sept. 8, lets ICE return to using the four criteria in the Los Angeles area, at least during the current stage in the legal process.

In a blistering dissent, Sotomayor, a liberal justice, called the decision a ""grave misuse"" of the court's emergency power. ""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low-wage job,"" she wrote.

Legal technicalities could’ve played a role

The Trump administration argued that the people who sued them didn’t have the right to do so, an issue that can get a case thrown out. The administration wrote that the people’s allegations were “entirely speculative” and that they offered nothing to prove their premise that they could be stopped again by ICE.

The justices who sided with the Trump administration in the one-paragraph decision did not address this issue, so Americans don’t know if the justices sided with the administration based solely on this technicality. However, in his own opinion that only represented his view, Kavanaugh agreed with the Trump administration.

“Plaintiffs have no good basis to believe that law enforcement will stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors — and certainly no good basis for believing that any stop of the plaintiffs is imminent,” Kavanaugh wrote.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/USAT/86074098007-20250909-t-214742-z-796904463-rc-2-hogahzjq-9-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=4555,2562,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-10 16:56:44.242409

Rather, in rejecting South Carolina’s request to bar the student from the boys’ bathroom for now, the order said the state had not cleared the high bar for securing an emergency ruling in its favor.

Zachary S. Price is a Professor at the University of California College of Law, San Francisco (formerly UC Hastings).","The Trump administration’s long-running effort to cancel certain foreign aid is back on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. In Trump v. Global Health Council, the government is seeking to stay an injunction that requires it to obligate some $10.5 billion in aid money before the money expires at the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Although it presents many other issues, the case’s posture—challenging a refusal to obligate funds that expire in twenty-one days (and counting)—highlights a potential mootness question looming over current appropriations litigation, as well as some virtues and vices of the Court’s past emergency rulings.

Consider first the Court’s ruling two weeks ago in National Institutions of Health v. American Public Health Association. In that case, in a split ruling joined in full only by Justice Barrett, the Court held that challenges to the termination of certain medical research grants belong in the Court of Federal Claims rather federal district courts. At the same time, in the other half of its split decision, the Court allowed a challenge to the agency’s overall grant-making guidance to proceed in federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act.

This outcome depended on the interaction of two statutes. On the one hand, the APA allows suits challenging final agency action, but it only permits remedies other than money damages, and it does not apply if another statute “expressly or impliedly forbids the relief” in question. On the other hand, a nineteenth-century statute called the Tucker Act gives the CFC jurisdiction to award damages based on breaches of an “express or implied contract with the United States” or violations of statutes or constitutional provisions that mandate payment.

In yet another emergency-docket ruling back in April, the Court suggested that some spending claims belong in the CFC. In that case, Department of Education v. California, the Court stayed an order that “enjoin[ed] the Government from terminating various education-related grants” and “also require[d] the Government to pay out past-due grant obligations and to continue paying obligations as they accrue.” The Court held, with scant analysis, that claims for such relief “likely” belonged in the Court of Federal Claims.

In NIH v. APHA, the Court doubled down on that suggestion. In a concurrence, two justices even scolded the district court for “defy[ing]” the Supreme Court by failing to “follow [the Court’s] direction” in DOE v. California that claims seeking payment of grant obligations “do not belong in district court.”

Whether or not the Court’s ruling was sound, splitting apart different aspects of the spending challenges will complicate litigating them, and Justice Jackson wrote a fiery dissent in NIH accusing the majority of playing a form of “Calvinball” in which “this Administration always wins.”

There is, however, one potential silver lining for the challengers: For at least some claims, the DOE and NIH rulings could actually help guarantee eventual resolution of key issues. That is so because the government might well argue in a few weeks that the end of the fiscal year has rendered district court litigation moot with respect to any expired funding.

This argument should not necessarily succeed. Lower courts including the D.C. Circuit have long held that, if challengers sue while funds remain available, the court may preserve the status quo with a preliminary injunction extending unobligated budget authority past the end of the fiscal year. A statute, moreover, seems to validate this authority by providing that “[a] provision of law requiring that the balance of an appropriation or fund be returned to the general fund of the Treasury at the end of a definite period does not affect the status of lawsuits or rights of action involving the right to an amount payable from the balance.” Alternatively, challengers might argue that they have a live claim for declaratory relief or some other remedy even if they can no longer get paid. Given the administration’s zeal for asserting executive authority over spending, perhaps spending irregularities can fit within the mootness exception for wrongs “capable of repetition yet evading review.”

The Supreme Court, however, has not squarely addressed this issue, let alone explained how any equitable power to extend budget authority should apply in the current cases. This issue is just one of many now-urgent questions that Matt Lawrence, Eloise Passachoff, and I identified as unsettled in our essay on “Appropriations Presidentialism” (though I should say that I am writing here only for myself and not necessarily for my coauthors).

That brings us to a potential benefit of NIH’s claim-splitting: Whatever the correct answer to the mootness question in other settings, CFC litigation should sidestep it. That is because damages awards from the CFC do not get paid from time-limited appropriations, but instead from a permanent, indefinite appropriation called the Judgment Fund. Accordingly, cases seeking such relief should not become moot when the fiscal year ends; the court can still order payment. Indeed, the whole point of this arrangement is to prevent the government from stiffing people, and a damages remedy here could be quite potent: if nothing else, it would undermine the administration’s claims to have achieved significant cost savings.

To that extent, far from thwarting impoundment litigation, NIH v. APHA may have helped insulate some of it from certain objections. Nevertheless, there are at least two problems.

The first is that CFC litigation itself will raise many questions—questions the Court has given little sign it appreciates. For example, it is not obvious that all grant terminations amount to breach of contract; some might but others might not. In addition, past decisions on Tucker Act jurisdiction are notoriously murky, as evidenced by the disagreements about them in the concurrences and dissents in the Court’s own recent rulings. If CFC litigation is to provide a vehicle for resolving key questions, the Court will have to stick with its apparent view that the CFC has jurisdiction—and not pull the rug out when these issues come back up the appellate ladder.

The second problem is that even a generous understanding of CFC jurisdiction will not permit litigation in that forum of all the current disputes. CFC jurisdiction, again, requires some contractual, statutory, or constitutional entitlement to payment. Accordingly, it will not help in suits like the foreign aid litigation. There, the claim is not that the agency has failed to make required payments, but instead that it has refused to award grants at all.

In such cases, the other side of Justice Barrett’s holding in NIH should help: agency non-spending (assuming it constitutes final agency action) should be reviewable under the APA for the same reasons as the grant-making guidance in NIH. But that point returns us to the mootness question we started with: Once the fiscal year ends, what relief will courts still be able to order?

Though it may not be a focus of the briefing at this stage, this problem is likely to be particularly acute in the foreign aid case. In that case, the administration has not only unlawfully deferred spending over the course of the fiscal year. It has also now claimed that it may exploit those delays to cancel some spending outright.

This theory depends on a peculiar reading of the Impoundment Control Act, a statute generally designed to limit unilateral executive spending cancellations. Although the ICA does not allow the President to cancel spending on his own, it does allow him to propose that Congress do so, and if the President makes such a “rescission” proposal, the statute allows him to delay the spending in question for a forty-five day period. After that period, the statutes makes plain that the administration must release the funds for obligation “unless” Congress has enacted rescission legislation.

Taking advantage of these mechanisms, the administration has proposed rescinding some $4 billion of the foreign aid money at issue in GHC, yet it deliberately did so less than forty-five days before the fiscal year’s end. In a maneuver called a “pocket rescission” (by analogy to the “pocket veto”), the administration believes it can still run out the forty-five day clock on this money and thus allow the funds to expire on their own due to the fiscal year’s end.

This reading of the ICA is perverse. It ignores the statutory language requiring obligation of funds unless Congress rescinds them (something Congress cannot do once funds have expired), and it turns on its head the statute’s evident purpose of constraining non-spending. Yet the administration seems committed to acting on it, and even if it has a change of heart, the administration would likely have difficulty prudently obligating $4 billion in foreign aid in the next three weeks, as the district court’s injunction requires. As a result, litigating the validity of the pocket rescission may well require confronting the question whether courts can extend budget authority beyond its expiration.

In sum, the stay request in GHC seems likely to present, directly or indirectly, a thicket of complex and interwoven questions of judicial, executive, and congressional power, some with potentially large long-run consequences. Courts do not do their best work in such a posture, and the Court’s prior under-reasoned and over-confident rulings do not inspire confidence. These cases ultimately implicate Congress’s power of the purse, an essential legislative check on unilateral executive action, and it would be better if Congress stepped in to defend its own prerogatives. Political blowback actually caused Trump to back down twice from attempted pocket rescissions in his first administration, but this time I’m not holding my breath.

The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn’t hear the commotion outside.
For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances.
High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus.
Lawyers argue Trump’s decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church.","At the start of Trump’s second term, his Republican administration said it would allow immigration arrests at schools — long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent more than 4 million school employees nationwide.

Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student’s father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn’t hear the commotion outside.

Teacher Lauren Fong, who teaches the child whose father was arrested that day, said she was troubled by the decision to confront the father in the school parking lot, which is private property.

“Why a school? Why not someplace else, any place else?” Fong said in an interview. “It was in the parking lot, where it could be witnessed by so many young children.”

The educators are joining a lawsuit filed in April by an Oregon farmworker union and a group of churches, challenging the Trump administration’s decision to open houses of worship to immigration enforcement as well. The amended lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Eugene, Oregon.

A request for comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances. Homeland Security, according to a 2021 memo, could “accomplish (its) enforcement mission without denying or limiting individuals’ access to needed medical care, children access to their schools, the displaced access to food and shelter, people of faith access to their places of worship.”

A day after Trump took office, the department rescinded the memo and instead urged agents to use “common sense” when operating near schools and churches. In a statement, officials outlined their reasoning behind the move: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”

The lawsuit describes several instances of masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement making arrests in and around school and church grounds. In Los Angeles, masked border patrol officers descended on a car parked next to a high school and ordered a 15-year-old boy with disabilities out at gunpoint while searching for a man with gang ties. They handcuffed him and only released him when they discovered they had the wrong person.

The lawsuit includes testimonials from unnamed teachers who report seeing increased anxiety and decreased participation and attendance from students who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus. A speech pathologist at a California elementary school said immigrant parents were reluctant to sign up their children for special education services because it would mean giving more information to the school. A Texas high school teacher for students learning English said enrollment in her classes has dropped precipitously.

“America’s classrooms must be safe and welcoming places of learning and discovery,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said the Trump administration is creating fear and chaos and “our students, schools, and communities are paying the price.”

Leaders in the heavily immigrant churches that sued also described increased anxiety and a drop in Mass attendance.

Lawyers argue Trump’s decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church. Rescinding the sensitive-locations memo, the lawsuit says, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which bars agencies from implementing policies that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”

Is it a Mexican family eating dinner at a table near a taco truck?

Afghan women in hijabs working at a Middle Eastern market?

South Asian girls in colorful lehengas, speaking Hindi at an Indian wedding?

According to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing a concurrence in the Supreme Court’s emergency ruling allowing roving immigration raids in Los Angeles, any of these could be fair game, using law and “common sense.”

Brown people, speaking brown languages, hanging out with other brown people, and doing brown people things like working low-wage jobs now meets the legal standard of “reasonable suspicion” required for immigration stops.

Living while brown has become the new driving while Black.

Of course, this particular high court ruling — and our general angst — has centered on Latino immigrants. That’s fair, and understandable. In California, about half of our immigrants are from Mexico, and thousands more from other Latin and South American countries.

But increasingly, especially for newer immigrants, more folks are coming from Africa and Asian countries such as China and India — some of which, you may recall, Donald Trump called “shithole countries” way back in 2018, while questioning why America doesn’t take more immigrants from white places such as Norway.

It’s a dangerous mistake to think Trump’s immigration purge is just about Latinos. He’s made that clear himself. We have reached the point in our burgeoning white nationalism when our high court has deemed brown synonymous with illegal, regardless of what country that pigment originated in. False distinctions about who is being targeted create divisions at a time when solidarity is our greatest power.

“It’s really about racial subordination, and this is really about promoting white supremacy in this nation,” George Galvis, executive director of Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice, told me. He’s part Native American and part Latino, and 100% against policies like this one that target people by skin color.

Mexico, India, China, Iran. People from these places may not always see what they have in common, but let me help you out.

Racists see two colors: white and not white. Although this particular case was filed on behalf of Latino defendants, there is nothing in it that limits its scope to Latinos.

“It’s not targeting, you know, Eastern Europeans. It’s not targeting people who are Caucasian,” said Amr Shabaik, legal director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in L.A., a nonprofit civil rights organization advocating for American Muslims. “This is going to be on Black and brown communities, and that’s who’s going to feel the brunt.”

For Black Americans, this argument is as old as dirt. Our criminal justice system, our society, has a long and documented history of viewing Black Americans with suspicion — considering it “common sense” to think they’re up to something nefarious for actions like getting behind the wheel of a car. But, for the most part, our courts have frowned upon such obvious racism — though not always.

That anti-Black discrimination can be seen today in Trump’s deployment of the National Guard into urban centers in what Trump has described as a “war” on crime, a callback to the war on drugs of the 1990s that targeted Black Americans with devastating consequences.

This ruling on immigration enforcement goes hand-in-hand with that military deployment, two prongs in a strategy to wear away our outrage and shock at the dismantling of civil rights.

As Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in her dissent, the 4th Amendment is supposed to protect us all from “arbitrary interference” by law enforcement.

“After today,” she wrote, “that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little.”

That makes this ruling “unconscionably irreconcilable” with the Constitution, she wrote.

ICE has detained about 67,000 people across the country since last October, according to government data. Of those, almost 18,000 are from Mexico. Detentions of people from Guatemala and Honduras add almost 14,000 Latinos to that number. Places including Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela add thousands more. Certainly, by any measure, Latinos are bearing the brunt of immigration enforcement.

Other parts of the brown world are not immune, however. More than 2,800 people from India have been detained, as have more than 1,400 Chinese people. Thousands of people from across Africa, including more than 800 Egyptians, have been locked up, too.

So we are not just talking about Latino people at car washes or Home Depots. We are talking about Artesia’s Little India; Mid-City’s Little Ethiopia; the Sri Lankan community in West Covina.

We are talking about Sacramento’s Stockton Boulevard, where Vietnamese men congregate in the cafes every afternoon.

We are talking about the farms, schools and towns of the Central Valley and the Central Coast, where Latino and Asian immigrants grow our food.

We are talking about cities such as Fremont in the Bay Area, where 50% of the population is Asian, from places including India, China and the Philippines.

We are talking about California, where immigrants make up 27% of the state’s population, more than double the national average. And yes, many of them lack documents, or live in families of mixed status.

A recent UC Merced study found that there are about 2.2 million undocumented immigrants in California. Of those, about two-thirds have been here more than a decade, and half have been here for more than 20 years.

“This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws — it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses,” Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media. “Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family — and every person is now a target.”

Remember a few short months ago when our dear leader swore they were only going after criminals? How quickly did that morph into criminals being anyone who had crossed the border illegally?

And now, it has openly become anyone who is brown — and we are not even shocked. We are happily debating what the rules of these broad sweeps will be, having given up entirely on the fact that broad sweeps are horrific.

Do you think it will stop with immigration, or even crime? What about LGBTQ+ people? Or protesters? Who becomes the next threat?

Immigration sweeps are not a Latino problem, a Latino fear. We have opened the door to target people who “common sense” tells us are un-American.

The only way to close that door is with our collective strength, undivided by the kind of “common sense” discrimination that men like Kavanaugh embrace.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07ece73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4241x2227+0+405/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F54%2F3af29ffc44eb80dbf5385f2cc2b8%2F1518827-me-anti-ice-rally-home-depot-ajs-02.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:57:53.699797

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Dan Goldman led 23 House Democrats in introducing an amendment to the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would prohibit any federal funds from being used to deploy the National Guard for purposes of immigration enforcement. Goldman’s amendment comes as the Trump administration has stationed Guard units at ICE facilities across the country, including in Washington, D.C. and California, and has threatened to send troops into cities like New York, Chicago, and New Orleans to bolster his anti-immigrant crackdown.

“The use of armed soldiers, often with obscured identities, to patrol American streets and assist in immigration raids is a direct assault on the rule of law and a terrifying step toward turning our military into Trump’s personal police force,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “Congress cannot allow the National Guard to become a weapon for the president to exact vengeance on his opponents and terrorize our communities. My amendment makes clear that our troops cannot be misused for these political stunts, and I urge my colleagues from the ‘party of small government’ to join this commonsense effort.”

In July, the Trump administration authorized the deployment of the National Guard to provide ICE agents with direct protection and security for operations and personnel during immigration enforcement actions, particularly in response to concerns about violence and disorder at protest sites, as well as administrative, clerical, case management, and transportation assistance. The deployments come as the Trump administration has used masked, plainclothes ICE agents to arrest law-abiding immigrants outside immigration courthouses and detain them in inhumane conditions without any oversight from other branches of government.

Congressman Goldman has led House Democrats’ opposition to the Trump administration’s lawless immigration crackdown.

In July, Congressman Goldman and 11 other Members of Congress filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration last month over its continued refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including the 26 Federal Plaza, which is also located in the Congressman’s district.

In August, Congressman Goldman and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led over 50 of their colleagues in demanding an immediate investigation into alarming reports that U.S. citizens are being wrongfully detained and deported by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies. In a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) internal oversight offices, the lawmakers raised urgent concerns about a growing pattern of civil rights violations against U.S. citizens during immigration sweeps.

This summer, Goldman and Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Adriano Espaillat introduced the ‘No Secret Police Act,’ which would require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals and to ban them from using home-made, non-tactical masks.

Last Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from using emergency powers under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to quickly remove members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua from the United States. The ruling marks the latest development in a high-profile legal battle between the administration and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over use of the AEA to remove illegal aliens.

Background

On March 14, President Trump signed a proclamation entitled “Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.” Through the proclamation, the President invoked the AEA to quickly remove members of the newly designated foreign terrorist organization Tren de Aragua. The proclamation held that Tren de Aragua is conducting “irregular warfare against the territory of the United States,” both directly and at the direction of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. It further declared that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of Tren de Aragua in the United States (and not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents) are now subject to the AEA and thus, “liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

The proclamation was then promptly blocked by D.C District Judge James Boasberg in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU. In a brief opinion on April 7, the Supreme Court overturned the district court’s order and held that challenges under the AEA must be brought in the district where an alien is being detained (known as habeas relief).

Following the Supreme Court’s order, the controversy continued in another lawsuit filed on April 16 in the Northern District of Texas, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals. Again, supported by the ACLU, the suit challenged the detention of the two aliens where they were being detained – per the Supreme Court’s ruling – and sought a temporary restraining order blocking removals of any aliens held within the Texas district. District Court Judge James Hendrix denied that order on April 17, deeming it unnecessary as the federal government had agreed to not remove the two aliens while the case was pending. Judge Hendrix’s order left open the option to certify a class of detainees in the district, who, if certified, could then seek an order blocking their removal.

Immediately after the temporary restraining order was blocked, the ACLU filed appeals to both the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent removal of any other individuals in the proposed class. While the Fifth Circuit denied the motion as “premature” in order to give the district court time to act, the Supreme Court entered an unusual early-morning order on April 19 instructing the federal government “not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.” On May 16, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit.

Ruling

Last week, in a 2-1 ruling, the Fifth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction blocking removals under the AEA. According to the court, the Trump administration failed to demonstrate that Tren de Aragua’s activities constituted an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” as required under the AEA. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit held:

A country’s encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States. There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Andrew Oldham asserted that the majority in the case was undermining precedent and understating the threat posed by Tren de Aragua. First, he argued that the majority is “second-guessing” the President, pointing out that courts have never blocked a president’s invocation of the AEA and that historically the Supreme Court has treated a president’s declaration of invasions or incursions as conclusive. Oldham further warned that the threat posed by Tren de Aragua is “hard to overstate,” and cited reports of the gang’s deep infiltration into Venezuelan institutions and its exploitation of the border crisis over the past four years. Judge Oldham wrote in conclusion:

The majority’s approach to this case is not only unprecedented—it is contrary to more than 200 years of precedent. It reflects a view of the Judicial power that is not only muscular—it is herculean. And it reflects a view of the Executive power that is not only diminutive—it is made subservient to the foreign-policy and public-safety hunches of every federal district judge in the country.

Conclusion

Following the decision, the Trump administration pushed back. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson echoed Judge Oldham’s claim that the majority was second-guessing the President: “The authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President. We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case.” The ACLU’s Lee Gelernt meanwhile praised the ruling. “This is a critically important decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

The UWCHR report could be seen as an attempt to finally apply human rights law to the Global North as well.","This article was originally published by Gossip Guy on Sept. 8, 2025.

A new report from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) has reached a startling conclusion: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have forcibly disappeared people in Washington state in at least 16 instances, including 14 individuals and two families, since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.

The center says the two federal agencies in charge of immigration enforcement have crossed a threshold into grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law, engaging in at least two types of international crimes: enforced disappearances and refoulement.

What is an enforced disappearance?

At an Aug. 21 press conference announcing the report, UWCHR director Dr. Angelina Godoy explained that an enforced disappearance consists of several aspects that go beyond a simple detention or arrest.

“To meet the criteria of forced disappearance requires three conditions,” Godoy said. “One, a person taken into custody, typically of the state under some circumstance; maybe a party acting in state-like capacity, but typically of the state, which is what we have here. Two, the state denies access to information about where they are, how they are doing. Families oftentimes don’t know if their loved one is alive or dead, let alone where they may be held at any given time. And third, as a result of that, people are placed outside the protection of the law. They’re held incommunicado in most cases, unable to obtain legal representation, unable to defend their rights legally. That means, of course, that they may then continue to experience other types of grave violations like torture and many other things.”

Godoy argued that in 16 cases the center had identified, detainees had been denied basic rights and due process such as the right to legal representation and to appeal deportations or transfers.

The UWCHR report also outlined a large but unknown number of deportation cases from Washington state in which the act of ""refoulement"" was committed, a legal term used to describe when a refugee or asylum seeker is sent back to the country where they faced political persecution. Refoulement is strictly prohibited by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocal, the latter of which the U.S. is party to. Much of the convention's text has been adopted into U.S. law under the 1980 Refugee Act.

While the concept of “non-refoulement” is established in U.S. law, enforced disappearance has not been recognized by U.S. courts. However, several provisions, such as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, mandate due process to all people detained by the state, regardless of their immigration status. The U.S. has not signed or ratified the 2006 U.N. Convention that prohibits enforced disappearances, which has been adopted by 76 countries. However, the U.S. is a party to the U.N. Convention against torture, upon which the enforced disappearance convention is based.

The allegations of grave human rights and humanitarian law violations by the U.S. are noteworthy as wealthy, historically colonizing nations of Europe, North America and the Anglosphere played an influential role in the development of international law.

This fact, as well as the lack of retroactive application to historical atrocities like the European invasion of the Americas and trans-Atlantic slave trade, has led some scholars from the Global South to accuse international legal institutions of bias. The UWCHR report could be seen as an attempt to finally apply human rights law to the Global North as well.

Families detained for weeks without access to the outside world

Among the 16 cases of enforced disappearance studied by UWCHR researchers, seven involved migrants who were expelled to El Salvador’s CECOT megaprison in violation of a federal court order and six were related to migrants who were transferred to a detention facility at Guantánamo Bay without any access to counsel or information provided to family members. Another of those cases was that of Tuan Thanh Phan, a Vietnamese American who was deported to South Sudan and later transferred to detention at a U.S. military base in Djibouti.

Phan’s case made national news headlines due to the fact he was deported to a likely unsafe third country, thousands of miles away from his home country of Vietnam. In an unsigned June 23 order, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to continue sending immigrants to “third countries.”

Among the most harrowing cases covered in the UWCHR report involve two families who were detained by CBP and held in confinement for weeks without access to legal counsel. A family of six asylum seekers from Africa were apprehended on April 26 and held in a single windowless cell with no bedding or bathing facilities for 24 days in Blaine, Washington, near the U.S.-Canada border. Their youngest kid was only 11 months old and a U.S. citizen, while the mother was in the second trimester of pregnancy during her detention.

A trend of migrant dehumanization

Immigration advocates who spoke at the press conference shared that the new phase of enforced disappearances by ICE and CBP is only the next step in a long process of dehumanization against migrants in the U.S.

Josefina Mora-Cheung, an organizer with the immigration justice group La Resistencia, said that immigrants in Washington state are currently experiencing greater hostility by the Trump administration.

“There’s already a fear among the heightened climate against immigrants already,” Mora-Cheung said. “And for family members to not know that their family members are being detained or deported just puts an immense amount of trauma on our immigrant communities. We know from historical attacks on many different immigrant communities that this leaves not only direct trauma, but intergenerational trauma as well.”

Although Godoy expected human rights conditions of migrants to worsen under the Trump administration, she expressed astonishment over the rapid pace of progression toward graver abuses.

“I never expected, not in my wildest dreams, that through that rigorous process of cross-checking and cross-corroborating, we would come up with 16 cases, or actually it’s 14 individuals and then two families, in just a few months who have experienced forced disappearance in ways connected to the state of Washington,” Godoy said. “That’s an atrocious number. It’s shocking. It defies understanding.”

She added though that even before Trump took office, immigrants had already faced an unacceptable level of deprivations and abuses within the immigration system that had become routine.

“The way we got here, to this place where people are being forcibly disappeared, is by collectively tolerating the daily violation of migrants’ rights in the detention process, in the deportation process — it’s happening every day,” Godoy said. “However, forced disappearances are yet another level of concern.”

Dr. Angélica Cházaro, an immigrant rights advocate and professor at the UW School of Law, said the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, commonly referred to as the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC), is notorious for its poor treatment of migrants. These conditions have led to numerous hunger strikes and protests from detainees.

“It’s both like the devil we know, the Northwest Detention Center and the terrible conditions there that hunger strikers for years have been calling attention to, and new practices of detention and disappearance that the report is pointing to.”

Critics of ICE have also said there’s an increased politicization of the agency, with some alleging that the Trump administration is targeting political dissidents such as Palestinian U.S. permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil. Here in Washington, immigrant rights advocates have accused authorities of targeting Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a farmworker union organizer, for his work opposing the H2A program. Juarez Zeferino returned to Mexico in July after what he described as nearly four months of poor treatment at the NWDC.

More recently, ICE’s Aug. 21 detention of Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, a U.S. veteran and anti-war activist, also raised concerns of political targeting. Chaudhry’s wife, Melissa Chaudhry, ran for congress in 2024 on a left-leaning, pro-Palestine and anti-war platform.

Potential for action by state and local authorities

At the UWCHR press conference, advocates claimed that Washington state and local government officials could take a more assertive approach to stymieing ICE and CBP’s attacks on migrants.

The center’s report revealed for the first time that ICE is now deporting immigrants on commercial flights from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, in addition to King County’s Boeing Field. Cházaro said the Port of Seattle, for example, could take further actions to increase transparency on ICE operations at SeaTac.

“The moment it was clear [Trump] was taking office, that was a moment for every single institution in Washington state to be taking a look at its practices to see how could we [be] or are we complicit in ICE’s practices? And that has not happened,” Cházaro said. “We see that with the Department of Licensing, with them releasing so much information to ICE actively. We see that now with the Port of Seattle, apparently not being aware that our airport in SeaTac is being used for these deportations. Those are the sorts of things that they should have proactively been looking for at the moment that they saw the [arrival of the new] Trump administration, not holding press conferences when they claim to be supportive of immigrants without actually doing the hard work that this group of researchers at UW has done on their own to figure out what those are.

“It shouldn’t take the UW Center for Human Rights spending months of their time to reveal these connections. That is the responsibility of the institutions themselves. And so that to me is part of what’s shocking.”

Cházaro also said that Washington leaders, including Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, have ignored the plight of the small subset of migrants who have been convicted of criminal offenses. She said that people who serve their sentences shouldn’t be punished a second time via deportation.

Washington’s Keep Washington Working Act, the sanctuary law that forbids cooperation between state and local authorities and federal immigration enforcement, has an explicit carve-out that lets the state Department of Corrections transfer immigrants directly to ICE custody after they finish their sentences.

According to Cházaro, Ferguson could have pardoned Phan after he completed his 25-year sentence for first-degree murder and second-degree assault, but before he was deported to South Sudan, which would have prevented immigrant judges from revoking his green card and thus allowed him to stay in the U.S.

“The case we were making was that Governor Ferguson was the one person whose decision could lead to Tuan returning to the U.S. on his green card,” Cházaro said. “And so the fact that he failed to take that action, to me, puts the responsibility on him.”",https://www.realchangenews.org/sites/default/files/p3%20UWCHR_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:57:58.934802

His attorney Ben Cornell said his assault conviction from an argument with his wife years ago was what held him. His wife said it was a misunderstanding and that he never hurt her.

On Tuesday, during the hearing, they had to prove why he couldn't return to Iran as a political and religious asylee.

A message shared by Mountain Dreamers , a Summit County-based immigrant advocacy nonprofit, stated Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents could be planning operations in the county for Thursday, Sept. 11. Another immigrant advocacy nonprofit, Voces Unidas , posted on Facebook Sept. 8 that it had heard a rumor in Summit County about a “possible ICE operation” on Sept. 11. President Alex Sanchez said there was “no evidence” to support the claim.

Executive director Peter Bakken said his group heard over the weekend that federal agents had been looking for a place to stage a law enforcement operation in the county, planning for it to take place Sept. 11.

“This was sometime last week,” Bakken said. “I don’t know what they were planning.”

Mountain Dreamers removed its post and shared another Sept. 8 that stated the Dillon Ranger District offices in Silverthorne “will not be utilized by Federal Migration Agents,” but agents are likely to use another location.

“An organization was spreading a rumor that we already knew about,” Sanchez said. “We chose … not to spread it because we could not verify it independently.”

Sanchez added local authorities did not provide any evidence to support the rumor. He said people talking about it were acting “in good faith,” but “good intentions don’t always turn into good impact.”

“We need to make sure that nonprofits, government officials and elected officials are acting in a responsible manner,” Sanchez said. “We cannot traumatize people more than they already are.”

Voces Unidas’ post stated most local leaders do not know about ICE operations in advance, and although there has been a “surge in federal activity in Colorado” in recent weeks, the organization found no “credible intelligence” that an operation would occur in the county Sept. 11.

Bakken and Sanchez both emphasized the importance for immigrants of being prepared for interactions with immigration agents, regardless of speculation about when operations could occur.

“We need to be able to be resilient for four years, or three-plus more years,” Sanchez said. “We need to figure out how to best work as communities.”

Mountain Dreamers and Voces Unidas both have resources on their websites to help immigrants prepare. Sanchez said Voces Unidas posts daily about any confirmed immigration enforcement activity in Summit and surrounding counties.

Voces Unidas has a hotline for people to report ICE activity or request help for affected families, which is 970-340-8586. It also emphasizes the importance of immigrants knowing their rights.

Sanchez said most of the cases Voces Unidas has dealt with since January where people are detained by ICE have involved people not knowing their rights and offering information.

“The stop turned into a detention turned into a formal arrest, and eventually the proceedings happened,” Sanchez said. “Knowing your rights has been well documented to work.”

Both Voces Unidas and Mountain Dreamers have information about immigrant rights on their websites. For a full list of information on legal rights, visit MountainDreamers.org/knowyourrightsimmigration .

Sanchez also mentioned the importance of “family planning,” encouraging immigrants to think about what they will do if their family members are separated. He said contacting and establishing a relationship with an immigration lawyer before any issues arise can be helpful.

“Discuss about what happens with minors and who can take care of kids in the worst-case scenario,” Sanchez said. “As harsh and as traumatizing this process is, this process is not new to our communities.”

Voces Unidas has resources for making a family plan on its website.

Bakken said Mountain Dreamers has seen an “outpouring of support” for the immigrant community since the weekend.

The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) filed these lawsuits to fight for the civil rights and privacy of Washingtonians, and to protect $14 billion in federal funding that supports vital public services for people across the state. Summaries of these lawsuits, and links to the case dockets are now available.

“This president refuses to follow the Constitution and abide by the rule of law. Fortunately, states like Washington are fighting to ensure our foundational principles and rights are protected,” Brown said. “Whether it’s attacks on workers, students, public safety, the environment, immigrants, or other core pieces of our communities, this office has an excellent team passionate about safeguarding Washingtonians’ rights. Together, we’re working every day to defend Washington law and help get the state through these times.”

Washington’s legal team has secured notable wins, including:

A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling blocking President Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship, which would have harmed thousands of Washington babies each year, and affirming the nationwide scope of the injunction

Full restoration of about $150 million in funding for Washington schools and educational programs that the Trump administration had frozen

An order blocking the president’s illegal actions to “end” gender affirming care to young people through withholding funding to medical institutions and providers who provide such care

Protecting more than $180 million in funding for infrastructure projects that guard against natural disasters, such as levees and earthquake retrofitting

Preserving more than $21 million in funding for AmeriCorps service and volunteer programs in Washington

Restoring more than $71 million in funding for the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure in Washington

The AGO has experienced some setbacks, including in orders issued by the U.S. Supreme Court through the emergency shadow docket, which refers to cases the court considers on an emergency basis without full briefing and oral argument. Decisions made this way are not the final word, and litigation on the core issues of each case continues. Some cases include:

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the federal government, and against Washington and 15 other states, effectively allowing the National Institutes of Health to terminate $783 million in grants that the administration deemed were related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, gender identity, and other topics. We are fighting to ensure these terminated grants are restored to researchers and that future terminations cannot be made based on illegal federal policies.

The high court granted an order that allows the Department of Education to take steps to dismantle itself while the underlying case proceeds. The AGO hopes to brief and argue the issue fully before the court, so that this critical federal agency can be preserved.

For Washington, there are three basic criteria that must be met when filing a federal lawsuit against the executive branch:

Whether the administration’s actions are illegal or unconstitutional,

Whether the actions are harming Washingtonians or entities in the state, and

Whether a lawsuit is necessary to protect Washington’s interests.

Washington state law gives the Attorney General broad authority to sue on behalf of the people of Washington. That means when Washingtonians’ rights are under attack, whether that’s by a company defrauding consumers or by the president of the United States curtailing the civil rights of residents, the office can file a lawsuit and seek justice on their behalf. The Attorney General also serves as chief legal officer for most of state government, and many of the federal lawsuits have been filed on behalf of state agencies harmed by the federal administration’s actions. At this point in time during the first Trump administration, Washington state had filed 13 lawsuits.

While the challenges created by the current president are significant, the work of the AGO encompasses much more than federal litigation. Some of the agency’s many responsibilities include protecting consumers and workers, enforcing antitrust laws against anti-competitive business practices, enforcing state civil rights laws, prosecuting sexually violent predators, protecting the rights of veterans, and safeguarding the environment.

She travelled to the Canada-U.S. border in Niagara Falls, Ont., Sunday to help argue the family's case.
Fearing arrest and deportation to Haiti by ICE, Paulna, her family and her sister, decided to come to Canada where Maxen already lived.
Border agents had taken issue with Paulna's paperwork due to a middle name on her documents that her siblings didn't have.
Maxen was told Paulna and her family were already on their way to ICE detention in Texas.","A Haitian family has been allowed in Canada, following nearly two months in an American immigration detention centre after being turned away by Canadian border agents.

The family had tried to reunite with a brother in Canada in mid-July but were denied entry by Canadian border agents who told them they believed their documents were fraudulent.

The two adults and three children, ages two, eight and 12, were handed over to United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and taken to a detention centre for families in Texas, where they were held until this weekend.

Heather Neufeld, the family's lawyer, says the case is part of a growing trend of Canadian border agents making erroneous decisions that are forcing asylum claimants into the punitive U.S. immigration detention system.

""A wrong decision means someone is sent back to the U.S., to detention in terrible conditions and very likely deportation,"" said Neufeld, who is based in Ottawa. She travelled to the Canada-U.S. border in Niagara Falls, Ont., Sunday to help argue the family's case.

""It's a completely different environment now.""

Neufeld said the fact that the family was let into the country after CBSA redetermined their case with only a few additions to their documents shows the agency appears to be making more wrong decisions in its push to remove an extra 4,000 people from the country by 2027.

CBC News reported the family's story last week, while they were still detained in Texas.

The mother, Paulna, had been trying to reunite with her brother, Maxen, who has been in Canada for 12 years and is now a citizen.

They went to the U.S. last summer under a humanitarian program for people from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti. That program was ended by U.S. President Donald Trump in June, which left more than 500,000 people in the country at risk of deportation.

Fearing arrest and deportation to Haiti by ICE, Paulna, her family and her sister, decided to come to Canada where Maxen already lived. Having a relative here meant they could claim asylum.

CBC News is not publishing surnames of Maxen and his family members because they fear it could jeopardize their immigration case or result in reprisals in Haiti if they are deported.

By the time Maxen arrived to pick up his relatives, CBSA had only allowed the elder sister, who did not want to be identified, to enter Canada and claim asylum. Border agents had taken issue with Paulna's paperwork due to a middle name on her documents that her siblings didn't have.

Maxen was told Paulna and her family were already on their way to ICE detention in Texas.

Over the following months, Maxen struggled to get a picture of the family's conditions in detention.

The family has begun to share details of what happened to them there. He says Edy, Paulna's husband, was hit by ICE guards at the centre and that the air conditioning was so powerful that they were always cold.

The children appeared pale and slightly dishevelled when he finally saw them Sunday night. The next day, he took them to the hairdresser.

""I love them so much,"" he said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7630068.1757523772!/cantoImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/maxen-portraits.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-10 15:58:04.137108

The National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers joined a federal lawsuit Tuesday after the Trump administration took away the directive for immigration officials to stay away from school grounds.

Although no Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officials are known to have entered a school for enforcement, the lawsuit alleges people have been arrested while dropping off students and other parents have pulled students from school or certain activities due to fear of deportation.

The teacher unions point to studies showing enrollment drops or increases in absences after ICE activity has been reported in certain areas.

“Every student who comes into their public school — no matter what they look like or the language they speak — belongs in a safe and welcoming public school so they can learn and grow,” said Becky Pringle, NEA President.

“By targeting schools, Donald Trump’s ICE is creating fear and chaos, and our students, their families and communities are paying the price for these traumatic and extreme immigration actions. We have a professional and moral responsibility to keep our students safe. We will continue to show up for our students and their families, and we will stand up at our schools and communities when they are under attack,” she added.

“We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.”","A rightwing influencer accompanied officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Chicago on Sunday as the agency ramps up arrests in the city. Ice agents arrested four people on the city’s south-west side.

Ben Bergquam, the rightwing internet personality, was with agents, filming and making content as well as getting into altercations with local residents along the way, according to a video the Guardian viewed on X. In the video, he appears to be in the car with Ice agents and nearby as they arrest people; later on he yells at a group of Chicagoans who are gathered to prevent Ice operations that they are “the enemy within”.

Bergquam often travels to migrant shelters and protests, and has even filmed an Ice raid in Chicago previously to prove wrongdoing by those opposed to Donald Trump and his agenda. In a 2024 video he falsely claimed that Hurricane Helene victims wouldn’t be helped out financially because the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), spent all its money housing migrants in Chicago.

Usually based in Fresno, California, Bergquam has been traveling to the Illinois city since at least 2019, according to Block Club Chicago, when he falsely accused a local pastor of being part of a transnational group that guided migrant caravans from Central and South America. He is a part of the same rightwing network, Real America’s Voice News, that hosts shows by Steve Bannon, Charlie Kirk and other far-right figures.

“Ice has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city, which protects them over law-abiding citizens,” the immigration agency told the Guardian, but did not respond to questions about whether it had authorized Bergquam to attend Ice enforcement activities. “We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge Ice resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners from across the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.”

Bergquam did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security posted on X that the agency’s operations on Sunday and Monday in Chicago constituted what it called “Operation Midway Blitz”, with a focus on the predominantly Latino neighborhoods surrounding the Midway airport.

This comes just as the supreme court ruled that Ice can continue its operations in Los Angeles, which were paused because of how the agency was conducting itself and detaining people based on criteria that included “blatant racial profiling”, according to a US district judge.

Trump took aim at Chicago’s sanctuary policies and depicted it as crime-infested On Saturday, he posted to Truth Social: “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” but he walked back that statement on Sunday. His stated plan is to deploy the national guard to the city to combat crime, as he has done in Los Angeles and Washington DC. However, the city’s crime rate over the summer was the lowest in 60 years, according to WBEZ.

Bergquam visited Chicago in January and accompanied the “border czar”, Tom Homan, on Ice raids, and again in April when he stood outside a city shelter that served newly arrived migrants and unhoused Chicagoans, and pointed at women standing outside, calling them “illegals”.

Members of the DHS and White House officials have put together their own sizzle reels to show off Ice operations and used the opportunities to promote their mass deportation plans, with the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, fully glammed up for videos during Ice raids. The DHS, the White House and Noem have all posted on social media in a bizarre fashion about the raids, with one August post from the DHS featuring a video of Ice agents raiding a car wash set to the 1976 single Car Wash by Rose Royce.

They have even had Dr Phil, the celebrity physician whose real name is Phil McGraw, attend, calling into question what purpose these raids serve for the agency.

Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, posted on Monday on X that he was not made aware of the federal government’s activities in the city when they began: “The City of Chicago received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration.

Roberts acted on the administration’s emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. President Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The high court order is temporary, though it suggests the justices will reverse a lower court ruling that withholding the funding was probably illegal. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) in a letter Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and the possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs. The administration turned to the high court after a panel of federal appellate judges declined to block Ali’s ruling.

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that an additional $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

City of Chicago

What we know:

Mayor Brandon Johnson announced last week that Chicago is expanding its ""Know Your Rights"" and ""Family Preparedness"" campaigns.

""My administration will not allow our communities to be consumed by fear and uncertainty. We will continue to provide updated information so that all of the families of Chicago are prepared,"" Johnson said in a statement.

The initiatives include printable and fillable preparedness packets, infographics and guides with trusted resources and community contacts, and weekly workshops to help families create safety and communication plans. The city also launched an upgraded immigrant and refugee rights website.

Chicago suburbs

Skokie, Bolingbrook, Evanston, and Maywood have echoed similar messages, reminding residents of their rights under Illinois law and pointing to legal aid hotlines, community resources, and village services.

Skokie officials emphasized the village’s compliance with the Illinois TRUST Act, which bars local police from enforcing federal immigration law.

""The Village of Skokie values inclusion, dignity and respect for all, and is committed to providing safe access to Village services and protecting the rights of all who live in our community,"" the village said.

SKOKIE RESOURCES

Bolingbrook leaders said their police department does not question immigration status during routine stops and does not notify ICE without a federal judicial warrant.

""The Bolingbrook Police Department is dedicated to building trust within our community and will not waste resources eroding it,"" BPD said.

Evanston warned of possible ICE presence and urged residents to use the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights hotline (855-435-7693) to report sightings.

EVANSTON RESOURCES

""In Evanston, we welcome our immigrant and refugee neighbors and protect each other,"" the city said. ""We will do all we can to safeguard our community and keep Evanston families together.""

City leaders stressed that Evanston police officers will continue to wear clearly marked uniforms or vests to distinguish themselves from federal agents. Residents who encounter suspicious or unmarked individuals claiming to be law enforcement are urged to call 911 or file a complaint with the Evanston Police Department.

Maywood Mayor Nathaniel George Booker said the village stands ""united with Illinois and Cook County"" and stressed that ""uninvited, unwanted and unjustified"" visits from ICE are not welcome.

""Together, we will ensure that no show of force is stronger than a united community,"" Booker said.

The backstory:

The warning comes as President Donald Trump has renewed his focus on Chicago, repeatedly citing violent crime as justification for tougher federal intervention.

Over the weekend, Trump pointed to recent shootings in Chicago and doubled down on plans to target immigration enforcement. He also defended a Truth Social post featuring an AI-generated image of himself styled as a Vietnam War movie character with the caption ""Chipocalypse Now,"" a post that critics said threatened deportations and military action in the city.

When pressed, Trump said his administration’s approach was about ""cleaning up cities,"" not war. Still, he has suggested deploying the National Guard to Chicago, calling it ""a mess.""

Local leaders say such rhetoric has fueled fear among immigrant families.

On Tuesday, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights reported that ICE vehicles were seen parked outside the Cook County Courthouse.

""During this time of uncertainty and fear, it is critical to maintain a strong sense of community, as well as provide accurate information,"" the City of Evanston said, adding they will continue to share updates and ""well-sourced information from credible sources"" as it becomes available.

At the start of Trump’s second term, his Republican administration said it would allow immigration arrests at schools — long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.

Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student’s father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn’t hear the commotion outside.

Teacher Lauren Fong, who teaches the child whose father was arrested that day, said she was troubled by the decision to confront the father in the school parking lot, which is private property.

“Why a school? Why not someplace else, any place else?” Fong said in an interview. “It was in the parking lot, where it could be witnessed by so many young children.”

The educators are joining a lawsuit filed in April by an Oregon farmworker union and a group of churches, challenging the Trump administration‘s decision to open houses of worship to immigration enforcement as well. The amended lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Eugene, Oregon.

A request for comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances. Homeland Security, according to a 2021 memo, could “accomplish (its) enforcement mission without denying or limiting individuals’ access to needed medical care, children access to their schools, the displaced access to food and shelter, people of faith access to their places of worship.”

A day after Trump took office, the department rescinded the memo and instead urged agents to use “common sense” when operating near schools and churches. In a statement, officials outlined their reasoning behind the move: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”

The lawsuit describes several instances of masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement making arrests in and around school and church grounds. In Los Angeles, masked border patrol officers descended on a car parked next to a high school and ordered a 15-year-old boy with disabilities out at gunpoint while searching for a man with gang ties. They handcuffed him and only released him when they discovered they had the wrong person.

The lawsuit includes testimonials from unnamed teachers who report seeing increased anxiety and decreased participation and attendance from students who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus. A speech pathologist at a California elementary school said immigrant parents were reluctant to sign up their children for special education services because it would mean giving more information to the school. A Texas high school teacher for students learning English said enrollment in her classes has dropped precipitously.

“America’s classrooms must be safe and welcoming places of learning and discovery,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Leaders in the heavily immigrant churches that sued also described increased anxiety and a drop in Mass attendance.

Lawyers argue Trump’s decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church. Rescinding the sensitive-locations memo, the lawsuit says, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which bars agencies from implementing policies that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”

The justification behind supplementing sitting immigration judges with temporary ones is the sheer size of the immigration court backlog, which, as of July 2025, consisted of almost 3.5 million pending cases.
The number of immigration judges has also grown over the years.
In 2010, there were 245 immigration judges, doubling to 466 in early 2020.

In a statement, Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell revealed that the DOW was “identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve” in such a capacity. The move is part of the Trump administration’s multi-pronged strategy to finally tackle the many overlapping crises plaguing our immigration system.

The policy was made possible by a new federal rule published by the DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on August 28. The new regulation liberalized the requirements to serve as temporary immigration judges (TIJs), thereby allowing “the Attorney General and Director of EOIR to select TIJs from a larger pool of well-qualified candidates.”

According to one news report, approximately 150 of the 600 military attorneys authorized to serve as temporary immigration judges may potentially start working in their new capacities as early as the first week of September. Others will undergo two weeks of training.

The justification behind supplementing sitting immigration judges with temporary ones is the sheer size of the immigration court backlog, which, as of July 2025, consisted of almost 3.5 million pending cases. This is just slightly smaller than the total population of America’s second largest city, Los Angeles. Only a decade ago in 2015, the backlog was less than 460,000 cases, growing to 1.3 million in 2020 and 3.7 million in 2024. The key factors in growing this massive backlog were high levels of illegal immigration and large-scale asylum abuse.

The number of immigration judges has also grown over the years. In 2010, there were 245 immigration judges, doubling to 466 in early 2020. In 2025, there were approximately 700. Given the backlog, the pro-mass-migration media has argued that the termination of some 100 immigration judges by the Trump administration makes little sense and works at cross-purposes with the administration’s goals of mass removals and clearing the backlog. What they fail to mention is that the Biden administration was not averse to firing immigration judges either. The difference is that the Biden administration terminated immigration judges who believed in upholding the law and discouraging asylum fraud while the Trump administration fired judges who rubberstamped practically all asylum applications, some with asylum grant rates of 96 percent – which, of course, only incentivizes more asylum-fraud-driven illegal immigration, thereby adding to the backlog.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Judge-holding-gavel-in-courtroom-104821184_4841x3633.jpg.webp?itok=9-jXx-Tw,N,,2025-09-10 12:56:52.950282

The strange reference to a “secret” shared between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.
Last week, a local judge blocked South Carolina from releasing private voter information to the Justice Department.
A federal database would be out of date a day after any voter list was turned over to federal officials.
“Ask how many people are satisfied with what the Justice Department has done on the Jeffrey Epstein files,” he said.","The decision from Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia marked only the first salvo in what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle over the president’s ability to remove a Fed official “for cause,” a term generally understood to mean professional neglect or wrongdoing.

In her ruling, Judge Cobb said Mr. Trump’s justifications for removing Ms. Cook did not meet the threshold for sufficient cause, in part because the action in question took place before her tenure as a Fed governor began. Ms. Cook signed her mortgage documents in 2021, roughly a year before she joined the Fed after being appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“The best reading of the ‘for cause’ provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are limited to grounds concerning a governor’s behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties,” she said. “‘For cause’ thus does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they began in office.”

Lawyers at the Justice Department argued in their first hearing that the president had expansive powers to determine what constitutes cause and that the court should be “highly deferential” to that interpretation.

Judge Cobb hit back at that assertion directly in her ruling. “According to the government, the determination of cause is committed to the president’s discretion by statute, leaving no role for this court. The court disagrees,” she said.

Ms. Cook also was denied adequate due process, Judge Cobb argued, agreeing with a central part of her lawyers’ argument.

“Today’s ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference,” Ms. Cook’s attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement. “Allowing the president to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law.”

The Trump administration is likely to appeal the ruling. In a statement, Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said the president had “lawfully removed” Ms. Cook, adding: “This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed.”

The judge’s order means that Ms. Cook will be able to cast a vote when the Fed gathers for its next two-day meeting, which will begin on Tuesday. The central bank is expected to restart interest rate cuts that have been on hold since January, most likely reducing borrowing costs a quarter point.

The Fed declined to comment on the ruling. It had previously pledged to carry out any decision rendered by the court.

“Removal protection is an important measure that helps insulate the Fed from inappropriate political interference,” said Graham Steele, a longtime financial regulation lawyer and former Treasury Department official. “The court’s thorough and well-reasoned decision reaches the right conclusion.”

Mr. Trump has sought to force down borrowing costs for months, accusing Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and other officials at the central bank of harming the economy by not moving quickly enough to cut rates. The Fed has kept its benchmark rate set in a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent since January. Mr. Trump has called on the Fed to slash borrowing costs by three percentage points.

The president is seeking to gain a majority of support on the Fed’s board, which would give him not only greater sway over deliberations related to interest rates and the oversight of Wall Street but also leverage over the 12 regional Fed presidents, who vote on big policy decisions on a rotating basis, as well as the central bank’s staff.

In its ruling, the court declined to take up the issue of Mr. Trump’s motivation for firing Ms. Cook.

Now, with the release this week of new information from Mr. Epstein’s estate, including a suggestive note apparently signed by Mr. Trump, the drip-drip-drip of revelations is complicating the White House strategy of brushing off the entire controversy.

The president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Tuesday was once again confronted with questions about the so-called Epstein files, a collection of documents from the law enforcement investigation into Mr. Epstein’s abuse of girls and women.

The White House has denied for weeks that Mr. Trump sent a bawdy birthday note to Mr. Epstein in 2003, the subject of an earlier Wall Street Journal report. But on Monday, the House Oversight Committee obtained the document and released it.

Suddenly, there it was out in the open for all to see. The drawing of a naked woman. The strange reference to a “secret” shared between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.

In response, Ms. Leavitt at first deflected. She accused Democrats of opportunistically clamoring to release the Epstein documents while Mr. Trump was president, something they did not make a major push for during the Biden presidency.

“Why are the Democrats all of a sudden caring about this? It’s because they are desperately trying to concoct a hoax to smear the president of the United States,” Ms. Leavitt said.

Then she shifted to denial.

Ms. Leavitt again denied that Mr. Trump had written the note in question. She said the White House would even support a professional handwriting analyst’s evaluation of the signature, which she said would vindicate the president.

The signature on the note closely matches the first-name-only version of the way the president signed his name in letters to New York City officials at the time.

Ms. Leavitt was then asked about another item in the documents released Monday: an oversized check that purports to be a joking payment of $22,500 from Mr. Trump to Mr. Epstein, to buy a “fully depreciated” woman.

Ms. Leavitt again denied Mr. Trump’s involvement, saying he “absolutely” had not signed the check in question.

But even as Ms. Leavitt called the situation a “hoax” and claimed Mr. Trump had no role in the documents released, she said she had never claimed they were fake.

The documents were subpoenaed from the Epstein estate. Under questioning from reporters, Ms. Leavitt said she “did not say the documents are a hoax.” Instead, she suggested that someone must have forged Mr. Trump’s signature. “The president has one of the most famous signatures in the world, and he has for many, many years,” she said.

It was clear she was following the lead of her boss.

Throughout the month of July, Mr. Trump repeatedly attempted to instruct the media and fellow Republicans to move on from the Epstein files. In a post on Truth Social, he urged the G.O.P. to “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

But the clamor for the files persisted, and the president repeatedly referred to the controversy as a “hoax,” angering Mr. Epstein’s victims.

After The Wall Street Journal reported on the Epstein birthday note, Mr. Trump filed suit accusing the paper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, of defaming him.

“These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Mr. Trump has long drawn pictures and even sold them at auction.)

He repeated his denial on Tuesday night, saying that “anybody that’s covered me for a long time knows that’s not my language. It’s nonsense.”

Democrats have seized on the controversy. But more concerning for Mr. Trump, he has not been able to convince all Republicans to back off an effort to release the files.

Four Republicans, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, have joined with Democrats to support what is called a discharge petition to force the release of the files.

Still, Republicans have mostly fought the effort, and G.O.P. leaders in Congress have largely sided with Mr. Trump’s insistence that he played no role in the bawdy birthday note to Mr. Epstein.

“I’m told that it’s fake,” Speaker Mike Johnson said of the note.

Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, said that he accepted Mr. Trump’s denial about the note.

“The president says he did not sign it, so I take the president at his word,” Mr. Comer said on Tuesday.

He added that he was not inclined to investigate the signature’s authenticity, even as Mr. Comer is leading an investigation into the legitimacy of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature on documents that were signed with an autopen.

Michael Gold contributed reporting.

Chief Justice Roberts’s order noted that the money is the subject of a proposal from the administration pending before Congress. That proposal, known as a “pocket rescission,” is a legally untested effort to claw back appropriated money by waiting so late in the fiscal year to make the request that lawmakers do not have time to reject it before the funding expires. It could make the court challenge moot.

The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, before the 45-day period in which Congress is required to consider a rescission request from the White House. Republicans could bring the matter to a vote sooner, but party leaders have shown little appetite for resisting the president’s spending demands and asserting their own prerogatives.

The case before the Supreme Court has reached the justices three times. In an emergency application filed Monday, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, told the court that the judge’s order requiring it to spend $4 billion in payments by the end of the month raised “a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.”

Mr. Sauer noted the proposal before Congress. “While proposed rescissions are pending, presidents do not spend the funds, for obvious reasons: it would be self-defeating and senseless for the executive branch to obligate the very funds that it is asking Congress to rescind,” he wrote. “Yet the new injunction would force the executive branch to start obligating those funds at breakneck speed to meet the Sept. 30 deadline, even as Congress is considering the rescission proposal and before its 45 days to do so elapse.”

The application was the latest in a barrage of emergency requests by the administration seeking broad executive authority, including the power to halt federal spending appropriated by Congress for programs at odds with President Trump’s agenda.

The Supreme Court, with six conservative justices, has proved receptive to most of the administration’s claims, handing the president a series of technically temporary victories that have nevertheless had broad practical consequences. In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Still, in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case, in March, the chief justice and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, two nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s authority over spending.

The case has bounced around the court system. The latest application concerns a ruling last week from Judge Amir Ali of the Federal District Court in Washington that said the administration had “given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress’s appropriations must be followed” and requiring the administration to allow the funds to flow.

A federal appeals court last month invalidated many of President Trump’s punishing global tariffs, saying the law he relied on did not authorize the administration’s program. The import taxes remain in effect while the litigation continues.

In a 7-to-4 ruling in late August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the president had unlawfully used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose steep taxes on major U.S. trading partners.

Last week, Mr. Trump’s lawyers urged the justices to review the ruling quickly by adding the case to the court’s calendar for the new term that begins in October. They issued a stark warning against allowing the appeals court ruling to stand, saying it threatens to unwind trade deals.

“That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the president has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,” according to the filing from Solicitor General D. John Sauer.

“Few cases have so clearly called out for this court’s swift resolution.”

While the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has repeatedly granted Mr. Trump’s emergency requests and cleared the way for the administration to at least temporarily put into place its policies, the tariffs case will be the first occasion for the justices to hear arguments and weigh the underlying legal merits of a key administration priority.

Five small businesses and a dozen states sued over the tariffs, saying Mr. Trump’s actions were unlawful and that the powers to tax must remain with Congress. Their position has support from a coalition of prominent conservative and libertarian lawyers, scholars and former officials.

“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement.

The Constitution generally gives Congress the power to tax. But a 1977 statute gives the president broad emergency powers to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to regulate imports. The president’s lawyers say that language affords him the authority to impose tariffs when he believe an emergency exists.

Mr. Trump and his economic advisers say the tariffs and subsequent negotiations with trading partners are reversing decades of trade policies that have reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity and military readiness. The levies, they argue, have spurred other countries to invest in the U.S. economy.

But the appeals court said the emergency law does not give Mr. Trump the authority to impose his sprawling tariffs program. The majority did not decide whether the statute might allow the president to impose more limited tariffs, finding Mr. Trump’s particular program so significant and enduring that it must be expressly authorized by Congress.

Mr. Trump used the emergency law last month to tax imports from about 90 countries and previously invoked it to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.

Other presidents have invoked the emergency statute, typically to issue sanctions, but Mr. Trump is the first to try to use the emergency powers to impose broad levies of 10 to 50 percent on trading partners. The administration can turn to other statutes to impose tariffs, but they are more limited than the emergency powers he has relied on.

Separately, the Supreme Court in June refused to fast-track a second case from two toy manufacturers challenging part of the president’s tariffs program. In that case, the companies were seeking to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has scheduled argument for Sept. 30. A district court judge sided with the companies, finding that the tariffs were not authorized under the emergency statute and were “an existential threat to their businesses.”

Lawyers for the toy manufacturers renewed their request to the justices in a filing Thursday, asking the court to consider consolidating and expediting the pair of cases involving tariffs.

The New York Times obtained a draft of the report in August. The final report is largely unchanged, and does not always clearly explain how the government will implement its recommendations.

In the report, Mr. Kennedy has returned to his usual talking points: that American children are sick, stressed and screen-addicted, and that corporate interests and prescription medications are to blame. It is the clearest articulation yet of how the administration plans to carry out the aims of the MAHA movement.

Yet even with the familiar rhetoric, the report is very likely to disappoint some corners of Mr. Kennedy’s MAHA coalition.

It demonstrates both the ambitions and limits of his agenda. It stops short of calling for direct restrictions on pesticides and ultraprocessed foods, which Mr. Kennedy has called major threats. The strategy suggests collaboration — not confrontation — with the food and agriculture industries, saying that the government will back “precision agricultural techniques” to help farmers use less pesticides. After The Times reported on the draft, some members of the MAHA movement expressed frustration at what they saw as signs of Mr. Kennedy’s capitulations to these industries.

Read the MAHA strategy report.

A report from the White House outlines strategies to combat childhood chronic disease and attempts to set a MAHA agenda for the country.

Read Document 20 pages

The report points to a number of actions the Trump administration has already announced and branded victories, including establishing an infertility training center, cracking down on food dyes, relaunching the Presidential Fitness Test in public schools, studying the “root causes” of autism and working to define ultraprocessed foods and update the U.S. dietary guidelines.

Other significant parts of the strategy are at odds with actions the administration has taken. For example, the report calls for providing “whole, healthy food” through the government-funded SNAP nutrition program for low-income Americans — but Mr. Trump signed legislation this year that significantly cut SNAP funding. It also suggests prioritizing research and analysis of the health effects of poor water and air quality, but the administration has abandoned major pollution regulations.

There are also places where the report’s goals conflict with each other. For example, it says the government will “review new scientific information on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water,” but also identifies poor oral health and childhood cavities — which fluoride in drinking water helps prevent, according to decades of research — as potential causes of chronic disease. It says the C.D.C. will issue new recommendations on fluoride in water, which Mr. Kennedy has called dangerous despite the fact that most U.S. water supplies fall well within what scientists consider safe fluoride limits.

The report contains a few bold ideas, but not always a clear path to implementing them. The document suggests the government will crack down on direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs, and calls for closing the so-called “GRAS” loophole, a provision that lets companies put new chemicals or ingredients into food products as long as they are “generally recognized as safe.” It also says the government will consider developing guidelines to limit the ways companies market “unhealthy” foods to children.

In May, the commission released a report that blamed ultraprocessed foods, toxic chemicals and prescription drugs for fueling “the sickest generation in American history.” The May document cited studies that did not exist, and in some cases drew faulty conclusions from existing evidence.

Tuesday’s 20-page document charges the government with “ensuring America has the best childhood vaccine schedule” at a time when Mr. Kennedy has named vaccine critics to a key vaccine advisory panel, overseen changes that restrict Americans’ access to Covid vaccines and seeded doubt about the safety and effectiveness of many shots. The report also calls for new research into vaccine injuries, a topic Mr. Kennedy has consistently brought up as he fuels suspicion around routine immunizations.

It also says the government will create education campaigns aimed at improving fertility and will evaluate “overprescription trends” in the use of SSRIs, antipsychotics, stimulants and other mental health drugs for children.

Though the report pushes for new research initiatives and public awareness campaigns, it does not include many specific policies. It says the government will commission a slew of new studies to better understand microplastics, air quality, the cumulative toll of chemicals and even electromagnetic radiation. It also says the surgeon general will start campaigns on educating children about the effects of screen time, vaping, cannabis and alcohol. (The current nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, has not yet been confirmed.)

It is not clear how the government might fund these initiatives. The Trump administration has made large cuts to scientific funding over the last few months.

Mr. Kennedy and other members of the commission, including Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, and Dr. Marty Makary, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, are speaking at an event at 2 p.m. Eastern to release the report.

Its proponents, Representatives Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, appear poised within weeks to draw enough backers to force action on the House floor, provided Democrats win special elections this month in districts where they are heavily favored.

But while their effort is expected to continue being a political headache for Republican leaders and the White House, there is still no guarantee it will receive a vote, and little chance that the House would compel the Justice Department to comply even if it passed.

Here’s how it works.

A House majority can force action, even if leaders object.

Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump administration officials had hoped they could thwart Mr. Massie and Mr. Khanna’s effort to force their measure to the floor.

But Mr. Massie, a frequent Trump antagonist, is on the brink of drawing enough support from the House to move forward. Last week, he introduced what is known as a discharge petition, a maneuver that allows lawmakers to circumvent party leaders and bring a bill to the floor if 218 lawmakers demand it.

By the time the House Oversight Committee investigating the handling of Mr. Epstein’s case released a 2003 drawing and note that appeared to contain Mr. Trump’s signature, the petition had 216 signatures. Just four are from Republican representatives: Mr. Massie and Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

Mr. Johnson has made his opposition to the discharge petition explicit, and Mr. Massie has said that the White House has been pressuring lawmakers not to sign. Several Republicans who supported Mr. Massie’s resolution have withdrawn, and the effort to win more appeared to stall.

But the two signatures that Mr. Massie needs could come later this month from newly elected Democrats, who are projected this month to win special elections in deep-blue districts to succeed lawmakers who died in office this year.

James Walkinshaw is the favorite to win an election on Tuesday in a Northern Virginia district left vacant since May by the death of Representative Gerald E. Connolly, whom he served as chief of staff. Mr. Walkinshaw has promised to sign Mr. Massie’s discharge petition if he is elected.

Two weeks later, Adelita Grijalva is expected to win a special election in a solidly Democratic district in Arizona to succeed her father, Representative Raul M. Grijalva, a 12-term congressman who died in March. She is also expected to join the rest of her party in signing Mr. Massie’s petition.

A vote would be politically toxic for the G.O.P.

Should both Democrats win and sign, Republican leaders would find themselves in a political jam as they continue to navigate competing demands from Mr. Trump.

After his administration promised shocking revelations in the case, the president has weathered a backlash for its sudden reversal and refusal to make public its investigative files. He has condemned the continued fallout as a Democratic hoax, and lashed out at his own supporters for demanding more information on the investigation into Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in federal prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

If the measure were to pass, it is not clear whether the Republican-led Congress, which has deferred to Mr. Trump at every turn, would take any action if the Justice Department declined to comply with its demand for the files. That would require a separate vote to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress.

But a vote on whether to compel the release of the files would be politically painful for Republicans who have echoed the calls of constituents who have long clamored for the material. They would have to choose between backing the voters who elected them or backing Mr. Trump in his desire to keep the matter closed.

Republican leaders are still trying avoid a vote.

Even if the petition were to receive the requisite 218 signatures to force action, there is no guarantee it would proceed to the floor. House leaders have a range of procedural maneuvers they can use to thwart legislation even if it has the support of a majority of the House.

The White House is also expected to continue trying to pressure the Republicans who have signed the discharge petition to remove their names. And Republican leaders have pointed to the Oversight Committee’s investigation and recent release of files as evidence that no vote by the full House is needed to assure transparency on the Epstein case.

News of the recall came amid a debate over the Trump administration’s policy toward the country. Mr. Grenell, who serves as an envoy to Venezuela, has advocated negotiations with its authoritarian government, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio has pushed for a more hard-line approach.

But other officials said the recall of the report had little to do with competing camps in the Trump administration and was more about improperly identifying a senior official in an intelligence document.

The report focused on Mr. Grenell’s conversations and negotiations with Nicolás Maduro, the authoritarian leader of Venezuela, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The report and the recall were issued several months ago, at a time when Mr. Grenell was negotiating the return of undocumented immigrants to Venezuela, according to people briefed on the report.

President Trump had appointed Mr. Grenell as an envoy to Venezuela and asked him to lead negotiations. Mr. Rubio was working on a different track on Venezuelan negotiations.

The original report was circulated throughout the intelligence community. But more recently, the White House has ordered spy agencies to limit the number of people receiving intelligence on Venezuela.

The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies routinely retract reports when new information renders old ones erroneous or if mistakes are detected. But the unclassified note retracting the Venezuela report noted that the N.S.A. work remained sound.

“The report is accurate and in accordance with all N.S.A. policy, directives and guidance; however, the D.N.I. directed N.S.A. to recall the report,” the recall notice said, referring to the director of national intelligence.

Multiple people briefed on the matter insisted the report was recalled because it did not adequately hide Mr. Grenell’s identity, describing him as the presidential envoy to Venezuela. Ms. Gabbard has asked intelligence agencies to take special care with reports that either directly identify Trump administration officials or are written in ways that could easily identify them.

During the first Trump administration, the issue of “unmasking” U.S. officials who were caught up in communications intercepts became a contentious issue. As a result, Ms. Gabbard has tried to avoid identifying Americans in intelligence reports out of concern for privacy and civil liberties, multiple U.S. officials said.

Some administration officials said that making edits to intelligence reports is commonplace, adding that the N.S.A. document was later republished, stripping the identifying information from it. But other officials disputed that account and said there was no evidence an updated report was produced or circulated.

The N.S.A. report appears to have included information about Mr. Grenell that was collected by the spy agency. It is not clear whether that involved conversations between two foreigners or conversations Mr. Grenell had directly with Mr. Maduro. The N.S.A. is not supposed to deliberately target the messages of Americans for surveillance, but it nevertheless collects communications involving or about Americans while targeting foreigners abroad.

Mr. Grenell declined to comment. The National Security Agency and a White House official did not comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Grenell has been at odds with Mr. Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, over the Trump administration’s policy on Venezuela.

Mr. Grenell has pushed for a deal-making approach that seeks reaching agreements with the Maduro government that could benefit American energy companies. Mr. Rubio has taken a much harder line, vetoing any energy deals, and supported the more militaristic approach the administration is currently pursuing with Venezuela.

A deal to release hostages held in the country fell apart this year, after Mr. Grenell and Mr. Rubio’s State Department pursued separate deals. Mr. Grenell was pressing for an agreement that would have allowed American oil companies to do business in Venezuela. Chevron has been particularly interested in continuing its oil operations in Venezuela, a vital source of revenue for its authoritarian government. Mr. Rubio opposed that concession.

The initiative has proceeded along two tracks, one at the Justice Department’s civil rights division and another at its criminal division, seeking data about individual voters across the country, including names and addresses, in a move that experts say may violate the law. It is a significant break from decades of practice by Republican and Democratic administrations, which believed that doing so was federal overreach and ripe for abuse.

“Nobody has ever done anything like this,” said Justin Levitt, an election law expert at Loyola Marymount University’s law school and a former Justice Department official.

The Justice Department has requested data from at least 16 Republican-controlled states, including Mississippi, Alabama and Texas. It has also sent more formal demands for data to at least 17 mostly Democrat-controlled or swing states, including Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin and New York.

Nearly every state has resisted turning over voter files with private, personally identifiable information on voters like driver’s license numbers or Social Security numbers. Last week, a local judge blocked South Carolina from releasing private voter information to the Justice Department.

In a private meeting with the staff of top state election officials last month, Michael Gates, a deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division, disclosed that all 50 states would eventually receive similar requests, according to notes of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times. In particular, he said, the federal government wants the last four digits of every voter’s Social Security number.

The administration plans to compare that voter data to a different database, maintained by the Department of Homeland Security, to see how many registered voters on the state lists match up with noncitizens listed by immigration agents, according to people familiar with the matter.

Justin R. Erickson, the general counsel for Minnesota’s secretary of state, raised fears that the data would be used to further the administration’s own priorities. In a letter last month to the Justice Department, he wrote, “Equally concerning is the possibility that the D.O.J. will use the data inappropriately and the fact that the D.O.J. does not appear to have complied with the necessary legal requirements to obtain or use data on several million people.”

Studies and state audits have found that noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent.

Mr. Levitt likened the effort to sending federal troops to bolster local police work. “It’s wading in, without authorization and against the law, with an overly heavy federal hand to take over a function that states are actually doing just fine,” he said, adding that “it’s wildly illegal, deeply troubling, and nobody asked for this.”

In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman, Gates McGavick, said, “Enforcing the nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the civil rights division.”

He cited longstanding voting laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Civil Rights Act, saying that it gave the department leeway to obtain the data. Doing so will “ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections,” Mr. McGavick added.

Already, the Justice Department has made extraordinary moves in the name of election integrity. It has unsuccessfully sought access to voting machines in Missouri and weighed the possibility of pursuing criminal investigations of state election officials over how they have done their jobs.

A memo from the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities obtained by The Times detailed the request by the Justice Department to scrutinize equipment used in the 2020 election.

The memo states that “Missouri is now part of a multistate attempt by the Department of Justice to access, physically inspect and perhaps take physical custody of election equipment used in the 2020 November general election.” At least two counties in the state received a request from Andrew McCoy Warner, a Justice Department official.

The Missouri Independent earlier reported the requests for machines.

Employees at the agency have been clear that they are interested in a central, federal database of voter information. In a letter to multiple states, Scott Laragy and Paul Hayden, two prosecutors from the criminal division, asked to “discuss a potential information-sharing agreement” that would help the department investigate election fraud.

“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce federal election laws and protect the integrity of federal elections,” the lawyers wrote to election officials in Connecticut, according to records obtained by The Times. Multiple states, including Georgia and Nevada, received similar requests.

While the department has sought to gather all the data itself, Trump administration officials have also offered some states a slightly different option. In conversations with at least two states, prosecutors from the civil rights division asked election officials to simply run their entire voter list through the federal database for citizenship records, known as the SAVE database, that is housed by the Department of Homeland Security.

D.H.S. officials have also contacted election officials with a similar request, according to records obtained by The Times. North Carolina received a letter inviting it to the “soft launch” of a new functionality of the database using the last four digits of a Social Security number.

Mr. Levitt said requests by the Justice Department for states to explain how they maintain voter lists were aboveboard. But what officials are demanding from many states goes so far beyond that, he said, that the moves may violate the Privacy Act, a post-Watergate law that carries criminal penalties and forbids the federal government from gathering certain types of information about citizens without stating beforehand the purpose of the data collection.

When Mr. Gates, a top lawyer in the civil rights division, met with the staff of top state election officials, he said the purpose of collecting the data was to conduct tests and analysis to ensure total compliance with federal laws. He did not specify the type of test or analysis, though acknowledged that officials would be receptive to sharing more detail in conferring with individual states.

Adrian Fontes, the Democratic secretary of state in Arizona, voiced unease in a statement responding to Justice Department requests. “Arizona voters deserve to participate in elections without fear that their personal information will be collected and stored in federal systems without proper legal safeguards or transparency,” he wrote, adding that the demands “raise serious legal and constitutional concerns.”

Outside voting rights and good governance organizations expressed alarm that the moves signaled an overarching scheme by the Trump administration to interfere in the midterm elections.

“The biggest structural concern is using this information in an irresponsible manner to fuel the narrative that something is amiss in any election in which the preferred outcome is not the actual outcome,” said Sophia Lin Lakin, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Election officials also note that creating a federal database has its own complications. A state’s voter file is not a static document; new voter registrations, changes in address, deaths and other adjustments to voter rolls take place every day. A federal database would be out of date a day after any voter list was turned over to federal officials.

Even as states are mostly responsible for overseeing voter rolls, the executive branch has tried in the past to do so, most notably during the first Trump administration.

After the 2016 election, Mr. Trump created a commission charged with rooting out voter fraud, putting Kris Kobach, then the secretary of state in Kansas, in charge. But Mr. Kobach’s requests for sensitive voter information were nearly universally denied by election officials, and Mr. Trump abruptly shut down the commission in 2018.

This March, Mr. Trump, who has falsely claimed his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud, issued an executive order intended to force states to more aggressively examine its voter rolls.

The order suggests that any states that fail to comply could face lawsuits, or lose federal funding.

But almost every election official has steadfastly refused to hand over private data.

“Nowhere does the Constitution provide the president or the executive branch with any independent power to control or otherwise conscript states to carry out nonstatutory policy priorities of the president,” Shirley Weber, the Democratic secretary of state in California, wrote to the department in August, adding, “My office is not obligated to follow along.”

Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of the commonwealth in Pennsylvania, wrote that the department’s requests “represent a concerning attempt to expand the federal government’s role in our country’s electoral process.” Mr. Schmidt, like the leaders of other states, offered the Justice Department publicly available voter files, but denied the request for more sensitive, private information from voters.

Election experts and officials worry what else the Trump administration may try to do with the data. The Department of Government Efficiency tried to cross-reference various giant government data sets to accomplish a number of policy goals, including reviving false claims of extensive voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.

At her confirmation hearing to become attorney general in January, Pam Bondi said she accepted “the result” of the 2020 election, but in the next breath suggested there were major problems with the vote.

“I saw many things” in Pennsylvania, she said. She had gone to Pennsylvania after the election to amplify misleading claims of mass voter fraud, including helping arrange a news conference at a Philadelphia-area business, Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Around that time, she told Fox News that “we know that ballots have been dumped,” and that she had heard “people were receiving ballots that were dead.”

In less than a year of the new administration, Mr. Levitt said, the Justice Department has burned so much of its credibility with the public and the courts that any of its findings under Ms. Bondi based on the voter roll data were unlikely to be persuasive.

“Ask how many people are satisfied with what the Justice Department has done on the Jeffrey Epstein files,” he said. “It’s not just among liberals that they have lost credibility.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/22/multimedia/09trump-news-promo-1020p/22dc-fed-explain-mwpg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:58:10.500972

The document contradicts claims by the agency that all 475 people arrested during the raid were working illegally or violating their visas.
He was at the Hyundai factory as a contractor with a South Korean company.
The raid angered the South Korean government, which announced billions of dollars of investment in the US following a new trade deal between the countries.
On Sunday, the South Korean and US governments negotiated a deal to take the arrested workers home.","At least one of the Korean workers swept up in a huge immigration raid on a Hyundai Motor factory site in Georgia last week was living and working legally in the US, according to an internal federal government document obtained by the Guardian.

Officials then “mandated” that he agree to be removed from the US despite not having violated his visa.

The document shows that immigration officials are aware that someone with a valid visa was among the people arrested during the raid at the Hyundai factory and taken to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention for removal proceedings, where the people arrested remained on Tuesday before expected deportation flights back to South Korea.

The document in question reports on the man’s case and was leaked exclusively to the Guardian. It was written by an Ice agent. The Guardian is redacting the identity of the man in question, who arrived in the US in June, because it has not been possible to reach him directly and it is unclear whether he has any legal representation.

The document says that immigration agents from Atlanta “determined that [redacted] entered into the United States in [redacted], with a valid B1/B2 visa and [redacted] was employed at HL-GA Battery Company LLC as a contractor from the South Korean company SFA. From statements made and queries in law enforcement databases, [redacted] has not violated his visa; however, the Atlanta Field Office Director has mandated [redacted] be presented as a Voluntary Departure. [Redacted] has accepted voluntary departure despite not violating his B1/B2 visa requirements.”

The internal file describes “an actual crime”, according to Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney based in Georgia – but with the crime allegedly being committed by the government, not the detainee in question. Kuck, who is representing a number of people arrested during last week’s raid, said it was illegal to detain a valid visa holder in this way.

“This is outrageous,” Kuck said.

The document contradicts claims by the agency that all 475 people arrested during the raid were working illegally or violating their visas. Attorneys scrambling in recent days to provide representation to the men detained had already claimed that immigrants with a valid working status were swept up alongside the people allegedly working unlawfully, and placed in removal proceedings. That view was backed up by an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.

The arrest “is illegal”, the official claimed in an interview with the Guardian. The government maintains it is the detainee who acted unlawfully.

It is not yet clear whether other people with valid visas were detained in the raid, nor how many were actually alleged to be working illegally at the factory.

Approximately 300 people arrested could be put on flights back to South Korea as early as Wednesday, according to one source familiar with events who requested anonymity to speak about what is going on behind the scenes. Non-Koreans arrested during the operation are expected to remain in Ice detention.

Last Thursday, Ice led a raid at the Hyundai battery factory under construction in Ellabell, near Savannah, Georgia, and arrested nearly 500 people, the majority of whom were from South Korea, part of a $12.6bn investment program in Georgia by the company. Construction had to be halted on the plant that is designed to supply batteries for electric vehicles.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the federal parent agency of Ice, said in a statement to the Guardian that: “This individual admitted to unauthorized work on a B1/B2 visa. He was offered voluntary departure and accepted it,” despite this being the opposite of what the leaked document says. When pressed for further clarification, the DHS reiterated its first statement. Ice did not respond to a request for comment about legal workers being arrested.

“This is a clear violation of the law in detaining somebody who is not lawfully detainable,” Kuck said. “That’s a crime – that’s unlawful imprisonment in the United States. This isn’t an accident. People go to prison for stuff like this.”

According to the file written by an agent with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), an agency within Ice, the man entered the US “with a valid B1/B2 visa”, which allows for some business-related activities and tourism. He was at the Hyundai factory as a contractor with a South Korean company.

“‘ Voluntarily’ means something different in immigration than it does in the real world,” Kuck said. “When you basically leave under Ice custody, then you have immigration consequences that come with that, including the loss of visa and possibly an inability to return [to the US].”

After the raid, additional Ice officers and agents were sent to the detention facility to process the sheer number of people arrested, according to the agency official who spoke to the Guardian.

Although officials say that the people arrested were in some violation of immigration laws, many others with valid legal status were offered voluntary departure, the official claimed. The official added that it was unclear what would happen with any legal immigrants who refuse to be deported voluntarily, since there is “no legal mechanism to remove them if they are not in violation” of US civil immigration laws. There is no suggestion that the Korean man in question has a criminal record in the US.

“The arrest itself is illegal and this just might be a way of pushing up [arrest] numbers and covering up mistakes,” the official added.

The raid angered the South Korean government, which announced billions of dollars of investment in the US following a new trade deal between the countries. On Sunday, the South Korean and US governments negotiated a deal to take the arrested workers home.

“These workers were put in incredibly vulnerable positions,” said Samantha Hamilton, a litigation attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. She emphasized that the men had ended up imperiled simply by taking up the opportunity of work on what was an ambitious international project.

The DHS and Ice did not respond to requests for comment on allegations that they are pressuring the detainees to agree to be deported.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4dd8559da79835057ccaf1dd6908646be8ce43/336_0_3328_2662/master/3328.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39e495a9b58d20f36877725b1eabdf89",N,,2025-09-10 11:57:36.359451

The wanted stood outside of a U-Haul truck rental outlet in the San Gabriel Valley. They polished other people’s BMWs and Range Rovers at a Pasadena car wash. I saw the wanted women too, walking to jobs as nannies and housekeepers.

They looked suspicious, all right, by the definition outlined Monday by Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. They were natives of Mexico and Central America, seeking “certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction.”

They were suspect to many Californians too, but only of wanting to work, wanting to earn a little cash, wanting to pay their bills and feed their families. One hundred and seventy five years to the day after land that once belonged to Mexico became the 31st American state, California felt to many people Tuesday like it had reverted to a kind of frontier justice, where racial profiling had become the law of the land.

“I am just working hard and paying taxes,” said Mario, 50, between sips of coffee on the sidewalk outside the U-Haul station. Even before the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids began three months ago, the Honduran immigrant said, life for street-corner workers was not easy.

“People are just looking for work. Some of them are even homeless,” said Mario, who declined to give his last name. “But some people are showing them hate, sometimes even hitting or kicking the homeless. We see it out on the street.”

At the Pasadena car wash where six workers were carted away in late August, those left behind continued their buffing and polishing Tuesday.

“It feels like we have come down low, really low,” said Cesar, between checking in customers. Though he was born just blocks away at Pasadena’s Huntington Hospital, he said he does not feel immune from the raids.

“If now they are just going to judge you by how you look, or maybe how you talk, I can get pulled over. Anyone can get pulled over,” said Cesar, who did not give his last name. “It’s gonna be harder for people to live a normal life. They’re gonna just have to deal with harassment. That’s not something I would want anyone to have to go through.”

Earlier raids by Trump immigration agents have spread far beyond snagging the criminals and drug traffickers the president and his allies claimed to be after. With 10 million Latinos living in the seven Southern California counties covered by the court’s order, a rights group said the high court’s action cleared the way for “an extraordinarily expansive dragnet, placing millions of law-abiding people at imminent risk of detention by federal agents.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

The action offered portentous echoes of the mistreatment and greater violence unleashed on Chinese immigrants in the late 1800s. Today, it had U.S.-born citizens, such as The Times’ Gustavo Arellano, feeling they will have to carry their passports to prove their citizenship.

Outside the U-Haul, Mario said he holds a green card. So he will continue waiting on the sidewalk for his next job.

“I believe in God,” he said. “We might think different things, but we all have the same heart. There should be the same heart for everyone. Everyone.”

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances.

Lawyers argue Trump's decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Labor unions representing millions of educators and school employees are suing President Donald Trump's administration over its immigration crackdown, saying arrests near school campuses are terrorizing children and their teachers, leading some students to drop out.

At the start of Trump's second term, his Republican administration said it would allow immigration arrests at schools — long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent more than 4 million school employees nationwide.

Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student's father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn't hear the commotion outside.

Teacher Lauren Fong, who teaches the child whose father was arrested that day, said she was troubled by the decision to confront the father in the school parking lot, which is private property.

“Why a school? Why not someplace else, any place else?"" Fong said in an interview. “It was in the parking lot, where it could be witnessed by so many young children.”

The educators are joining a lawsuit filed in April by an Oregon farmworker union and a group of churches, challenging the Trump administration's decision to open houses of worship to immigration enforcement as well. The amended lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Eugene, Oregon.

A request for comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances. Homeland Security, according to a 2021 memo, could “accomplish (its) enforcement mission without denying or limiting individuals’ access to needed medical care, children access to their schools, the displaced access to food and shelter, people of faith access to their places of worship.""

A day after Trump took office, the department rescinded the memo and instead urged agents to use “common sense” when operating near schools and churches. In a statement, officials outlined their reasoning behind the move: ""Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”

The lawsuit describes several instances of masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement making arrests in and around school and church grounds. In Los Angeles, masked border patrol officers descended on a car parked next to a high school and ordered a 15-year-old boy with disabilities out at gunpoint while searching for a man with gang ties. They handcuffed him and only released him when they discovered they had the wrong person.

The lawsuit includes testimonials from unnamed teachers who report seeing increased anxiety and decreased participation and attendance from students who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus. A speech pathologist at a California elementary school said immigrant parents were reluctant to sign up their children for special education services because it would mean giving more information to the school. A Texas high school teacher for students learning English said enrollment in her classes has dropped precipitously.

“America’s classrooms must be safe and welcoming places of learning and discovery,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said the Trump administration is creating fear and chaos and ""our students, schools, and communities are paying the price.”

Leaders in the heavily immigrant churches that sued also described increased anxiety and a drop in Mass attendance.

Lawyers argue Trump's decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church. Rescinding the sensitive-locations memo, the lawsuit says, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which bars agencies from implementing policies that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”

What To Know Federal immigration agents took Osorio into custody after he dropped his son off at Lakewood Elementary School on September 4, according to the news outlet MLive.
""What triggered a lot of people is that it happened near the school,"" Osorio told MLive.
Both ICE and Ann Arbor Public Schools told MLive that federal authorities did not enter school grounds and no students witnessed agents taking Osorio.","Rodrigo Osorio, a 31-year-old father, was taken into federal immigration custody after he dropped his son off at a school in Ann Arbor, Michigan, last week.

Osorio, who was released later that day, was held in custody at an immigration facility in Detroit for about eight hours before his release, reports said.

Why It Matters

Policy changes under President Donald Trump's administration have loosened restrictions that previously required Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to obtain prior approval before arresting individuals at ""sensitive locations,"" such as schools, hospitals and churches.

According to critics, enforcement actions have since increased in and around those places. The incident in Ann Arbor mirrors other widely reported cases in which ICE agents have detained parents near schools, raising concerns among educators, parents and local officials about the potential emotional effects on children.

What To Know

Federal immigration agents took Osorio into custody after he dropped his son off at Lakewood Elementary School on September 4, according to the news outlet MLive.

He told the outlet that he was a block away from the school when he saw the lights of a few vehicles and pulled to the side to allow them to pass. But they stopped and apprehended him instead.

Osorio, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 7 and has lived most of his life in the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti areas of Michigan, has been protected from removal under DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, since 2012.

""What triggered a lot of people is that it happened near the school,"" Osorio told MLive. ""That they waited for me to drop my kid off and pick me up.""

""My kid is pretty traumatized out of this, I would say. He's been asking me, 'Are they gonna come pick you up again?' He asked, 'Who picked you up? What's going on?' And I don't think an 8-year-old should be concerned about [that].""

""It's just been pretty hard in a way,"" he added.

Osorio said he was never provided a reason for his detainment, adding that federal authorities ""kept changing up the story.""

Both ICE and Ann Arbor Public Schools told MLive that federal authorities did not enter school grounds and no students witnessed agents taking Osorio.

In a statement on Friday, an ICE spokesperson told MLive that Osorio was found ""not amenable to removal for the United States"" upon further review.

Federal officials said that claims of individuals being apprehended as part of broader, school-based ""raids"" were completely inaccurate. A Department of Homeland Security memo issued on Tuesday described such reports as ""fake news.""

""After media force-feeding the public stories about parents and children being scared to return to school, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is setting the record straight: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does NOT raid or target schools,"" the memo said.

It added that the DHS directive that allows ICE to go into schools ""gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs.""

""Our agents use discretion,"" the memo continued. ""Officers would need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a school. We expect these to be extremely rare.""

What People Are Saying

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: ""The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement. These smears are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing 1,000 percent increase in assaults against them. ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at, or 'raiding,' schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children.

""Criminals are no longer be able to hide in America's schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2718841/ice.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:57:45.418321

But its decision this week to lift a lower court injunction barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from conducting raids around Los Angeles by armed and masked agents engaged in racial profiling is among the most shameful.

Under these circumstances, the Court had every reason to doubt that Lyons needed the protection of a court order barring the future use of chokeholds against him.

But its decision this week to lift a lower court injunction barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from conducting raids around Los Angeles by armed and masked agents engaged in racial profiling is among the most shameful. In the context of affirmative action, this Court has piously opined: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Yet when it comes to immigration, the Court will allow ICE to proceed for now as if any brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking, low-wage worker in central California is reasonably suspected of being deportable.

The public owes Justice Brett Kavanaugh some gratitude for explaining his vote in concurrence with the majority; often, the Court’s “emergency” orders arrive simply as unsigned riddles. His opinion, however, is deeply unpersuasive. Still, it provides a service by presenting both the Court’s seemingly blinkered understanding of the practices in dispute and its disregard for the role of trial judges in fact-finding decisions.

The case in question, Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem in the lower courts, was filed as a potential class action brought by five individual plaintiffs and three membership organizations. They proved to the satisfaction of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that senior federal immigration officials working in and around Los Angeles had authorized ICE agents to stop and detain individuals for interrogation based entirely on four highly generalized factors: (1) their apparent race or ethnicity; (2) whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent; (3) the type of location at which they were found (such as a car wash or bus stop); and (4) the type of job they appeared to work. In other words, instead of responding to a “reasonable suspicion” that might legally justify individual stops, ICE was detaining people based on characteristics likely to describe a great many innocent people. Justice Sonia Sotomayor explains in her dissent that the Fourth Amendment does not allow stops based on criteria that broad. Yet in Central California, a judicial district where nearly half the population identifies as Latino or Hispanic, there are quite likely millions of U.S. citizens and fully documented alien residents whom such an indiscriminate, ethnicity-based filter would catch. The Ninth Circuit had already declined to stay the District Court’s injunction barring ICE’s practice, viewing the plaintiffs as likely to prevail after a full trial and judging that the government would suffer no irreparable harm while its four-factor searches were suspended.

Kavanaugh, to the contrary, argues that the government is likely to prevail on two issues. One is whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue—in other words, did their allegations raise a sufficient likelihood of imminent harm to warrant an injunction barring interrogation stops that have not yet occurred? But “standing” is a notoriously malleable doctrine, and the case Kavanaugh cites as relevant precedent for the government quite easily supports the opposite conclusion.

City of Los Angeles v. Lyons is a 1983 case involving a motorist stopped for a vehicle code violation. Despite offering no resistance to officers, Adolph Lyons was placed in a chokehold that rendered him unconscious and damaged his larynx. He sought both damages for his injury and an injunction against the use of chokeholds by the police. The Court said Lyons could sue for damages based on the actual chokehold, but not for an injunction against future police practices. Lyons, the majority concluded, had not proved “a sufficient likelihood that he [would] again be wronged” by the police employing excessive force.

Lyons and Vasquez Perdomo are fundamentally different. Because Lyons was suing only as an individual, speculation about future harm could focus only on him personally. The plaintiffs in Perdomo are asking the trial court to allow them to proceed as a class action on behalf of “[a]ll persons who, since June 6, 2025, have been or will be subjected to detentive stop by federal agents in the District without a pre-stop, individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion concerning whether the person (1) is engaged in an offense against the United States or (2) is a noncitizen unlawfully in the United States.” There are thousands, if not millions, of people whose futures are at stake.

Moreover, by the time Lyons’s case was heard in 1982, the Los Angeles Police Department had adopted a ban on “bar-arm chokeholds” and entered into a moratorium—since made permanent—against “carotid artery” holds, except in circumstances that would justify the use of lethal force. Under these circumstances, the Court had every reason to doubt that Lyons needed the protection of a court order barring the future use of chokeholds against him. As for Vasquez Perdomo, Justice Sotomayor describes the vastly different policy orientation at stake: “Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has called the District Judge an ‘idiot’ and vowed that ‘none of [the Government’s] operations are going to change.’ The CBP Chief Patrol Agent in the Central District has stated that his division will ‘turn and burn’ and ‘go even harder now,’ and has posted videos on social media touting his agents’ continued efforts, chasing, cuffing, [and] deporting’ people at car washes.” Against this background, any brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking Californian appearing to work in a low-wage occupation or even waiting for a bus has reasonable cause to fear being stopped by a federal agency running amok.

Kavanaugh suggests that the government will likely prevail on the argument that its four factors are sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion. After all, he argues, it is probable that many of the undocumented aliens in California come from Mexico or Central America, “do not speak much English,” and seek employment in a predictable set of jobs that “do not require paperwork.” None of this negates the fact, however, that without some additional factor—for example, the record of a particular employer in hiring undocumented persons—these elements alone are likely to describe a large percentage of the low-wage workforce in Central California, documented or not.

Finally, under Supreme Court precedent, emergency relief for the Trump administration should require a showing that the so-called balance of equities—weighing the harms caused to the government by the injunction versus the interests at stake for the defendants—is tilted in the government’s favor. In conducting his own balancing, Kavanaugh drastically minimizes the interests of the detained individuals. Undocumented persons who are detained, he claims, do not have any “especially weighty legal interest” in avoiding interrogation based on ICE’s criteria. Persons lawfully present, he says, face only “questioning” that is “typically brief.” They will “promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.” Unfortunately, the District Court record shows that the second of these claims is untrue. And Kavanaugh’s accounting does not acknowledge the reasonable fear and apprehension of millions of law-abiding Californians who fit the “suspect” criteria and are stigmatized by ICE’s policies.

In Trump v. Hawaii, the Court’s 2018 decision upholding the so-called “Muslim ban” imposed by the first Trump administration, Chief Justice Roberts took umbrage at the suggestion in a Sotomayor dissent that the majority was making an error of judgment akin to the Court’s infamous Korematsu decision. Yet one paragraph in the Kavanaugh opinion struck me as worthy of a similar rebuke. He writes: “To the extent that excessive force has been used, the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action … I agree with the dissent on that point. But … this injunction against brief stops for questioning does not address the use of force issue.”

Korematsu legitimized the decision of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration to place Japanese-Americans in internment camps because, the authorities claimed, it was too difficult to sort out the loyal from the disloyal as individuals. But Justices in the majority denied they were doing any such thing. Fred Korematsu had been convicted only of violating a so-called exclusion order, requiring him to leave the San Leandro area but not specifying where he was to go. The Court refused to “pass at this time upon the whole subsequent detention program in both assembly and relocation centers,” because “the only issues framed at the trial related to petitioner’s remaining in the prohibited area in violation of the exclusion order.” In other words, the majority could not be expected to recognize that Japanese-Americans were effectively being moved into internment camps by “excluding” them from everywhere except the camps themselves and where they would be assembled for transport.

Kavanaugh implicitly endorses a similar inattention. As Sotomayor wrote this week: “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.” Kavanaugh’s opinion implicitly asks readers to keep this reality outside their field of vision.

We do not know whether the five Justices other than Kavanaugh who are also content to leave ICE undisciplined are motivated by the standing issue, the Fourth Amendment issue, or a disinclination to confront the Trump administration in a case where it might choose outright defiance of the high court. But their unexplained votes do them no credit. As Sotomayor says, what the plaintiffs proved in the trial court about ICE’s conduct is “unconscionably irreconcilable with our Nation’s constitutional guarantees.” This Court is not meeting the challenge.",https://i0.wp.com/washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25212621113523-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1587&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-10 11:58:22.881837

“‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” Harris said.

“Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,” she continued. “The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”

The comments in Harris’ upcoming book “107 Days” mark her harshest criticism of the Bidens’ circle yet, laying bare divisions in the White House and grappling with the former president’s decision to seek a second term despite widespread concerns over his age.

Trump called this morning for the suspect accused of fatally stabbing a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, to face the death penalty.

""The ANIMAL who so violently killed the beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety, should be given a 'Quick' (there is no doubt!) Trial, and only awarded THE DEATH PENALTY. There can be no other option!!!"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., who's been accused of fatally stabbing Iryna Zarutska in August, was charged yesterday with the federal crime of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. The Department of Justice said that if convicted, he could either face life in prison without parole or the death penalty.

Court records show that Brown has a criminal history spanning more than a decade and some have questioned whether he has mental health issues.

Even before his second term began, Trump called for expanded use of the death penalty across the country. After he was sworn in, he signed an executive order that directed the attorney general to pursue the death penalty “for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.”

Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., are renewing their call for the U.S. to ramp up sanctions on Russia after its recent strike on Kyiv.

In a statement from the senators, who serve as co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, they said that Russia ""deliberately struck EU diplomatic facilities and other Western assets in Kyiv — a calculated provocation against America’s allies.""

They said that as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates the war in Ukraine, the U.S. ""appears to be cutting back"" certain programs, such as some that are ""lifelines for NATO’s eastern flank.""

""The message this sends is dangerous: that the United States is pulling back just as the stakes in Ukraine and for NATO’s security are at their highest,"" they said. ""Our adversaries are taking note that they can wait out American support — that does not make America safer.""

Poland also said earlier today that during an attack on Ukraine, Russian drones had entered theNATO countrty's airspace and were shot down.

The Senate Banking Committee will vote this morning on the nomination of Stephen Miran to fill a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.

Democrats have been demanding that he resign from his job as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers if he's confirmed by the Senate. Miran, however, testified last week that he plans only to take a leave of absence from his current job instead of resigning.

The Council of Economic Advisers is an agency within the White House that advises the president on economic policy, while the Federal Reserve is supposed to maintain independence within the government. If confirmed, Miran would hold a spot on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates and the Federal Reserve is soon expected to cut them.

Trump nominated Stephen Miran in August to fill the seat of Adriana Kugler, who resigned early from her 14-year term that expires in January. At that point, Miran would need to be re-nominated and re-confirmed in order to continue to serve on the board.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke with his Chinese counterpart via video teleconference from the Pentagon yesterday, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the call.

Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell later confirmed the call, saying the two officials ""exchanged views in a candid and constructive manner.""

""Secretary Hegseth made clear that the United States does not seek conflict with China nor is it pursuing regime change or strangulation of the PRC,"" Parnell said. ""At the same time, however, he forthrightly relayed that the U.S. has vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests.""

This is the first time Hegseth is known to have spoken with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun. There was potential for them to meet at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in May, but Dong did not attend, instead sending a delegation of other officials.

At the conference, Hegseth called on U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific to increase their defense spending to counter the threat from China.

“There’s no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,” Hegseth said.

Beijing criticized his speech, labeling it divisive.

Hegseth’s call with Dong comes just weeks before Trump could meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit in South Korea late next month.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican Vivek Ramaswamy has landed another labor endorsement in his bid to be Ohio’s next governor.

The Central Midwest Regional Council of Carpenters, which represents 37,000 trade workers in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky announced its support for the Trump-backed candidate today.

“The CMRCC appreciates your commitment and support to our member’s priorities and values,” Jason Clark, the group's senior political adviser, wrote in an endorsement letter to Ramaswamy that was shared first with NBC News. “Your leadership and dedication to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women we represent is well documented. We look forward to working with you and further strengthening our relationship.”

It’s the third union endorsement in recent weeks for Ramaswamy, an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2024 who later helped Trump and Elon Musk establish the federal Department of Government of Efficiency. In recent days the biotech entrepreneur has also secured support from the Northwest Ohio Building & Construction Trades Council and the Cleveland Building & Construction Trades Council.

“The carpenters, millwrights and skilled tradespeople of Ohio represent the engine that drives our economy,” Ramaswamy said in a statement shared by his campaign. “As governor, I will work to expand vocational training, partner with CMRCC on their priorities, and invest in infrastructure so that union workers and all Ohioans can thrive.”

The carpenters group has a mixed partisan record when it comes to endorsements. Last year, for example, the union backed Democrat Kamala Harris for president but Republican Mike Braun for governor of Indiana. In Ohio the union endorsed then-Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, in his unsuccessful re-election campaign. The carpenters also supported Democrat Tim Ryan in his unsuccessful 2022 Senate race against future Vice President JD Vance.

Ryan is considering a run for governor in 2026 and expects to make a decision in the coming weeks. Dr. Amy Acton, Ohio’s former health director, is already seeking the Democratic nomination. Incumbent Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is term-limited.

“The other side is still trying to get their partisan endorsements in order, trying to figure out who’s going to be running,” said Jai Chabria, Ramaswamy’s chief strategist.

Ramaswamy, he added, has “already unified the Republican Party, and is actually looking toward the general election, and he’s making very big inroads in to win there. And I am pretty proud of that right now.”

Trump told reporters last night that he plans to announce a crime crackdown in another city “probably tomorrow.”

He made the remarks as he was lauding his administration’s crackdown in Washington while he was going into dinner at tJoe’s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab in downtown D.C.

He added that he loved working with Democratic D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Pamela Smith. Fellow Democrats rebuked Bowser last month after she said crime in the district has gone down since Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement in the city.

A bipartisan group of staffers from the House Oversight Committee will travel to New York City today to meet with lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein’s estate and view unredacted versions of the documents the estate is turning over to the committee, according to a source familiar with the visit.

NBC News has reported that materials the estate is transmitting are redacted but that the committee staff members will be able to view the original unredacted versions in person.

“As agreed with the Committee, the Co-Executors will make the original ‘birthday book’ and unredacted versions of documents, records and other materials available to Committee members and their staff for their personal examination and review,” the lawyers for the Epstein estate wrote in their production cover letter to the committee yesterday.

The lawyers referred to the materials transmitted yesterday as the “first production of documents.”

House Oversight Committee staff to meet with Epstein estate lawyers and view unredacted docs, continued

Asked yesterday when the next batch of documents will be turned over, one of the lawyers, Daniel Weiner, told NBC News in a statement: “As agreed with the House Oversight Committee, the Estate is making a rolling production of documents responsive to the Committee’s subpoena. We hope to be producing additional documents soon.”

Trump’s rare outing to a local restaurant last night got off to a rocky start tonight when he came face to face with protesters.

Trump, accompanied by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other administration officials, arrived by motorcade at Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab less than a quarter-mile from the White House.

Trump briefly spoke to reporters on the street outside the restaurant, where he was met with cheers and some chants of “free Palestine.”

Once he was inside, as he greeted restaurant patrons, a group of protesters holding Palestinian flags began chanting, “Free D.C., free Palestine, Trump is the Hitler of our time.”

Democrat James Walkinshaw has won Virginia’s deep-blue 11th Congressional District, NBC News projects, an expected win for his party that adds another Democrat to the narrowly divided House of Representatives.

The seat that had been vacant since Rep. Gerry Connolly, who had esophageal cancer, died in May at age 75. Walkinshaw spent a decade as a top aide to Connolly.

Democrats will have 213 representatives in the House once Walkinshaw is sworn in, while Republicans have 219 representatives, with three seats still vacant because of deaths and resignations. A number of key votes loom on the horizon.

ICE agents arrested 57 illegal immigrants at a New York candy factory — including some accused of child endangerment, DUI and repeated illegal re-entries — in a raid that New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted as ""cruel.""

A Homeland Security spokesperson told Fox News Digital that an ICE workplace enforcement operation at Nutrition Bar Confectioners in Cato, New York, resulted in the arrests of 57 illegal aliens, including some with prior criminal convictions or pending charges, including child endangerment, DUI and multiple illegal re-entries.

The spokesperson said, ""These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets, and threaten American communities.""

Hochul, however, has said she is ""outraged"" by the workplace operations, which she said ""fly in the face of New York’s values.""

Hochul criticized the operation, saying that ""parents of at least a dozen children are at risk of returning from school to an empty house.""

""I’ve made it clear: New York will work with the federal government to secure our borders and deport violent criminals, but we will never stand for masked ICE agents separating families and abandoning children,"" Hochul said in a statement.

""Today’s raids will not make New York safer. What they did was shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here, just like millions of immigrants before them,"" she said. ""These actions fly in the face of New York’s values. As governor, I will always stand against this cruelty.""

Despite the criticism from Hochul and other Democrats, the DHS spokesperson called worksite enforcement ""a cornerstone of our efforts to protect public safety, national security, and economic stability while rescuing individuals who may be victims of labor trafficking or exploitation.""

""The employment of illegal aliens also incentivizes dangerous and illegal practices, including social security fraud,"" the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson pointed to a recent worksite operation at a meatpacking plant in Omaha, Nebraska, which they said is evidence that ""many illegal aliens use stolen social security numbers and identities to unlawfully obtain wages, health benefits and employment authorization.""

Fox News Digital previously covered the Omaha operation, which resulted in the arrest of 70 illegal aliens who were working at the plant using stolen Social Security numbers and identities to unlawfully obtain employment authorization, wages and benefits at the expense of over 100 American victims.

ICE officials told Fox News Digital that among those victimized by the mass identity theft scheme was a full-time nursing student who lost their college tuition assistance because it was fraudulently reported that they earned too much money due to an illegal alien using their Social Security number.

While the arrests sparked protests from some in both the local community and nationally, ICE said the illegal aliens’ identity theft proves they were not innocent, hardworking members of society, as some have suggested.

According to data released by the White House, there have been more than 2,100 arrests from August 7, when federal law enforcement began their deployment, through September 8.
Last week, in a nod to continued collaboration, she issued an order to continue the work of an emergency operations center the city set up in response to the federal law enforcement surge.
Asked about future plans, a White House spokeswoman said the details of the continued law enforcement involvement “are subject to change to meet law enforcement needs as the operation continues.” James Nolan, professor of sociology at West Virginia University, said it remained to be seen whether the influx of law enforcement is sustainable or addresses underlying problems.
If only aggressive policing is used, it most likely will bring frustration and conflict between the community and law enforcement, he said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — One month after President Donald Trump’s law enforcement surge in the nation’s capital, there may be less crime. There are fewer guns on the streets and fewer homeless encampments, according to official figures. But for some who work or live in Washington, D.C., the operation has sparked fear and prompted a change in how they see their place in the United States — and how they think the United States sees them.

Without an extension by Congress, the 30-day emergency declaration issued by President Trump that federalized the district’s police force expires Wednesday. The National Guard deployment continues, at least for now.

With Trump now setting his sights on Chicago and Baltimore, all eyes are on the District on Columbia and how it emerges from this unprecedented takeover.

Here are some takeaways from the emergency period:

Crime appears to have gone down. But it was already falling

The president has lauded his surge as a resounding success. But reality is less clear cut.

According to data released by the White House, there have been more than 2,100 arrests from August 7, when federal law enforcement began their deployment, through September 8.

The White House says those include 20 suspected gang members, including several from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua groups. In addition, 222 firearms have been seized and 50 homeless encampments dismantled, according to the White House.

Metropolitan Police Department figures show that violent crime during the surge was down 39% from the same period last year, including a 53% drop in homicides, with seven during the surge, compared to 15 during the same timespan in 2024.

The roughly 2,000 guard members from D.C. and seven states have largely patrolled Metro stations and the main transit hub, Union Station, while occasionally cleaning up litter.

Brian Levin, professor emeritus of criminal justice at California State University, San Bernardino, said crime was already in decline according to a report issued in January by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. The surge likely intensified that, although it is hard to say by how much, he said.

“D.C. is one of the smaller cities in the United States. It’s easier to police,” Levin said. “This might not work elsewhere.”

For Trump, projecting a tough on crime image may be helping him politically, at least for the moment. His overall approval rating increased slightly, from 40% in July to 45% a month later, according to an AP-NORC poll from late August, at a time when 81% of Americans see crime as a “major problem” in large cities.

D.C.’s mayor caught between Trump and her voters

Mayor Muriel Bowser has mostly avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks against the president that has been typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders.

Instead, she cooperated with the administration’s efforts, including having MPD officers work more closely with federal immigration agents, as Trump has demanded. Last week, in a nod to continued collaboration, she issued an order to continue the work of an emergency operations center the city set up in response to the federal law enforcement surge.

She also backed up the administration’s claims on the success of the surge. Bowser said crime was falling before Trump issued the emergency order. But she acknowledged the federal surge had a “significant” impact on crime.

Speaking at a press conference on Aug. 27, the mayor said that carjackings were down 87% since the same 20-day period last year.

“We know that when carjackings go down, when use of guns goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So, this surge has been important to us for that reason.”

Her approach is a stark contrast to other, more oppositional Democratic leaders in Chicago or L.A. It highlights how much D.C. is subject to the whims of the federal government. The district is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973 but federal political leaders retain significant control over local affairs, including the approval of the budget and laws passed by the D.C council. Republicans, who control both chambers, have already frozen more than $1 billion in local spending, slashing the city’s budget in the middle of the financial year.

City council members, however, have shown less restraint, and were fiercely critical of the surge. Last week, the district, led by its elected attorney general, asked a federal court to intervene in the takeover, which it called a “forced military occupation.”

The nation’s capital is taking stock of its future

If, as anticipated, the emergency is not extended by Congress, the MPD will no longer be under the president’s authority and participating in federal operations, like immigration roundups.

“The MPD is not compelled to provide MPD services as directed by the president. That’s what changes,” Bowser said on Monday. “Shooting somebody? Still illegal. Committing carjackings? Still illegal. Stealing from stores? Still illegal. That won’t change on September 11. It will be illegal.”

In practical terms, what citizens see might not change much. D.C. guard members’ orders have been extended through December, and they are under the president’s direct command, unlike in the states where governors command their National Guard contingents. Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said he plans to send another 300 guard members to D.C. in the coming weeks to support law enforcement.

Asked about future plans, a White House spokeswoman said the details of the continued law enforcement involvement “are subject to change to meet law enforcement needs as the operation continues.”

James Nolan, professor of sociology at West Virginia University, said it remained to be seen whether the influx of law enforcement is sustainable or addresses underlying problems.

“Things that are related to crime are also related to physical and mental and emotional health issues,” he said. If only aggressive policing is used, it most likely will bring frustration and conflict between the community and law enforcement, he said.

The surge may have damaged community relationships

The takeover, with uniformed and armed Guardsmen patrolling Metro stations, tourist sites and neighborhoods, unnerved many residents. In one storied D.C. neighborhood with a traditionally high crime rate, residents felt they wanted more law enforcement, but not the kind Trump had deployed, especially as it came with the use of masked ICE officers taking people into custody.

“What relationships do we have to repair once this surge is over?” asked senior police commander Jaron Hickman.

At a protest Saturday against the surge that drew thousands, two women, both immigrants, said fear stemming from the surge was alienating the community.

Laura, 43, who migrated from Mexico 25 years ago, said she has encountered immigration enforcement officers three times in the past month, most recently at a checkpoint on one of the city’s main thoroughfares, New York Avenue. A restaurant worker, she said avoided them by taking a side street.

Guadalupe, 49, who like Laura, did not want to share her last name or be photographed out of fear of retribution, said she tried to get her grown children to come to the protest but they were wary. “They are American but they have Latino faces,” she said, adding that she came to the U.S. from El Salvador when she was 18.

“I’m legal in this country, but still I’m a scared because I have a Latino face,” she said. “I feel we don’t have any rights in this country anymore.”

In San Diego, ICE agents began arresting people in immigration court on May 22.
Courthouse arrests are part of a larger legal strategy meant to speed up Trump’s mass deportation campaign.","A San Diego law firm filed a class action lawsuit late last week asking a federal judge to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from arresting asylum seekers at immigration court.

“We’re asking the judge to declare that the agency’s behavior is unlawful,” said Kimberly Hutchison, a civil rights lawyer with locally based Singleton Schreiber.

The firm filed the suit on behalf of two asylum seekers who were arrested at San Diego’s immigration court earlier this year. The class action argues that courthouse arrests violate the constitutional rights of asylum seekers and delegitimize the integrity of the legal process.

“You can’t just take away someone’s liberty without giving the process to determine whether that is an appropriate decision,” Hutchison said. “They are doing it across the board and that’s a violation of due process.”

The class, as defined in the lawsuit, is limited to people actively seeking asylum who do not have a criminal record and have already been determined not to be a flight or public safety risk.

Neither of the two asylum seekers identified in the lawsuit have a criminal record. They also regularly attended all their immigration court hearings, Hutchison said.

“These are the quintessential people that can be trusted to remain out in the community,” she added.

Aside from claiming to erode trust in the immigration court system, lawyers argue courthouse arrests are traumatizing to their clients by subjecting them to unnecessary detention.

ICE did not respond to questions from KPBS about the lawsuit.

An abrupt change in policy

During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) explicitly prohibited courthouse arrests.

According to a 2021 memo, the agency explained its rationale against courthouse arrests, “so as to not unnecessarily impinge upon the core principle of preserving access to justice.” The memo explicitly defined a “courthouse” as any municipal, county, state, federal, tribal, or immigration court.

But in January, Trump administration officials suspended the 2021 memorandum and a separate Biden-era policy against arresting individuals in sensitive areas like schools, hospitals and courthouses.

In San Diego, ICE agents began arresting people in immigration court on May 22.

Courthouse arrests are part of a larger legal strategy meant to speed up Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

The strategy involves government lawyers asking immigration judges to dismiss immigration cases of people who have been in the country less than two years. Once those cases are dismissed, ICE agents can rearrest those individuals and place them in a fast-track deportation process called expedited removal.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/571e6d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F49%2F2ffd762449058a780baad510c9a4%2Fice-in-hallway.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:57:31.310923

Abraham died in a hit-and-run on Jan. 9 in Urbana, Ill., after an alleged drunk driver, who police say was undocumented, hit the 20-year-old’s vehicle with an SUV.

After talks with the city, the Justice Department issued an order listing the services that the Trump administration was demanding, chiefly involving immigration enforcement.
Days after Mr. Trump’s announcement, the D.C. police chief, Pamela A. Smith, issued an order to her department, outlining the extent to which officers could cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.
For her to publicly reassure immigrants in the city, he said, would risk triggering a new round of intervention from the Trump administration.
Two days later, she declined to offer unequivocal support when Mr. Schwalb sued the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.","One month ago, President Trump declared that “crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor” in Washington, D.C., represented such a dire emergency that he was placing the local police department “under direct federal control.” The announcement, coming a year and a half into a steady decline in D.C.’s violent crime rates, was one of the most aggressive encroachments on Washington’s self-government since Congress passed the D.C. Home Rule Act more than five decades ago.

At the stroke of midnight on Wednesday, that particular intervention will end. The 30-day window that temporarily grants presidents great powers in the city’s affairs will come to a close, a moment that city officials and many residents have been looking to as a sort of deliverance after four surreal weeks.

But it is unclear how much, if anything, will immediately change.

The end of the 30-day period has no bearing on the thousands of National Guard troops, drawn from the District of Columbia itself and from eight Republican-led states, who have been deployed to Washington. Neither does it directly affect the hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers — from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies — who have been sent out into the city to patrol. And U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will continue to take people into custody around Washington, as they did long before the emergency was declared.

Congress is marking the last day of the emergency by taking up a range of legislation that would eat away at D.C.’s self-government, including bills that would expand federal oversight, cancel local laws and eliminate some locally elected positions. (Although the district has about 500,000 eligible voters, they do not have congressional representation.)

For now, the specter of ever-greater federal control over the city, even if it has loomed particularly large over the past month, is going nowhere.

“With this administration and this particular crop of individuals in the Congress, you give an inch, they will take a mile,” said Christina Henderson, a member at large of the District of Columbia Council. “This is a group of people that require you to have your head on a swivel at all times.”

The Wednesday night deadline pertains only to presidential authority over local police, as detailed in the 1973 Home Rule Act, and even this authority is not as comprehensive as the White House has claimed.

The Trump administration was never actually able to take over the Metropolitan Police Department, though Mr. Trump and Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, declared their intention to do so. Days after the announcement, Brian Schwalb, the elected D.C. attorney general, filed a lawsuit arguing that the law didn’t give presidents the authority to take full control of the police department, only the authority to direct the mayor to provide certain police services for a declared federal emergency.

Facing hostile questions from a federal judge, the administration backed down from its broadest claims to power. After talks with the city, the Justice Department issued an order listing the services that the Trump administration was demanding, chiefly involving immigration enforcement.

That is one of the few things that will be different, on paper at least, on Thursday: The local police, whose cooperation with federal immigration enforcement is strictly limited under D.C. law, will no longer be compelled to cooperate with ICE.

But police operations on the ground might not change right away. Days after Mr. Trump’s announcement, the D.C. police chief, Pamela A. Smith, issued an order to her department, outlining the extent to which officers could cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

Tom Lynch, a spokesman for the police department, said that the order currently remains in place, and he declined to comment on what might happen after the deadline.

Phil Mendelson, the chairman of the D.C. Council, said he believed that the degree of police cooperation with ICE would wind down, though not at the stroke of midnight. “I think what we’re going to see is a slow and gradual transition,” he said. “I don’t think there will be a night-and-day separation.”

People who work with local immigrant communities said that the involvement of local police with ICE over the past month had undone years of community work by city officials.

“D.C. has made a lot of great efforts to have a Latino liaison,” said Abel Núñez, the executive director of Carecen, a social services organization for Latino immigrants. Police reassured immigrants that they could safely report domestic abuse or come forward with witness accounts about violent crime, he said. Now, “it’ll take years to rebuild that trust.”

Mr. Núñez said he expected that city leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, would probably not begin repairing that break right away. For her to publicly reassure immigrants in the city, he said, would risk triggering a new round of intervention from the Trump administration.

“She’s measuring what’s best for the overall city from her perspective,” he said. “That means that as immigrants we are left in a very vulnerable situation.”

Republicans in Congress are set to discuss more than a dozen bills concerning the District of Columbia on Wednesday, some of them seeking to permanently expand the federal government’s already considerable power over the city. Even without new legislation, the ability of the city to run its affairs remains precarious: Earlier this year, House Republicans declined to insert a routine clause pertaining to Washington in a budget resolution, leaving D.C. with a $1.1 billion funding shortfall.

There is also a lingering fear among D.C. officials, usually raised in whispers, that the president could simply decide to declare another emergency at any time, starting a new 30-day window of federal intrusion.

Mayor Bowser has said repeatedly that the city’s vulnerability required her to be strategic in dealing with the administration, a stance that has drawn criticism from residents and other elected officials who are urging a more confrontational stance. Last week, she announced the formation of a “Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center” to help coordinate with the federal law enforcement agencies — not including ICE — that have sent officers to do police work in the city. Two days later, she declined to offer unequivocal support when Mr. Schwalb sued the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.

“My 100 percent focus is on exiting the emergency,” the mayor said to reporters when asked about the lawsuit. “That’s where all of our energies are.”

Furthermore, data matching in elections is notoriously difficult and there are questions about the completeness of the Social Security Administration's citizenship data USCIS is relying on.","Tens of millions of voters have had their citizenship status and other information checked using a revamped tool offered by the Trump administration, even as many states — led by both Democrats and Republicans — are refusing or hesitating to use it because of outstanding questions about the system.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) says election officials have used the tool to check the information of more than 33 million voters — a striking portion of the American public, considering little information has been made public about the tool's accuracy or data security.

The latest update to the system, known as SAVE, took effect Aug. 15 and allows election officials to use just the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers — along with names and dates of birth — to check if the voters are U.S. citizens, or if they have died.

The upgrade makes the tool far more accessible, since it now aligns with the information most states collect or have access to for most voters. But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which houses USCIS, has not responded to questions about the system from members of Congress, and numerous election officials NPR spoke with expressed concern about what else the Trump administration could do with the data it acquires from states.

""There's still uncertainty about what is happening, what happens to the data that are shared with USCIS,"" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor who directs the MIT Election Data and Science Lab. ""I don't know if this means that the USCIS now has a depository of one-sixth of all [the country's] registered voters.""

In recent months, several Republican-led states have brokered new agreements with USCIS to use SAVE, or announced the results of SAVE reviews. Ohio election officials will begin removing from their rolls thousands of inactive voters that SAVE identified as deceased. And Louisiana's secretary of state announced last week that officials identified 79 likely noncitizens who had voted in at least one election since the 1980s, after running nearly all of the state's 2.9 million registered voters through SAVE.

DHS is encouraging officials in other states to upload data to the system — even going so far as to make millions of dollars of grant money contingent on them using it.

But USCIS did not respond to NPR's questions about what happens to the data states upload and who has access to it.

And officials in other GOP-led states have expressed caution about using the system.

Last month, North Carolina's Republican-controlled state election board did not take up an offer by USCIS to participate in a ""soft launch"" of the upgraded tool. Spokesperson Patrick Gannon told NPR in a statement that state officials are pursuing ""agreements to ensure that proper safeguards would be in place to protect and secure the data, if a decision is ultimately made to use the service.""

Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, a Republican, told NPR the upgraded SAVE seemed like a ""fantastic tool,"" but he still has questions before he can run his voter list through it to ensure it is authorized under state law.

""Where's that data going? And at the end of the day, is it stored? What are they going to do with it? Who has access? Is it shared?"" Watson told NPR last month. ""I don't want to do something that I don't necessarily have the ability to do without legislative authority. So we just want to be very clear on that before we move forward.""

SAVE concerns are compounded by other Trump moves on elections

The push for states to use the upgraded data system comes as the Trump administration is taking unprecedented steps to assert control over elections as well as collect and aggregate personal data on Americans — at times potentially risking the security of that data.

Numerous voting officials told NPR they felt the revamped SAVE tool could be useful for confirming citizenship status without encumbering voters, and many Democrats also acknowledged the efforts by Trump's USCIS to work in a bipartisan fashion.

But concerns about SAVE are compounded by other moves by President Trump's administration. Trump continues to make baseless claims about widespread noncitizen voting, has attempted to change voter registration rules to include proof-of-citizenship requirements, and has directed the Justice Department to prioritize prosecuting noncitizens who register or vote. DHS also recently elevated a person who spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election to a post on election integrity.

As part of the administration's stated aim to crack down on noncitizen voting, USCIS prioritized updating the data system known as Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, that state and federal agencies have for decades used to query DHS databases to determine if foreign-born individuals are eligible for various benefits.

The agency, working with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, made SAVE free to states and allowed bulk searches, as opposed to looking up one person at a time — changes that were celebrated by many voting officials.

""It's getting access to data that already exists and just making it so [election officials] can more easily compare things without making it hard for voters,"" said Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican who has begun testing out SAVE's upgraded capabilities. ""I'm trying to make it easier for voters while also doing these validations.""

In May, USCIS linked data from the Social Security Administration, allowing election officials for the first time to check the citizenship of many U.S.-born citizens with the voter's name, date of birth and nine-digit Social Security number. NPR was the first news outlet to report on the change.

The integration with Social Security Administration data also means SAVE can show if someone appears on that agency's Death Master File.

Since most states only collect the last four digits of Social Security numbers from voters, the latest upgrade swung open the door for many more states to use SAVE. USCIS says almost 80% of the 33 million voters validated via SAVE were run through the system since the Aug. 15 change.

An unprecedented push for voter data

In mid-July, California Sen. Alex Padilla and two other Democratic U.S. senators formally requested information on the updated SAVE system from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, including the accuracy rate of the SAVE program, what data USCIS stores and who has access, and whether the agency is following protocols spelled out in federal privacy laws.

The senators asked for answers by July 29 but have not heard back.

""In light of the president's threats to issue unconstitutional executive orders to interfere with state elections, DHS owes Congress and the public some basic transparency about what they are doing with state voter rolls,"" Padilla told NPR.

SAVE pings a number of data sources, as opposed to being a database in and of itself. But under USCIS policy, all queries are saved for 10 years for audit purposes, so if a state runs its whole voter list through the tool, that data will remain with DHS for a decade.

Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, told NPR that such a system sounded like the beginnings of a national voter registration list that would raise privacy and security concerns.

""They said they're going to keep our data for 10 years,"" Bellows said. ""If [former Attorney General] Merrick Garland were asking for this or President Biden, I have to think that the red states would be calling for their heads.""

The agreements that states sign to use SAVE include a clause that grants DHS permission to use information from states ""for any purpose permitted by law, including, but not limited to, the prosecution of violations of Federal administrative or criminal law.""

At a White House meeting about SAVE in late July, USCIS officials tried to reassure state voting officials about sharing sensitive voter data, according to Connecticut Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas, who attended the meeting.

""They said many times like, 'Look, we know the states are in charge of elections. We don't want your data. We don't want your lists,' "" Thomas recalled.

But in recent weeks, the Department of Justice has been making controversial demands to numerous states to turn over such data, including in several instances voter rolls that include personal data like driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.

Thomas, a Democrat, said that when a Republican secretary of state pointed out the DOJ's voter data demands to USCIS officials, the officials responded that they worked for a separate agency.

""The worst thing you can get is a false positive""

USCIS hasn't publicized detailed evidence about the accuracy of the tool or shared what testing went into the program before it was released to states, though it asserts SAVE's accuracy has markedly improved with the recent upgrades.

But voting rights groups and some election officials are voicing concerns that eligible voters could face barriers to casting ballots or be improperly removed from the rolls if states over-rely on incomplete information from SAVE.

USCIS acknowledges that certain categories of people who acquired U.S. citizenship, such as some foreign-born children of U.S. citizens, cannot be verified by SAVE.

Furthermore, data matching in elections is notoriously difficult and there are questions about the completeness of the Social Security Administration's citizenship data USCIS is relying on.

Wesley Wilcox, a Republican elections supervisor in Marion County, Fla., signed an agreement this summer giving his county access to SAVE. But he said he plans to double check any data he gets from the system, since he's encountered multiple instances in which SSA data indicated a person was dead when they weren't.

""It's like any new process that you put into effect … we're going to do that legwork,"" Wilcox said. ""I want to be as accurate as humanly possible at all times.""

For a portion of foreign-born individuals, SAVE prompts user agencies to submit more information, such as a person's naturalization certificate number or alien registration number, for their case to be manually reviewed. USCIS told NPR that of the 33 million voters submitted to the upgraded SAVE so far, less than 1% have required that manual review. The agency did not respond to NPR's question about the results of the manual review, how many noncitizens on voter rolls have been identified to date or what portion of the results so far were inconclusive.

While USCIS' materials say election officials are not supposed to reject voter registrations or remove voters from the rolls if the SAVE system asks for more voter information, it is not yet clear if there are consequences if states skip those steps.

Last year, thousands of U.S. citizens in states including Alabama, Virginia and Texas were removed from the rolls or deactivated after election officials relied on imperfect data to identify suspected noncitizens.

Conservative election integrity advocates have broadly celebrated SAVE's development, but among some, there is also an acknowledgement that states need to be cautious when removing people from voter rolls.

""I am hopeful that a great deal of care and a great deal of contemplation is going into this process because the worst thing you can get is a false positive,"" said J. Christian Adams, president of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation. ""The worst thing you could do, as some states have done in the past, is remove a citizen from the voter rolls as a noncitizen. That should not happen.""

In 2019, a court settlement required Adams to apologize to a group of Virginia voters his organization incorrectly claimed were noncitizens.

Louisiana's test case

The most in-depth data about how the updated SAVE is working came last week from Louisiana.

The state's Republican secretary of state, Nancy Landry, told reporters that by using SAVE, her office identified 390 people on the voter rolls who they believe are noncitizens. Seventy-nine of them were found to have voted. Landry said there was a review of each suspected noncitizen and her office worked with the FBI to investigate their citizenship status.

""They have been given notice we have reason to believe they are not a U.S. citizen,"" Landry said. ""They have the opportunity to come in and provide documentation that they are in fact a U.S. citizen.""

Anyone who does not respond or provide proof within 21 days is removed from the rolls, Landry said, and noncitizens who registered to vote — regardless of whether they were among the 79 who voted in recent decades — will be referred for criminal prosecution.

The number of suspected noncitizens Louisiana found to have voted amounts to less than 0.003% of the state's registered voters, a percentage that aligns with what many other reviews on the issue have found.

""The very small numbers suggest that the results are what we expected, and that they are not alarming,"" said Stewart of MIT.

He added that number might shrink further as some people may prove to be citizens.

Yet even as there are signs the SAVE program is generating helpful data, Stewart said it is troubling that USCIS is withholding answers to key questions, like what happens to the data that is uploaded or detailed breakdowns on SAVE results so far.

In Minnesota, state voting officials would need a change to state law to use SAVE for elections. But Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, said he won't push for such a change until he has more clarity on how it works.

""Certainly it's impressive what they've done in a short period of time,"" Simon said. ""[But] I'd want to see a lot more by way of testing and assurances about the accuracy before we would be a willing and enthusiastic participant.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1862x1047+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F5f%2F8d0f150b4ac29e3bb41c336d28f7%2Fgettyimages-2182415974.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 06:56:35.547531

That will not change the course of events that is to follow, however, because Gregorio Cordova Murrieta is to remain behind bars while he awaits a likely deportation.

U.S. District Court Judge Micah Smith sentenced Cordova, who pleaded guilty in August to illegal re-entry, to time served — the 76 days he has already spent at the Federal Detention Center on Elliott Street in Honolulu.

Smith said that all the factors he considered, from Cordova’s motivation for unlawfully crossing the border to his stellar conduct in the community, “overwhelmingly weigh in favor of time served.” The maximum sentence he could have faced was two years in prison, and a fine of as much as $250,000.

Cordova — who was not charged with any other crime and Smith noted has no past criminal record — was to be placed directly into the custody of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE.

On Tuesday, the judge spent several minutes reading aloud portions of letters submitted to the court in support of Cordova.

From a U.S. soldier grievously wounded in combat in Iraq whom Cordova helped to recover enough to play soccer again. From another wounded combat veteran who said Cordova had been “instrumental in my mental wellbeing.” From his fiancée’s children, who called him a “source of joy, companionship, and stability” for their mother and “an example of resilience.” From clients in his tile setting and countertop business who called his workmanship “first class” and described him as a “benefit to our economy who filled a need for honest and trustworthy workers.”

Letter after letter, Smith said, “showed that you have made a very significant impact on others who lived here.”

In the Aha Kaulike courtroom, or Place of Equity, the judge gave Cordova the opportunity to speak before being sentenced. He asked for forgiveness from Hawaiʻi’s governor, the judge and prosecutors for illegally entering the state and country.

He then turned to about a dozen family and friends. They were crying and so was he.

“I’d like to thank all my family,” he said through an interpreter, “and ask their forgiveness for putting them through this.”

Traced Through Transfers

Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, traced Cordova’s whereabouts through records of his money transfer transactions, according to the criminal complaint they filed in the case. Experts said it was the first time they were aware of those kinds of records being used to investigate cases related to solely immigration-related offenses.

Civil Beat story Immigrant Sent Cash To Family In Mexico; ICE Used That To Nab Him On Oʻahu

They said the government’s access to the records most likely came through a database maintained by the nonprofit Transaction Record Analysis Center, or TRAC, to which companies such as Western Union and MoneyGram have submitted transaction data since at least 2014. It was first set up to help investigators track money laundering, drug trafficking and other such crimes.

TRAC was established following a 2010 settlement between the Arizona Attorney General’s Office and Western Union, which was required to send information about transfers over $500 — including details that identify the sender — to the nonprofit.

Immigration attorneys said Cordova’s ability to seek asylum or take any other measures to try to persuade authorities to allow him to stay in the country where he has lived for approximately 17 years, is extremely limited.

“He is going to be definitely handed to ICE to deport him almost immediately,” said Neribel Chardon, senior staff attorney at The Legal Clinic, a nonprofit that represents immigrants. “That is what’s going to happen.”

The only hitch, Chardon said, is if Cordova does not have a current passport or travel documents, in which case ICE would work with the Mexican government to obtain them before sending him back.

Cordova’s fiancée, Grace Perez Parra of ʻAiea, said that at this point he just wants to go see his parents and children, who live in a rural region of Puebla state. They were the ones he was helping support with proceeds from his work on Oʻahu.

She said Cordova, in their most recent telephone conversation, said: “Mama, I just want people to know I’m not a criminal.”

Parra said she is going to try and contact an immigration attorney to see whether Cordova could be allowed to return to the United States at some point.

“If I can, I’m going to try, but if not, then I’ll just go there,” she said. “It’s sad, you know, but I can’t do anything about it, right? You just got to go with the law.”

Having the illegal reentry conviction on his record is almost certainly “a permanent bar” to Cordova ever being granted legal permission to return, Chardon said.

According to court documents, Cordova, now 48, had been detained at the U.S.-Mexican border in 2004 and sent back to Mexico. Then, within the space of a few days in 2008, he was detained and sent back twice more.

Federal investigators who located him in Honolulu through details collected in the MoneyGram transactions staked out his house and used an anonymous source to confirm his identity. Shortly after dawn on June 26, they banged on his and Parra’s front door and arrested him.

Cordova originally pleaded not guilty to the charge of illegal reentry but changed his plea to guilty in August because, Parra said, he just wanted to see his family in Mexico again.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2024/02/03103523/230201-dc-Federal-Court-7214.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:56:40.707065

Roberts wrote “that the September 3, 2025 order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, case Nos.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Trump administration can temporarily hold on to $4 billion in foreign aid funding approved by Congress, overturning a lower court’s order and continuing a struggle over who controls the nation’s purse strings.

The one-page ruling from the emergency docket, signed by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., came just one day after the administration appealed the lower court’s ruling.

While the original lawsuit over withheld foreign aid began in February and stemmed from an executive order, the Trump administration sent Congress a rescissions request covering some of the spending in late August.

The proposal is part of the formal process laid out in a 1974 law that allows the president to ask lawmakers to cancel previously approved spending.

Congress typically has 45 days to approve, modify, or disagree with a rescissions request. During that time the president can legally freeze the funding and only has to spend it if lawmakers don’t approve the plan.

This particular rescission request, however, was sent to lawmakers within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year, creating a dispute that complicated the nature of the original lawsuit.

That maneuver, sometimes called a pocket rescission, is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and several members of Congress, though White House budget director Russ Vought believes it's within the bounds of the law.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Trump administration’s appeal that the federal district court’s order to spend the funding “requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself.”

“Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients,” he added.

The Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday doesn’t address whether the justices agree with the administration that it can refuse to spend the billions in foreign aid since it sent the rescissions request close to the end of the fiscal year.

Roberts wrote “that the September 3, 2025 order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, case Nos. 1:25-cv-400 and 1:25-cv-402, is hereby partially stayed for funds that are subject to the President’s August 28, 2025 recission proposal currently pending before Congress pending further order of the undersigned or of the Court.

Administration officials have no right to threaten people with legal action just for recording ICE officers in Chicago.","CHICAGO – In a story published today by the Center for Media and Democracy, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin is quoted as saying that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents,” adding that “(w)e will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.” The statement follows a similar sentiment expressed by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this summer, a statement in which she described recording video of ICE officers as “violence.”

The statements by DHS’ officials run directly contrary to court rulings, including ACLU v. Alvarez, a case defending the ability of an individual to record a public official doing their public duty in a public space. In January 2012, a federal appeals court in Chicago made clear that the public has a First Amendment right to gather information about the behavior of public officials, disseminate this information to the public, and present it to courts and government agencies to hold government accountable for their actions.

No statements from DHS can reverse this court decision or cancel First Amendment rights.

In light of the report and stepped-up immigration enforcement actions in the Chicago area, the ACLU of Illinois issued a statement making clear what the law is when it comes to recording public officials – including ICE agents – operating in a public space. The following can be attributed to Edwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy, at the

American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois:

More than a decade ago, we fought to ensure that the public could safely record law enforcement engaged in their public duties in a public space without fear of prosecution. That right – protected by the First Amendment – is settled law. And it allows community members to record Donald Trump and Kristi Noem’s reckless and cruel immigration enforcement policies – marked by masked, heavily-armed agents careening through our streets without any identification. Government spokespeople cannot diminish that right by mischaracterizing recording as “violence” or “doxxing.” This is the public holding the Administration accountable – something this Administration dislikes.

To be clear, if you witness ICE activity in our community, you have the right to record a federal officer in public – including those engaged in immigration enforcement. The ACLU of Illinois encourages people recording those interactions to do so from a safe distance that does not obstruct the activity. Administration officials have no right to threaten people with legal action just for recording ICE officers in Chicago. It is just one more attempt to coerce and intimidate our community.",https://www.aclu-il.org/profiles/aclu_affiliates/themes/custom/affiliates/favicons/favicon-32x32.png?v=3.0,N,,2025-09-10 11:58:03.170309

Their work is cut out for them. Agents have raided the lot outside the 108,000 square-foot Home Depot store in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles at least five times since June, rounding up some immigrants and sending others running in search of safety.

Home Depot stores in Southern California have long been an informal job-seeking hub for day laborers in the country both legally and illegally. Now the locations have become a prime target for immigration agents.

In fact, Home Depot was reportedly mentioned as a target for immigration raids by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, earlier this year.

At least a dozen Home Depot stores have been targeted, some of them repeatedly, in Southern California since the administration stepped up its immigration crackdown this summer.

Immigrant advocates sued over the raids but on Monday the Supreme Court cleared the way for federal agents to continue conducting sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for the Trump administration at the high court. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it “a win” for the rule of law, while advocates swiftly criticized the ruling.

“When you undermine the civil rights of those who are more vulnerable, you undermine the civil rights of everyone else,"" Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said Monday during a press conference held near a Home Depot.

Last month, outside a Home Depot in Monrovia, a man ran onto a nearby freeway to flee immigration authorities, and was struck and killed.

The Van Nuys location has been hit particularly hard.

Escaping three raids

Javier, a 52-year-old Mexican immigrant who has lived in U.S. states spanning from California to Kansas over the past three decades, said he narrowly escaped three raids at the store, avoiding agents by hiding beneath a truck, peeling off in his car and dashing inside among the busy shoppers.

“They come in big vans and they all go out to chase people,” he said in Spanish, asking that his last name not be used out of fear of government reprisal.

The store sits on property near the Van Nuys Airport that is owned by Los Angeles World Airports, a department in a city whose policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that her office supports the litigation against the sweeps and has trained city workers to prepare for immigration enforcement on city-owned properties.

City councilperson Ysabel Jurado has voiced opposition to a plan for a new Home Depot in her district, contending the company hasn’t done enough to fight the raids.

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said “these locations should be protected by the city to the same degree the public libraries are.""

In response to questions about raids at Home Depot stores, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement Tuesday that the agency has made more than 5,400 arrests in the Los Angeles area since early June and is targeting immigrants based on their legal status, not their ethnicity.

“Every day, DHS is enforcing our nation’s laws across all of Los Angeles, not just Home Depot,” she said.

Contractors make up about half its business

Immigrant advocates say the country’s largest big-box home improvement retailer benefits from having an ample labor pool at the ready for contractors and should do more to protect customers, employees and day laborers.

The Atlanta-based company, with nearly $160 billion in annual sales through Feb. 2, counts on contractors and professionals for about half its business — and that's a key draw for largely immigrant-day laborers. Its second-ranked competitor, Lowe's, gets about 30% of its business from contractors, relying more heavily on homeowners and DIY enthusiasts, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

That’s a larger drop than the 3.8% and 2.7% declines reported at stores nationwide for the same months.

Home Depot says it is not alerted to raids

Home Depot has repeatedly denied being involved in immigration enforcement operations. The company’s late co-founder Bernie Marcus supported Trump, though a Home Depot political action committee has donated to both Democrats and Republicans.

The company said it isn't told if a raid is going to take place at any of its roughly 2,300 stores.

“We tell associates to report any suspected immigration enforcement activity immediately and not engage with the activity for their safety,” said Beth Marlowe, a company spokesperson, adding that if employees feel uneasy after a raid, they can go home for the rest of the day with pay.

In Van Nuys, witnesses said federal agents have arrested those in the lot before appearing to ask about their immigration status. Local managers have shut the store's automated glass doors to keep agents out, they said.

‘Home Depot is not an innocent bystander’

The trend of workers gathering outside Home Depot began with the rise of the home improvement retail store that allowed people, including contractors, to price shop and buy materials directly, said Nik Theodore, a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois in Chicago.

“The basis of competition began to shift and what distinguishes a contractor from getting the bid or not more and more has to do with labor costs,” Theodore said. “Home Depot is not an innocent bystander in all of this. Their sources of success were instrumental in catalyzing this change.”

Bolstering the urgent call to uphold TPS is the September 5, 2025 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Edward M. Chen, who found the Administration acted unlawfully in revoking TPS protections from Venezuelans and Haitians.
The decision restores Venezuela’s January 17, 2025, TPS extension, which covered all Venezuelan TPS holders whether they first registered under the 2021 or 2023 designations.
USCRI stands in solidarity with Venezuelan communities and will continue to advocate for policies that uphold the dignity and rights of all displaced people.","The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) is alarmed by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) decision to terminate Venezuela’s 2021 Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, effective November 7, 2025. This action endangers the safety and stability of over 250,000 Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States due to widespread political persecution, economic collapse, and human rights abuses. Intervening litigation, spurred by the vacatur and termination of the 2023 designation, means that Venezuelans affected by the termination of the 2021 designation could benefit from the January 2025 extension if they re-register by September 10, 2025, if they have not already done so.

Since 2014, 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country—the largest proportion of refugees per inhabitant in the world. Without TPS, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans could be left without vital humanitarian and legal protections.

The termination of the 2021 TPS designation for Venezuela is predicated upon the Secretary’s claim that there “are notable improvements in several areas that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.” But Venezuela remains plagued by Nicolás Maduro’s regime. The government is currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

This past year, Maduro once again claimed victory in a national election marred by irregularities. Despite urgings from the Organization of American States, his government refuses to release the tally sheets or allow an impartial actor to verify the results. When thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets in peaceful protest of the results, the regime quickly cracked down, detaining and killing dissidents, with reports that at least 1,900 people were arrested. A September 2024 report from a United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, in operation since 2014, declared Venezuela’s current paradigm of human rights violations “unprecedented.”

Alongside the regime’s persecution of political dissidents, Venezuela remains mired by humanitarian crisis. It is a crisis defined by hunger: food insecurity is rampant, particularly amongst children. Nearly half of the children under the age of 5 suffer from acute or chronic malnutrition and almost 8 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Bolstering the urgent call to uphold TPS is the September 5, 2025 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Edward M. Chen, who found the Administration acted unlawfully in revoking TPS protections from Venezuelans and Haitians. The decision restores Venezuela’s January 17, 2025, TPS extension, which covered all Venezuelan TPS holders whether they first registered under the 2021 or 2023 designations. Venezuelan TPS holders who have not yet re-registered must do so before September 10, 2025, to benefit from the extension.

When he unveiled his global tariffs, Trump argued that a trade imbalance was harmful to US national security, and was therefore a national emergency.
If the Supreme Court sides with lower courts and finds that Trump's IEEPA tariffs are illegal, questions will remain over whether the US will have to pay back billions of dollars that have been gathered by import taxes on products.
Shortly after the Supreme Court announcement, Trump said on Truth Social that his administration and India were ""continuing negotiations"" on trade.
The Trump administration has other mechanisms to impose tariffs beyond IEEPA, though they are more limited in scope.","The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on whether the Trump administration's sweeping global tariffs are legal.

On Tuesday, it said it would review lower court decisions that found the president did not have the legal authority to enact the tariffs, which were brought in through an emergency economic powers act.

The justices said they would hear arguments in the case in the first week of November - an expedited timeline.

It will amount to the biggest test of Donald Trump's presidential authority and his signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions in tariffs.

The Supreme Court's conservative majority has so far been amenable to temporarily instating Trump's policies, and to his requests for emergency orders. But this case will mark the court's first assessment of the legal basis for one of his administration's most far-reaching policies.

Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose levies ranging from 10% to 50% on dozens of trading partners. He has also used the emergency law to slap tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada.

Those tariffs have remained in place as the litigation proceeds, even though a federal appeals court ruled last month that Trump exceeded his authority. The power to impose taxes and tariffs continues to belong to Congress, the court ruled.

Trump had criticised the appeals court and its ruling on Truth Social, saying: ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.""

The initial tariff challenge was brought by a group of small businesses and a dozen states, on the basis that Trump's invocation of IEEPA to impose the tariffs was unlawful.

The 1977 law states that a president can pull a number of economic levers ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy"".

While Trump is not the first to invoke it, he is the first president to attempt to leverage the statute to impose broad-based tariffs. When he unveiled his global tariffs, Trump argued that a trade imbalance was harmful to US national security, and was therefore a national emergency.

If the Supreme Court sides with lower courts and finds that Trump's IEEPA tariffs are illegal, questions will remain over whether the US will have to pay back billions of dollars that have been gathered by import taxes on products. Trade deals currently already negotiated with countries including the UK and Japan, as well as deals currently being negotiated, could also be thrown into chaos.

Shortly after the Supreme Court announcement, Trump said on Truth Social that his administration and India were ""continuing negotiations"" on trade.

""I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion,"" he said.

The Trump administration has other mechanisms to impose tariffs beyond IEEPA, though they are more limited in scope.

The president used a different law to enact his tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars. Those levies are not directly affected by this case.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9340/live/46569f30-8dbe-11f0-b575-73c6daf55268.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 20:56:49.424856

The Mexican consulate in Atlanta said 23 were being held at the ICE detention center in Folkston, Ga., and three more at the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin.

Most have signed voluntary departure documents and will be repatriated to Mexico within days.

“This Consulate General remains in communication with those workers and their families to provide the appropriate assistance,” the consulate said in a statement, adding its staff also is in touch with U.S. federal officials regarding the status of the detainees.

The Mexican workers were among hundreds of individuals detained on September 4 at the Hyundai battery plant in Ellabell. Most of those detained are South Korean nationals whose attorney told The Associated Press on Monday were doing work authorized under a B-1 business visitor visa.

The government of South Korea is working with U.S. federal officials to safely return its citizens on a charter flight.

The Mexican government, meantime, is vowing to provide protection services to its detainees.

“We have been informed that 23 Mexicans were detained in the latest raid in Georgia, in that automotive plant. Thirteen asked for help from our consulate, 10 did not,” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday.

She instructed Mexico’s consuls in the U.S. to be on the lookout for further ICE raids elsewhere in the United States, travel and assist the detainees. She said she would provide whatever additional budget consuls need to provide protection services.

Some of that assistance may include referrals to law firms or nonprofit groups authorized to provide immigration advice. Consular staff also is responsible for ensuring the detainees’ civil and human rights are respected.

“Everyone has a right to ask for that support. When there are raids, our consulates have been instructed to get in contact with U.S. authorities, ICE, which is making these unjust raids,” Sheinbaum said.

He said the increased immigration enforcement is upsetting.
“But we’re staying committed, we’re staying focused, and we’re taking everything very seriously,” Cruz said.","A few hundred people gathered downtown across from Grant Park Tuesday evening to protest Trump’s ramped-up deportation campaign in Chicago.

Demonstrators held signs reading “ICE out of Chi” and “Hands off Chicago.” Led by speakers riling up the crowd, they chanted, “Hey Chicago, what do you know, crime is at an all-time low,” a reference to the city’s falling crime rates and the lowest summer murder count since 1965 this year.

“We must organize, we must stay in the streets and keep each other safe,” one speaker said while addressing the crowd.

The protest, organized by the Coalition Against the Trump Agenda and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, drew honks from supportive drivers on Michigan Avenue.

Another speaker called out U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for monitoring local courts and detaining people showing up for their immigration case hearings.

“That ain’t right,” she said.

“I’m here today to protect your children, my children, my sisters, my brothers,” the speaker said. “We’re protecting each other by the power of community … we are looking out for each other more than ever before.”

A man was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers wearing military fatigues Tuesday morning outside his home in west suburban Cicero. The incident was covered by a Fox News team that was brought with ICE for a ride-along.

Neighbors said immigration authorities arrived around 7:30 a.m. in two unmarked vehicles and took the man as he was attempting to get into his car.

Officers broke the car’s driver-side window before pulling him out and cuffing him, neighbors said. Shards of glass were still littered across the road and grass Tuesday afternoon.

Rosa Mora and Jose Mora said they heard the news of the arrest from their neighbors who witnessed it.

“It’s terrible,” said Rosa Mora. “People are terrorized. You can’t even come out of your door just because of your color.

”The couple is new to the neighborhood, but Jose Mora said he often saw the man leave his home to drive his father-in-law to his doctor’s appointments.

“It just sucks,” said Jose Mora.

At least two Southwest Side aldermen are responding to reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in their wards today.

Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) left a City Hall budget hearing around 1 p.m. to respond to the arrest at West 26th Street and South Kostner Avenue that was caught on video.

He got a text from a constituent who recorded the arrest, but by the time he got to the scene, no one was there.

Rodriguez said he’s working with community groups to determine whether the man lives in his ward and where he’s being detained so he can connect any family members with legal or other types of support.

Ald. Byron Sigcho Lopez (25th) said he’s trying to get details about a man who was detained this morning who is married to a Chicago Public Schools teaching assistant at a school in his ward. He learned of the arrest from a mutual aid group.

Sigcho Lopez said the man is from Honduras, but he doesn’t know where he was taken after being detained near their Gage Park home this morning.

Little Village resident Jose Sanchez posted a video to Facebook on Tuesday afternoon of a man getting arrested at West 26th Street and South Kostner Avenue in the Southwest Side neighborhood.

Sanchez said he didn’t realize that the officers arresting the man were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers until he got close enough to see their badges. Sanchez didn’t know the man, but he began recording a video to alert the neighborhood that ICE was in the area.

He said the increased immigration enforcement is upsetting.

In the video, the man being arrested told officers that he had his papers in his backpack on the ground. Agents continued to handcuff him and forced him into a black van.

“They’re bullies with badges and guns,” Sanchez, 42, said. “They’re terrorizing the community.”

After recording the arrest, Sanchez said he headed to a nearby Home Depot to alert people who were waiting for work there about the presence of ICE in the neighborhood.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Sun-Times to “stay tuned” when asked whether Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is in the Chicago area to help lead the latest deportation campaign in Chicago.

Bovino, who is typically dressed in tactical gear, led the latest deportation effort in Los Angeles which has led to more than 5,000 arrests. Citing two anonymous sources, CBS News on Tuesday reported Bovino is in the Chicago area.

Bovino has posted social media videos of raids in California. He also reposted the DHS announcement on Monday about President Donald Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago.

Last week, Bovino posted a social media video featuring Border Patrol vehicles on the move: “We’re taking this show on the road to a city near you. We’re gonna trade these palm trees for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues,” Bovino said with Willie Nelson’s “On the Road Again” playing in the background.

Chicago alderpersons kept in touch with their ward offices to monitor reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sightings as they gathered Tuesday at City Hall for an unrelated budget hearing.

Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th), chair of the City Council’s Immigrant and Refugee Rights Committee, said his office had not yet seen immigration enforcement “to the level of what is being promoted by the president.” But he said he’s aware of “increased ICE activity,” referencing an incident in Archer Heights over the weekend where at least three people were detained.

Vasquez is asking residents to report immigration enforcement sightings to mutual aid groups or an alderperson’s office using the “SALUTE method” — noting the size, activity, location, uniform, time and equipment seen in any suspected enforcement action.

Northwest Side Ald. Ruth Cruz (30th) said reports of ICE sightings have started cropping up on the South Side, and she expects them to trickle north as the week stretches on.

Cruz urged residents to memorize or save the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights hotline number: 855-435-7693. She said she hadn’t noticed a major change in reported sightings or concerns from constituents since Trump’s announcement of the deportation campaign Monday.

“But we’re staying committed, we’re staying focused, and we’re taking everything very seriously,” Cruz said.

Speaking to reporters outside of the National Museum of Mexican Art in Pilsen on Tuesday, Gov. JB Pritzker said reports that Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who led enforcement raids in California, is now in Chicago is “evidence that they have terrible plans for the communities of Illinois.”

“In fact, [Trump border czar] Tom Homan has basically said that they’re going to be working double hard here, in a way that they maybe didn’t in Los Angeles,” Pritzker said. “So I’m worried for our communities. ... As far as I’m concerned, ICE needs to take it down about three notches, and we need Tom Homan to focus on something other than his failures in Illinois.”

Pritzker said he is “standing up and speaking out and ready to take them to court.”

The governor accused Trump of a “nefarious plan, frankly, to bring military into cities so that ultimately, in the 2026 election, people will be normalized to the idea of militarization during the next election so that he can affect the outcome of that election.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c02bfe2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x3261+0+512/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2Fb6%2F03ff77b64c4c9db79172703c31d0%2Fimg-4673.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 19:57:33.566168

“The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement. These smears are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing 1,000% increase in assaults against them,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at, or ‘raiding,’ schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children. Criminals are no longer be able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.”

The facts are DHS’s directive allowing ICE to go into schools gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs. Our agents use discretion. Officers would need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a school. We expect these to be extremely rare.

President Trump and Secretary Noem empowered the brave men and women of ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal illegal aliens—including murders, rapists, and pedophiles—who have illegally come into our country.

case logged onto Zoom for the 12:30 p.m. hearing before Judge Sooknanan.","Around 3:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, a supervisor at the Compass Connections children’s shelter in Harlingen, Texas, woke a 17-year-old boy from his sleep. Without explaining why or where they were going, the supervisor told the boy to gather his things to leave. Soon, under cover of darkness, the boy was ushered alongside other children onto a bus headed for the airport.

The boy, identified only as “A.R.M.D.” in court filings, began to pray. Growing up in Guatemala, he had experienced what he described as “neglect and abandonment” at the hands of his father. His single mother was unable to shield him from the “violent conditions” and “drug dealers” who threatened his safety, he said in a recent court declaration.

That’s why, last year, A.R.M.D. fled his home country for the United States. Upon arrival, he was placed in the Harlingen shelter by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for the care and custody of unaccompanied minors. His immigration proceedings are ongoing, with a court hearing scheduled for early October.

But on the morning of Aug. 31, as the bus made its way to the airport, A.R.M.D. worried that he would be returned to Guatemala without the opportunity to make his case in court.

Sharing his anxiety were other Guatemalan children who, like A.R.M.D., had been roused from bed in the middle of the night at their respective foster homes or care facilities. At a children’s shelter in McAllen, Texas, one young girl “was so scared that she vomited and asked to speak with a clinician.” Another teenager, who said that her sister was murdered in Guatemala last year, worried that she, too, would be killed if she returned. Other potential deportees cited personal histories involving family violence, sexual abuse, or human trafficking as reasons why they were afraid to return to their home country.

In theory, the law is supposed to protect unaccompanied children from being summarily whisked out of the country by the government. Recognizing their uniquely vulnerable status, courts and Congress have, over the course of several decades, carved out special legal protections for unaccompanied children. Among the most notable is the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, signed into law by President George W. Bush, which establishes that any unaccompanied child not from Mexico or Canada must be placed in immigration court proceedings and provided access to counsel. These protections essentially exempt many unaccompanied children from speedy deportation—called “expedited removal”—and ensure that they have their day in court.

But none of that seemed to matter on Labor Day weekend. The Trump administration, in its frantic effort to deport immigrants en masse, gathered dozens of children and put them on airplanes for deportation. A.R.M.D. is one of ten named plaintiffs in a suit that unfolded over the holiday weekend as immigration attorneys sought to halt their summary expulsion.

The circumstances bear a striking similarity to that of an earlier case involving the frenzied removal of migrants without process and with scant legal basis. In that case, which played out in March before Judge James Boasberg, the planes took off from the United States and landed in El Salvador—and more than 250 men ended up in a notorious prison.

This time, too, the administration’s efforts to remove these children in secret and over a weekend prompted the speedy intervention of a district court judge. But Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who handled the case this time, had a big advantage over Judge Boasberg: She knew what had happened the last time.

And that, it turned out, made all the difference. At key moments, Sooknanan—her eye clearly on what happened before Judge Boasberg—made different decisions, put things in writing, and monitored compliance with her orders to make sure the children were not removed behind her back, or over her objections. The result is that a week later, the children are still in the United States—and there is an ongoing legal process before a different judge to decide their fate.

Weekend Emergency Removal Litigation: Vol. 1

Nearly six months ago, on March 15, it was Judge Boasberg who took the unusual step of holding a hearing on a Saturday evening.

The hearing had been set in motion one day prior, when President Donald J. Trump supposedly signed—but had not yet published—a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The rarely-used law, which dates to 1798, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of hostile governments. In this case, the proclamation claims to invoke the Act against an “invasion” by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela criminal gang. According to the proclamation, that finding authorizes the Trump administration to summarily remove migrants it deems to be members of Tren de Aragua.

The proclamation would remain a secret until it was published the next day. In the meantime, however, the United States government was preparing to spirit away hundreds of Venezuelan men—not to Venezuela, but to El Salvador, which had agreed to imprison the men in the brutal prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

As the government began to move migrants in preparation for their deportation flights, advocates caught wind of the plan. Around 1:00 a.m. on Saturday, March 15, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of five Venezuelan men who were being held at an immigration facility near Harlingen, Texas. Each of the plaintiffs in the case, called J.G.G. v. Trump, had open immigration cases—and each adamantly denied being a member of Tren de Aragua. Shortly after filing suit, the ACLU lawyers sought a temporary restraining order to bar the removal of the five men under the Act.

Around 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, the case landed with Judge Boasberg, a former prosecutor who was first appointed by George W. Bush to D.C. Superior Court and, later, by Barack Obama to the federal district court. Upon learning that he’d been randomly assigned to the case, the judge promptly “reached out to locate government counsel,” according to an opinion he issued in April. In the meantime, the plaintiffs’ lawyers informed Boasberg that at least one of the named plaintiffs in the suit had already been boarded on a plane that could depart imminently. The judge, having not yet heard back from the government, issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the government from removing the five men named in the suit.

The named plaintiffs were subsequently removed from the planes, but that left an outstanding question: What would happen to the other migrants waiting on the tarmac? Earlier that morning, lawyers for the ACLU had filed a motion to provisionally certify a broader class of people who were subject to removal under the Act. Over the government’s objections, Boasberg set a 5:00 p.m. emergency hearing to hear argument on whether he should extend the protection of his temporary restraining order to the broader group.

The hearing began that evening, about an hour after Trump’s proclamation became public at 3:53 p.m. Drew Ensign, a former corporate lawyer turned Justice Department political appointee, appeared on behalf of the government. As he cited case after case in support of the government’s opposition to class certification, it was obvious that Ensign had come prepared with detailed legal arguments. Still, he insisted that he did not know any details about whether deportations were underway. At one point, Boasberg asked if any flights were scheduled to leave “in the next twenty-four or forty-eight hours.” Ensign replied: “I don’t know the answer to that question.”

A whistleblower report would later claim that this statement by Ensign was false. According to the whistleblower—a former Justice Department official named Erez Reuveni—Ensign had been present for a meeting the day before the March 15 hearing. According to Reuveni’s account of that meeting, Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove had told Ensign and others that planes containing migrants subject to the proclamation would take off over the weekend “no matter what.”

Unaware of that key detail, Boasberg took Ensign at his word. By that point, the plaintiffs had informed the judge that planes may have already taken off during the hearing. Even so, rather than extending the protections of his previous order, the judge temporarily adjourned the hearing so that Ensign could “do some digging” into the status of the flights. During the forty-minute break, two planes carrying migrants took off for Honduras en route to their final destination: El Salvaldor.

Ensign, for his part, claimed to be ignorant of the departures. When he returned to the hearing at 6:00 p.m., he said he still did not know the status of the flights. “I do not have additional details I can provide at this time,” he told the judge.

At about 6:45 p.m., Boasberg issued an oral order barring the government from removing any noncitizen solely on the basis of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation. He instructed Ensign that “any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.” This is something that needs to be complied with “immediately,” Boasberg added.

The judge’s order was memorialized in writing on the court’s docket at 7:25 p.m. Minutes later—at 7:37 p.m. and 8:10 p.m., respectively—the two flights that had taken off during the hearing landed in Honduras, where they remained for several hours before departing for El Salvador. There, hours after Boasberg’s written order appeared on the docket, members of the putative class covered by that order were transferred into the custody of El Salvador.

On Sunday morning, March 16, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, began posting videos of the shackled migrants as they were hauled off planes and marched into prison cells at CECOT. In another post on X, Bukele linked to a New York Post headline about Boasberg’s order. “Oopsie…Too late,” he wrote. The Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, reposted Bukele’s tweet.

In the days and weeks that followed, the government stonewalled as the judge tried to get answers about the factual circumstances surrounding the government’s apparent non-compliance. In a series of increasingly antagonistic filings, the government essentially argued that it was not obligated to comply with Boasberg’s oral command to turn the planes around. Instead, the Justice Department claimed that it was only obligated to follow the written order, which it interpreted as prohibiting “removal” of the migrants from United States territory—as opposed to removal from United States custody. Because the planes had exited U.S. airspace before Boasberg had entered that written order, the government reasoned that it had not violated the order when it transferred the migrants to Salvadoran custody.

In April, as Boasberg weighed whether to initiate contempt proceedings related to the government’s non-compliance, the Supreme Court vacated the temporary restraining orders he had issued the month prior. By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court held that the plaintiffs in the case filed the wrong type of suit in the wrong venue. Announcing that challenges to removal under the Alien Enemies Act sound in habeas corpus, the court essentially found that the plaintiffs should have filed a habeas petition in Texas instead of the suit they brought in Washington, D.C.

The ruling raised the question of whether Boasberg would continue to pursue an inquiry into the government’s non-compliance with his orders—orders that, according to the Supreme Court, he did not have jurisdiction to issue in the first place. Little more than two weeks later, the judge gave his answer. In a scorching 46-page opinion, Boasberg found probable cause to hold the government in criminal contempt. The government could remedy the contempt, Boasberg said, by giving the men detained under the Alien Enemies Act an opportunity to challenge their detentions. If not, he would initiate proceedings to figure out who was responsible for the contempt. And, if the Justice Department ultimately declined to charge that person with a crime, Boasberg said that he’d appoint a prosecutor to do the job under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Within days of issuing that order, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily paused the contempt proceedings while it considered whether to block the order entirely. Then, in early August, the appeals court delivered another blow to Boasberg’s efforts to hold the government accountable. By a 2-to-1 vote, the panel vacated Boasberg’s probable cause order. The majority judges, both of whom were appointed to the bench by President Trump, diverged in their reasoning. Judge Gregory Katsas found that Boasberg’s order could not support a criminal contempt conviction because his prohibition on “removing” alleged Tren de Aragua members was, at best, ambiguous. Judge Neomi Rao, on the other hand, reasoned that Boasberg inappropriately sought to compel compliance with his order by “pressuring” the government to assert custody over the Venezuelan men to remedy its violation.

Despite their diverging views, neither Judge Katsas nor Judge Rao spared much sympathy for their colleague on the district court—who had, by all appearances, been treated in a manner no self-respecting federal judge would tolerate, even if one accepted that it didn’t rise to criminal contempt. Rao wrote that Boasberg’s probable cause order “forces a coequal branch to choose between capitulating to an unlawful judicial order and subjecting its officials to a dubious prosecution.” Katsas similarly warned that the show-cause order “would provoke many grave conflicts between the Judicial Branch and the Executive Branch.” Neither judge acknowledged that this interbranch crisis had been precipitated not by Boasberg’s order, but by an executive branch bent on testing the limits of judicial authority.

The panel’s decision came just three weeks after 252 men whom the Trump administration had sent to El Salvador were set free. On July 18, the men were released to Venezuela as a part of a prisoner exchange orchestrated by the United States government. After their release, according to news reports and court filings, the men revealed that their time in CECOT had been marked by physical violence, inadequate nutrition, medical neglect, and, in some cases, sexual assault. The Washington Post reported that, at one point, the detainees tried to stage a hunger strike. When that failed, they used shards from metal pipes to cut into their skin so that they could write messages on their sheets in blood. One read: “We are not terrorists, we are migrants.”

Some of those men were on the planes that would never have reached El Salvador had the government complied with Judge Boasberg’s order. And though their eventual release marked the end of a horrific ordeal, it brought the public no closer to learning the truth of who should be held accountable for the government’s non-compliance—and how.

One thing the J.G.G. case did apparently do, however, was offer the other judges on the district bench in Washington an object lesson in how to handle—and how not to handle—government representations when it is organizing a secret mass deportation over a weekend that suddenly spills out into court. And it turns out, the judges were listening.

Weekend Emergency Removal Litigation: Vol. 2

Six months later, as A.R.M.D. and dozens of other children prepared to board buses bound for an airport in Texas, a different federal judge awoke to news of a lawsuit in Washington, D.C.

The judge, Sparkle Sooknanan, was a recent addition to the federal bench, having been appointed to the district court by Joe Biden in January of this year. Earlier in her career, Sooknanan worked as a corporate lawyer and, later, served as a Justice Department official during the Biden administration.

Over Labor Day weekend, Sooknanan was serving as the court’s emergency duty judge—that is, the district court judge on call to handle any emergency litigation that might arise outside of normal business hours. Around 2:00 a.m. that Sunday, Aug. 31, she was alerted to the emergency unfolding in a case called L.G.M.L et al. v. Noem.

​​In the days and weeks leading up to the emergency litigation, advocates for unaccompanied children had observed several unusual developments related to their clients’ immigration proceedings. In August, officers with Homeland Security Investigations—a criminal law enforcement division—began conducting interviews with children in the custody of ORR, supposedly for the purpose of facilitating “family reunification.” Later that month, during immigration hearings, some unaccompanied children were informed by immigration judges that their names appeared on a list of minors seeking voluntary return to Guatemala—despite never having made such a request.

By the end of August, immigration attorneys observed that several of their clients’ previously scheduled immigration hearings had been cancelled without explanation.

Late in the evening on Aug. 30, it became clear why. At 11:45 p.m. Eastern Time, ORR sent notices to care providers, informing them that children in their program had been identified for “reunification” to Guatemala and instructing them to prepare the children for discharge within two hours.

In an effort to stop the deportations, lawyers with the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) filed suit on behalf of ten unaccompanied Guatemalan children around 1:00 a.m. on Aug. 31. The complaint alleges that the government’s planned removals violate specific statutory and constitutional protections to which unaccompanied children are entitled, including those established in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA).

Shortly after filing the complaint, the NILC lawyers sought a temporary restraining order to halt the deportations of the 10 plaintiffs named in the suit. An unusual addition to the motion’s caption underscored the sense of urgency: “FLIGHTS DEPARTING THE UNITED STATES IN THE NEXT FOUR HOURS.”

As Judge Boasberg did back in March, Judge Sooknanan sprang into action. She promptly reached out to counsel for the government, seeking to ascertain more information. At 3:18 a.m. Eastern Time, she left a voicemail on the phone of Brian Hudak, the chief of the Civil Division at the Justice Department. The judge also left a message with Jonathan Hornock, the head of the Criminal Division, telling him that the case had been filed and that she wanted to hear from the government, if possible.

As Sooknanan waited for word from the government, lawyers for the Guatemalan children notified her that they, too, had been unable to reach anyone at the Justice Department. They added that shelters in South Texas had been notified by the ORR to prepare Guatemalan children for discharge. “Upon information and belief, ICE agents and their contractors have started attempting to pick up Guatemalan unaccompanied children from shelters in South Texas to transport them to the airport for potential removal from the United States,” the attorneys wrote.

At 4:22 a.m., having yet to receive a response from the government, the judge entered a temporary restraining order barring the removal of the children named in the suit “to maintain the status quo until a hearing can be set.”

Like Boasberg in J.G.G., Judge Sooknanan initially stopped short of extending the protection of her order to a broader group beyond the ten named plaintiffs. But the potential class was large—the L.G.M.L. attorneys estimated that more than 100 children were already boarding flights for removal, and hundreds more were potentially at risk of being summarily deported. Sooknanan set a 3:00 p.m. hearing to hear arguments on both the temporary restraining order and the class certification questions.

Later that morning, however, the judge received another call on the court’s emergency line. It was the plaintiffs’ attorneys, who reported that some of the children in the proposed class were already being transferred to planes for removal.

And this is where, with her eye likely on how the government had abused Judge Boasberg’s imprecisions, Judge Sooknanan started handling things differently. In light of that information, she moved the 3:00 p.m. hearing up to 12:30 p.m.

More than 1,400 miles southwest of the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse, A.R.M.D. arrived by bus to the Sun Valley Airport. By then, the judge’s 4:22 a.m. order barring his removal had been in place for hours. But the teenager’s statement suggests he didn’t know that as he stepped off the bus around 11 a.m. Eastern Time and exchanged goodbyes with the friends he’d made at the shelter. Standing in view of the tarmac, he watched as other children boarded the planes, wondering if he’d be called next.

Meanwhile, one of his attorneys, Lauren Flores, had also made her way to the airport. Flores is the legal director at ProBAR, a pro bono immigration services provider whose clients include unaccompanied children at 22 shelters across South Texas. Around 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time the night before, while many of ProBAR’s attorneys were asleep, the organization learned that shelter programs had been told to prepare children to be repatriated. The next morning, Flores awoke to a “flurry” of urgent messages informing her that some of ProBAR’s clients had been removed from ORR custody—and were already being boarded onto an ICE-contracted transport plane.

Armed with Judge Sooknanan’s restraining order, Flores arrived at the airport to search for A.R.M.D. and others. On the tarmac, she saw two ICE transport planes, their doors sealed shut. Nearby, she spotted a building and knocked on the door. Through the glass, she could see officers seated inside. Eventually, a young man answered the door. Flores explained that she had clients on one of the planes and a court order to stop it from leaving.

While the young man disappeared inside the building to find his supervisor, Flores waited next to the door. She told anyone who entered or exited the building that they “were all complicit in violating a federal court order” if the plane left with her clients aboard.

Eventually, when the young man returned, he told Flores that his supervisor was trying to contact ICE. But as Flores again tried to explain that she had a court order, another official stepped outside and “physically pulled the young man back into the building.” Through the glass, she saw staff members “jeering and laughing.” She repeated her earlier warning: If the plane carrying her clients took off, they were “all complicit in the violation of the judge’s order.”

What Flores didn’t know was that A.R.M.D. had never been boarded onto a plane. According to a declaration filed in L.G.M.L., he was ultimately told that he wasn’t “on the list” of minors being returned. For hours, as he waited to return to the shelter, he watched the planes on the tarmac and worried that they’d made a mistake. Around 12:00 or 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time—either just before or during Judge Sooknanan’s hearing in D.C.—he says he saw one of the planes take off. Not long after that, the same plane returned, with the children still aboard.

As this scene played out in Texas, counsel on both sides in the L.G.M.L. case logged onto Zoom for the 12:30 p.m. hearing before Judge Sooknanan. Efren Olivares, an experienced immigration attorney with the NILC, appeared on behalf of the Guatemalan children. Representing the Justice Department was none other than Ensign—the same attorney who’d been accused of misleading Boasberg in J.G.G.

Judge Sooknanan was running late, and the reason for her tardiness soon became apparent: At 12:37 p.m., the judge issued a new written order. The order prohibited the government from removing any “Guatemalan unaccompanied minors” who were in ORR custody as of 1:02 a.m. on Aug. 31, 2025. The judge, in other words, had agreed to extend her restraining order to a broader group of plaintiffs.

The hearing began minutes after Judge Sooknanan issued the new order. Skipping the usual pleasantries, she cut to the chase: “Mr. Ensign, can I ask you, are you aware that I just issued an order on the docket with respect to the putative class?”

“I’m not,” Ensign replied.

Noting that she had already emailed the new order to the chief of the Civil Division at the Justice Department, Judge Sooknanan told Ensign that she wanted to adjourn the hearing so that he could circulate the order himself. “I want to make sure that you take five minutes right now and circulate that order to everyone who needs to see it,” she said.

When Ensign returned from recess, he informed the judge that all of the planes had been grounded. One of them might have taken off, he said, but his understanding was that the plane had returned. (The government, in a recent filing, now denies that any planes ever took off.)

This appears to reflect another lesson Sooknanan may have learned from Boasberg’s experience: She made sure the planes were still on the ground in the United States. There would be no question of whether the children were beyond the reach of her orders because they had left U.S. airspace already. There would be no question of whether the client agency understood that orders had been issued or what their contours were.

Turning to the legal arguments, Ensign detailed, for the first time, the government’s purported legal basis for summarily removing the children. He contended that the administration’s authority to do so derives from a subsection of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which assigns ORR responsibility for the care and custody of unaccompanied minors. Among other duties, the Act provides that ORR is responsible for “reuniting unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.” According to Ensign, this “reunification” provision allows ORR to repatriate unaccompanied children without regard to the statutory protections set out in the TVPRA, which entitles such children to full immigration court proceedings and access to counsel.

“The Government of Guatemala has requested the return of these children, and all of these children have their parents or guardians in Guatemala who are requesting their return,” Ensign told the judge. “We certainly dispute that these are removals,” he continued, referring to the statutory language used in immigration statutes, including the TVPRA. “This is reuniting children with their parents and guardians.”

Judge Sooknanan, for her part, was “alarmed” at Ensign’s argument—and for good reason. In the normal course of immigration proceedings, if a child wants to be reunited with a parent abroad, the child’s attorney can request voluntary departure from an immigration court. Once the petition is granted, ORR plays a limited role in facilitating the child’s safe repatriation. But under the government’s broad interpretation of the law, a little-known subsection of the Homeland Security Act would authorize ORR to establish its own repatriation program, bypassing the normal immigration process and sidestepping laws that Congress specifically enacted to protect a particularly vulnerable population.

Judge Sooknanan was also skeptical of the factual basis for Ensign’s claims. He had asserted that every child’s parent had requested their return to Guatemala. But counsel for the plaintiffs disputed that, pointing to declarations they had filed on behalf of the children. With Ensign’s alleged misrepresentations so recently the subject of public controversy, the judge took care to establish a clear factual record on this point.

“Mr. Ensign, are you representing that all of these children are being moved because their parents have requested that they return to Guatemala?” she asked.

“Your honor, that’s my understanding,” he replied. “That’s what I’ve been told, that these requests have been relayed through the government of Guatemala.” He added that any disputed questions of fact to that end could be “resolved through briefing.”

At this point, Judge Sooknanan had heard enough. She announced that she planned to keep her temporary restraining orders in place at least until the parties briefed the matter.

Sooknanan then directed her attention to Olivares, the plaintiffs’ attorney. “Mr. Olivares, do you believe you have what you need in terms of an order from this court to prevent these children from being removed until we sort out which narrative here is correct?” she asked. “I do not want there to be any ambiguity about what I am ordering or what the government is to do down the road.”

“There have been multiple instances where, you know, ex post allegations of confusion and misunderstanding have resulted in irreparable harm,” Olivares replied. “Frankly, part of me would like to stay in this hearing until the kids have deplaned, if that were possible.”

Taking this cue, Judge Sooknanan instructed Ensign to go find out if his clients planned to deplane the children and return them to ORR custody. Ensign scurried off to call his clients and, upon his return, he confirmed that the government did, indeed, intend to deplane and return the children pursuant to the court’s order.

Sooknanan, for her part, told Ensign that she’d had a chance to read from some of the plaintiffs’ declarations while he was gone. “I just want to read from some of the declarations, because I have these conflicting stories about whether this is an attempt to reunite children with their parents,” she said.

For the next several minutes, the judge read aloud from passages in various declarations submitted with the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. In one, a minor describes how her parents in Guatemala unexpectedly received a “strange phone call” in which someone told them that the United States government planned to deport their child as a part of a larger group of Guatemalans. In others, the children say that they came to the United States after experiencing abuse, neglect, and family violence.

“Every one of these ten declarants who are named plaintiffs speak about being afraid of going back to Guatemala,” the judge observed. “This doesn’t quite line up with what I’m hearing from the government…This is why we have process, this is why we have courts.”

Judge Sooknanan then acknowledged that it is “extraordinary” to enter a temporary restraining order, especially without first hearing from both sides of the case. But, she continued, the government chose the “wee hours of the morning on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend” to execute a plan to move the children. “Absent action and intervention by the court, all of those children would have been returned to Guatemala, potentially to extremely dangerous situations,” she said.

“I’m going to put it on the record again, just so there’s absolutely no ambiguity about where we are,” the judge continued before concluding the hearing. “These children are going to be deplaned. They're going to be returned to ORR custody. And no attempts will be made to remove them from ORR custody and remove them to Guatemala, in light of my order, while these preliminary emergency proceedings are pending,” she said.

Her expectations were absolutely clear. There was no exploitable gap between what she said orally and what she said in writing.

And over the remainder of Labor Day weekend, Sooknanan closely monitored the government’s efforts to return the children to their respective care facilities. In total, she ordered the government to submit five status reports detailing its progress. By noon on Monday, the government reported that all 76 of the children at the airport had been returned to ORR custody.

Among them was A.R.M.D., whose bus departed the airport around 7:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Aug. 31, more than 16 hours after he’d been pulled out of bed at the Harlingen shelter the night before. But instead of returning to his previous shelter, he was dropped off at a new facility some 30 minutes down the road. “Since this happened, I feel like the days are really long,” A.R.M.D. wrote in a recent court filing. “I can’t focus on anything because I just keep thinking about them trying to return me to Guatemala.”

Judge Sooknanan’s temporary restraining order remains in place while the parties litigate the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and class certification, which, if granted, would provide longer-term relief to the proposed class. But the resolution of that motion won’t be decided by Judge Sooknanan, whose involvement with the case ended with her tenure as the emergency duty judge after the holiday weekend.

By a vote of 7-4, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals from the Court of International Trade, upheld that ruling in a lengthy opinion on Aug. 29.","Setting the stage for a major ruling on presidential power, the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to decide whether a 1977 federal law giving the president certain emergency powers allowed President Donald Trump to levy tariffs on nearly all goods imported into the United States through a series of executive orders.

In a brief order issued by the court’s Public Information Office on Tuesday afternoon, the court announced that it had granted review in two cases: Learning Resources v. Trump, in which two small businesses had asked the justices to weigh in on Trump’s power to impose the tariffs without waiting for a federal appeals court to rule on the Trump administration’s appeal; and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, in which the Trump administration had asked the court to review a ruling by a different federal appeals court striking down the tariffs. The court will fast-track the two cases, which will be argued together, and hold oral arguments in early November.

In a series of executive orders, Trump imposed tariffs that fall into two categories, which collectively cover a wide range of products from U.S. trading partners. The first category, known as the “trafficking tariffs,” apply to goods from Canada, China, and Mexico, which in Trump’s view have not done enough to halt the flow of fentanyl into the United States. The second category, known as the “reciprocal tariffs,” impose a minimum tariff of 10% (which can escalate up to 50%) on products from virtually all countries.

The law at the center of the case is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that allows the president to take action to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States” if he declares a national emergency “with respect to such threat.” When he imposed the tariffs, Trump relied on IEEPA, and in particular on a provision of the law that authorizes the president, in times of national emergencies, to “regulate . . . importation” of “property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.”

Two small family-owned businesses, Learning Resources and hand2mind, challenged the tariffs in federal court in Washington, D.C. They contend that paying the tariffs in 2025 will cost them $100 million – nearly 45 times as much as they paid in 2024.

In a decision on May 29, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that the IEEPA tariffs were illegal and barred the Trump administration from enforcing the tariffs against the two businesses.

In an unusual move, the challengers came to the Supreme Court in June, asking the justices to take up the case without waiting for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to decide the Trump administration’s appeal. They urged the justices to act quickly, telling them that “paralyzing uncertainty” is created when tariffs are “added and subtracted at will.”

The Trump administration urged the court to stay out of the dispute. It countered that the Learning Resources case did “not warrant the extraordinary step of granting” review before the D.C. Circuit had weighed in on the government’s appeal, particularly when the D.C. Circuit had “expedited its consideration of the appeal.” Moreover, it added, Contreras did not have the power to take up the challengers’ case.

The justices denied the request by Learning Resources and hand2mind to fast-track the consideration of their petition for review.

Meanwhile, in a pair of separate challenges to the tariffs, filed by another group of small businesses and a group of states, led by Oregon, the Court of International Trade on May 28 ruled that both categories of tariffs – the trafficking tariffs and the reciprocal tariffs – exceeded Trump’s power under IEEPA.

By a vote of 7-4, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals from the Court of International Trade, upheld that ruling in a lengthy opinion on Aug. 29. It explained that, among other things, when “Congress intends to delegate to the President the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an overall structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs.”

In a petition for review filed on Sept. 3, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer – the Trump administration’s top lawyer before the Supreme Court – told the justices that the “tariffs and the ensuing trade negotiations with all our major trading partners are pulling America back from the precipice of disaster, restoring its respect and standing in the world, eliminating decades of unfair and asymmetric trade policies that have gutted our manufacturing capacity and military readiness, and inducing our trade partners to invest trillions of dollars in the American economy.”

The small businesses agreed that the Supreme Court should review the Federal Circuit’s ruling, but they continued to insist that “the tariffs are unlawful for multiple reasons, the government’s arguments to the contrary are flawed, and invalidating these tariffs will not deprive the President of the ability to impose other tariffs and negotiate lawful trade agreements under the numerous statutes that Congress has enacted for that purpose.”

Oregon and the other states echoed that sentiment in their brief, telling the justices that “although the Federal Circuit got it right—and although the petition is littered with inaccuracies, hyperbole, and citations to material outside the summary judgment record—the state respondents agree that this Court should grant expedited review.”

On Tuesday afternoon, the Supreme Court did just that. It instructed the Trump administration to file its opening brief on Sept. 19, with the challengers’ briefs to follow on Oct. 20. “The cases will be set for argument in the first week of the November 2025 argument session,” which begins on Nov. 3.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2205529616.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 20:56:52.782255

The small businesses and states that challenged them also agreed to the accelerated timetable. They say Trump’s import taxes on goods from nearly every country in the world have nearly driven their businesses to bankruptcy.

Two lower courts have agreed that Trump didn’t have the power to impose tariffs on nearly every country on earth under an emergency powers law, though a 7-4 appeals court has left them in place for now.

The Trump administration asked the justices to intervene quickly, arguing the law gives him the power to regulate imports and striking down the tariffs would put the country on “the brink of economic catastrophe.”

The case will come before a court that has been reluctant to check Trump’s extraordinary flex of executive power. One big question is whether the justices’ own expansive view of presidential authority allows for Trump’s tariffs without the explicit approval of Congress, which the Constitution endows with the power to levy tariffs. Three of the justices on the conservative-majority court were nominated by Trump in his first term.

While the tariffs and their erratic rollout have raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth, Trump has also used them to pressure other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point a year earlier.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer has argued that the lower court rulings are already affecting those trade negotiations. If the tariffs are struck down, the U.S. Treasury might take a hit by having to refund some of the import taxes it’s collected, Trump administration officials have said. A ruling against them could even the nation’s ability to reduce the flow of fentanyl and efforts to end Russia’s war against Ukraine, Sauer argued.

The administration did win over four appeals court judges who found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, lets the president regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations. In recent decades, Congress has ceded some tariff authority to the president and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

The case involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.

It doesn’t include his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, or the tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The case has bounced around the court system.","Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Tuesday temporarily paused a federal judge’s ruling ordering the Trump administration to pay out $4 billion in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress.

The chief justice, acting on his own, issued an interim “administrative stay” of the ruling and ordered the challengers to file their brief by Friday. The full court is likely to rule on whether to issue a longer pause soon after that, probably next week, in a convoluted case that centers on presidential authority and Congress’s power of the purse.

Chief Justice Roberts’s order noted that the money is the subject of a proposal from the administration pending before Congress. That proposal, known as a “pocket rescission,” is a legally untested effort to claw back appropriated money by waiting so late in the fiscal year to make the request that lawmakers do not have time to reject it before the funding expires. It could make the court challenge moot.

The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, before the 45-day period in which Congress is required to consider a rescission request from the White House. Republicans could bring the matter to a vote sooner, but party leaders have shown little appetite for resisting the president’s spending demands and asserting their own prerogatives.

The case before the Supreme Court has reached the justices three times. In an emergency application filed Monday, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, told the court that the judge’s order requiring it to spend $4 billion in payments by the end of the month raised “a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.”

Mr. Sauer noted the proposal before Congress. “While proposed rescissions are pending, presidents do not spend the funds, for obvious reasons: it would be self-defeating and senseless for the executive branch to obligate the very funds that it is asking Congress to rescind,” he wrote. “Yet the new injunction would force the executive branch to start obligating those funds at breakneck speed to meet the Sept. 30 deadline, even as Congress is considering the rescission proposal and before its 45 days to do so elapse.”

The application was the latest in a barrage of emergency requests by the administration seeking broad executive authority, including the power to halt federal spending appropriated by Congress for programs at odds with President Trump’s agenda.

The Supreme Court, with six conservative justices, has proved receptive to most of the administration’s claims, handing the president a series of technically temporary victories that have nevertheless had broad practical consequences. In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Still, in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case, in March, the chief justice and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, two nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s authority over spending.

The case has bounced around the court system. The latest application concerns a ruling last week from Judge Amir Ali of the Federal District Court in Washington that said the administration had “given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress’s appropriations must be followed” and requiring the administration to allow the funds to flow.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/09trump-news-scotus-foreign-aid/04dc-bar1-fgzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 18:56:42.839732

The guide, published by ACLU, Equality Maine and national legal advocacy group GLAD law, includes advice for families and schools on keeping students safe. It explains what rights groups of marginalized students — including immigrant, LGBTQ+ and unhoused students — have on campus, what they can do to request support from schools and under what circumstances educational institutions have to comply with law enforcement.

“Throughout the country and right here in Maine, politicians, school boards, and others have made clear their commitment to banning books, censoring classroom discussions, and curtailing other constitutional rights,” said ACLU of Maine Legal Director Carol Garvan in a statement.

“These efforts undermine a central purpose of our education system: to expose students to a diversity of ideas and prepare them to live in our multicultural democracy.”

Rights of LGBTQ+ students

Despite several attempts at the state level this year, Maine’s protections for transgender students remain intact as enshrined in the Maine Human Rights Act.

“Despite the overreach by the federal government recently, the Maine Human Rights Act is still the law in Maine, which aims to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination in schools. Every student has the right to a safe learning environment,” said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine.

That means students are guaranteed legal protections that go beyond general anti-discrimination policies. State law also requires public schools to ensure students are not discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and obligates districts to adopt policies that actively prevent bullying and harassment.

The Maine Department of Education also has issued guidance on model policies for LGBTQ+ students, reminding districts that they are required to follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which continues to protect trans students’ rights to access affirming facilities at school.

The document explains that this means Maine students have the right to use restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity, to be addressed by their chosen name and pronouns, and to participate in school activities — including sports — in line with their gender identity. They also have the right to express themselves through clothing and other personal choices without fear of punishment or harassment.

Advocates stress that these rights are backed not only by Maine’s Human Rights Act but also by federal law, including Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.

Immigrant students’ rights

Despite the uptick in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, the guide emphasizes that federal law requires that all students — regardless of immigration status — have access to free public education. Schools cannot deny enrollment based on citizenship or demand proof of immigration status.

Under Maine’s Human Rights Act, protections in school also extend to bullying and harassment tied to one’s national origin or family background. Schools are also required to provide instruction and support for English language learners, and aren’t allowed to exclude them from classes.

Federal privacy laws also forbid school staff from sharing student education records with outside agencies without parental consent or a court order. That means immigration officials, including ICE, cannot simply request records or student information from schools.

Some school districts with large immigrant populations, such as Lewiston or Brunswick, issued letters and guidance to families in January, establishing protocols for staff members if ICE agents show up on campuses.

To protect students, the ACLU says all schools should adopt policies that require legal review before responding to subpoenas or information requests. Neither the Maine Department of Education nor the Maine School Superintendents Association track district-level policies, but Maine superintendents “are committed to creating schools that are safe, welcoming, and centered on every student’s success,” association President Eileen King in a statement.

Families can opt out of allowing directory information — such as a student’s name or address — to be shared, closing off another potential avenue for outside access.

In the event that a parent is detained, the guide instructs schools to rely on emergency contact forms provided by the family, not immigration authorities, when determining who can pick up a child. The guide encourages families to update those contacts regularly to ensure continuity of care.

By spelling out these protections, the ACLU underscores that schools are not enforcement arms of federal immigration agencies and have a responsibility to safeguard students’ privacy and access to education.

Book bans and access to education

The document also addresses the increase in efforts nationwide to challenge access to books, although this has not been a widespread issue in Maine schools.

The document still warns against a national wave of efforts to restrict access to materials that deal with race, gender identity and sexuality, as most banned or challenged books are about marginalized communities.

According to the guide, students have a constitutional right to receive information and ideas, a protection the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized for decades. That means public schools and libraries cannot remove books simply because they contain unpopular viewpoints or because some parents object to their content.

While schools do have discretion in developing curricula, and Maine stresses local control, meaning the state allows districts to choose what to teach and what books to use, the guide notes that removing library books for political or ideological reasons violates the First Amendment. All students, the guide notes, are entitled to a library that reflects a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

The document also encourages students who encounter book removals to document what happened, raise concerns with administrators, and, if necessary, seek legal support.

“Access to information is a cornerstone of education,” the guide states. “When schools start pulling books, it’s not just about one title—it’s about silencing ideas.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pride-parade-9_1500.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 21:57:15.596148

‘They were definitely ICE agents. They were all wearing green vests and masks,” the witness, who asked that his name not be published, said. “They (the agents) wheeled up, got out of three or four unmarked cars and asked the people on the roof to come down. However, they refused so at least two agents went up on the roof, using a ladder to a lower roof and then a second ladder to the main roof,” the witness, a retiree, said.

All the roofers were brought down the ladders very carefully, the witness said. “Once they were on the ground, they were handcuffed immediately,” he said. The witness said at least two of the agents at the front had their guns drawn. During the 10 a.m. raid, which took under an hour to complete, “the bank was locked,” the witness said. “Some agents were on the roof, two were out front and others were out back. The bank was surrounded,” he said.

The witness said he saw one marked state police cruiser on the scene. State police had no comment about the incident. Borough police said they were not involved and were not aware of the raid.

All but one of the suspected illegal immigrants were placed in the back of a van and whisked away fairly quickly, the witness said. One remaining suspect was put in the back of one of the unmarked cars. The witness said all the agents “acted in a very professional manner.”

The raid caught the attention of spectators, many of whom were quick to record the event on their cellphones, the witness said.

“Some of them bad-mouthed the agents. “I heard one person yell ‘Fake cops’ while another said ‘All they want to do is work,'” the witness said.

The Sun-Gazette reached out to ICE, which initially has asked for further information.

Life will irrevocably change for millions of Latinos in Southern California and beyond because of what the Supreme Court just ruled.","My dad’s passport is among his most valuable possessions, a document that not only establishes that he’s a U.S. citizen but holds the story of his life.

It states that he was born in Mexico in 1951 and is decorated with stamps from the regular trips he takes to his home state of Zacatecas. Its cover is worn but still strong, like its owner, a 74-year-old retired truck driver. It gives Lorenzo Arellano the ability to move across borders, a privilege he didn’t have when he entered the United States for the first time in the trunk of a Chevy as an 18-year-old.

The photo is classic Papi. Stern like old school Mexicans always look in portraits but with joyful eyes that reveal his happy-go-lucky attitude to life. He used to keep the passport in his underwear drawer to make sure he never misplaced it in the clutter of our home.

At the beginning of Trump’s second term, I told Papi to keep the passport on him at all times. Just because you’re a citizen doesn’t mean you’re safe, I told my dad, who favors places — car washes, hardware stores, street vendors, parks, parties — where immigrants congregate and no one cares who has legal status and who doesn’t.

“Exagera,” my dad replied — Trump exaggerates. As a citizen, my dad reasoned he now had rights. He didn’t have to worry like in the old days, when one shout of “¡La migra!” would send him running for the nearest exit of the carpet factory in Santa Ana where he worked back in the 1970s.

Then came Trump’s summer of deportation.

Masked migra swept across Southern California under the pretense of rounding up criminals. In reality, they grabbed anyone they thought looked suspicious, which in Southern California meant brown-skinned Latinos like my father. The feds even nabbed U.S. citizens or detained them for hours before releasing them with no apology. People who had the right to remain in this country were sent to out-of-state detention camps, where government officials made it as difficult as possible for frantic loved ones to find out where they were, let alone retrieve them.

This campaign of terror is why the ACLU and others filed a lawsuit in July arguing that la migra was practicing racial profiling in violation of the 4th Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches. A federal judge agreed, issuing a temporary restraining order. The Trump administration appealed, arguing to the Supreme Court that it needed to racially profile to find people to kick out of the country, otherwise “the prospect of contempt” would hang “over every investigative stop.”

On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed.

In a 6-3 vote, the justices lifted the temporary restraining order as the ACLU lawsuit proceeds. L.A.’s long, hot deportation summer will spill over to the fall and probably last as long as Trump wants it to. The decision effectively states that those of us with undocumented family and friends — a huge swath of Southern California and beyond — should watch over our shoulders, even if we’re in this country legally.

And even if you don’t know anyone without papers, watch out if you’re dark-skinned, speak English with an accent or wear guayaberas or huaraches. Might as well walk around in a T-shirt that says, “DEPORT ME, POR FAVOR.”

The ruling didn’t surprise me — the Supreme Court nowadays is a Trump-crafted rubber stamp for his authoritarian project. But what was especially galling was how out of touch Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion was with reality.

Kavanaugh describes what la migra has wrought on Southern California as “brief investigative stops,” which is like describing a totaled car as a “scratched-up vehicle.” A citizen or permanent resident stopped on suspicion of being in this country illegally “will be free to go after the brief encounter,” he wrote.

The justice uses the words “brief” or “briefly” eight times to describe what la migra does. Not once does he mention plaintiff Brian Gavidia, the U.S. citizen who on June 9 was at a Montebello tow yard when masked immigration agents shoved him against the fence and twisted his arm.

Gavidia’s offense? He stated he was an American three times but couldn’t remember the name of the East L.A. hospital where he was born. A friend recorded the encounter and posted it to social media. It quickly went viral and showed the world that citizenship won’t save you from Trump’s migra hammer.

Would Kavanaugh describe this as a “brief encounter” if it happened to him? To a non-Latino? After more cases like this inevitably happen, and more people are gobbled up by Trump’s anti-immigrant Leviathan?

Anyone who applauds this decision is sanctioning state-sponsored racism out of apartheid-era South Africa. They’re all right with Latinos who “look” a certain way or live in communities with large undocumented populations becoming second-class citizens, whether they just migrated here or can trace their heritage to before the Pilgrims.

I worry for U.S.-born family members who work construction and will undoubtedly face citizenship check-ins. For friends in the restaurant industry who might also become targets. For children in barrios who can now expect ICE and Border Patrol trucks to cruise past their schools searching for adults and even teens to detain — it’s already happened.

Life will irrevocably change for millions of Latinos in Southern California and beyond because of what the Supreme Court just ruled. Shame on Kavanaugh and the five other justices who sided with him for uncorking a deportation demon that will be hard to stop.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor recounts Gavidia’s travails in her dissent, adding that the Real ID he was able to show the agents after they roughed him that established his citizenship “was never returned” and mocking Kavanaugh’s repeated use of “brief.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” she wrote. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

I will also dissent, but now I’m going to be more careful than ever. I’m going to carry my passport at all times, just in case I’m in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even that is no guarantee la migra will leave me alone. It’s not a matter of if but when: I live in a majority Latino city, near a Latino supermarket on a street where the lingua franca is Spanish.

And I’m one of the lucky ones. I will be able to remain, no matter what may happen, because I’m a citizen. Imagine having to live in fear like this for the foreseeable future for those who aren’t?

The justices issued an administrative stay, a temporary measure that allows them more time to review the administration's request to withhold about $4 billion in aid authorized by Congress before the September 30 deadline.

Newsweek reached out to the State Department via contact form and original plaintiffs AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) via email for comment Tuesday afternoon.

Why It Matters

The Trump administration has sought to pull back foreign aid spending since day one of President Donald Trump's second term, when he signed an executive order pausing funds. This raised concerns from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Congress, who had already approved the spending.

What To Know

The one-page order from Chief Justice John Roberts stayed a September 3 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in which Judge Amir Ali had barred the administration from withholding funds.

In its emergency filing to the Supreme Court on Monday, the Trump administration said the ban ""irreparably harms the Executive Branch,"" and that the funds should remain frozen while Congress considers Trump's proposals.

Trump had told House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, in a letter on August 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, inclusive of $900 million in contributions to the United Nations, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what's known as a pocket rescission—a process allowing a president to submit a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to reallocate the approved funds. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window, and the money goes unspent.

The order by Roberts marks the third Supreme Court win this week for Trump, including allowing ICE to stop people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

Roberts also issued an order that permitted the president remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission.

What People Are Saying

Ali, in his last ruling: ""This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds.""

What's Next

Roberts requested further submissions by September 12, with the Supreme Court likely to hear more on the case at a later date.

Around a dozen people urged the three commissioners, all Democrats, to adopt new policies to protect residents from immigration arrests, including posting relevant state and county laws and policies on county buildings and requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to have a judicial warrant to make arrests at county buildings, among other measures.

“The county commissioners share everyone’s outrage,” Commissioner P.T. Wood said. “I’m really sorry that this happened. … We’re going to do everything in our power, which unfortunately, is not very much.”

The Colorado Sun previously reported on the arrests of Carolina Suarez Estrada, 33, whom ICE handcuffed inside the Chaffee County court complex Aug. 19. Her 7-year-old son, Luciano, was detained by ICE later that day.

Footage from body cameras worn by Chaffee County sheriff’s deputies and incident reports obtained by The Sun show the officers responding to a call from a worker in the probation department about Suarez and her partner, Darwin Arriche-Sierra, hiding in an office with a worker while the ICE agents waited in the lobby.

ICE agents said they had attempted to pull over Suarez and Arriche-Sierra when they left the court complex, but the two pulled back into the probation department office and ran inside. ICE agents described this as a crime. The agents said they were initially targeting Arriche-Sierra, who had visited court that day as part of a recent drunken driving case, for immigration violations. But they also told deputies they planned to arrest Suarez for evading them.

Suarez asked a deputy why the men were chasing them, according to the body-camera footage. She told the deputy she had a 7-year-old son in Buena Vista. Arriche-Sierra said ICE was chasing him and asked the deputy if he could leave through another door.

The footage shows that Sheriff Andy Rohrich and deputies urged Suarez and Arriche-Sierra to leave the office, saying they were obstructing government operations. The sheriff and a deputy told the ICE agents to wait outside where Suarez and Arriche-Sierra couldn’t see them so that the agents could arrest them when they left. Suarez and Arriche-Sierra left the office and waited in the lobby, where ICE agents reentered the building and arrested them inside.

Colorado law

Some at Tuesday’s meeting criticized the sheriff and his deputies’ actions during the arrest.

They included Lauren Hansen, a friend of Suarez who drove Luciano to the ICE facility in Alamosa where agents had taken Carolina. Using Suarez’ phone, ICE agents at first urged a family member to take Luciano, but the family member feared he would be arrested too, he said. The Sun is not using his name for fear of retaliation.

The mother and son are being held in a family detention facility in Texas. Arriche-Sierra remains in a detention facility in Aurora, according to ICE’s website.

Suarez faces no pending criminal charges, her lawyer Kymberly Renaud said. Renaud submitted a request Tuesday that Suarez and Luciano be released while her immigration case is pending.

“Leaving a child in limbo while a parent is taken away violates every principle of human decency and cuts against the very spirit of Colorado law,” Hansen said at the commission meeting. “Trust in law enforcement cannot survive when compassion is missing.”

Colorado law prohibits state and local law enforcement from aiding in federal immigration enforcement outside of their criminal enforcement duties. But aiding immigrants could invite federal punishment. Federal prosecutors charged a judge in Wisconsin earlier this year with obstruction after she allegedly allowed an immigrant and his lawyer to leave through a back door.

“I think the sheriff and his team did the best job they could do under a really difficult situation,” Wood, the commissioner, said Tuesday. “There’s one person to blame for this. He lives in the White House in Washington, D.C.”

Rohrich, in an interview Tuesday, said he and the deputies followed Colorado law.

Once the ICE agents told him Suarez and Arriche-Sierra had committed crimes by hiding from the agents, Rohrich said he could not challenge them.

“I can’t challenge federal authorities on their probable cause,” he said. “They told us this is no longer about civil detainment, this is a crime. That’s putting us on the front saying you have to abide now.”

Rohrich said he and his deputies deny ICE requests to arrest people leaving the county jail, known as civil detainers, almost every day.

“If we wanted to cooperate with ICE they’d have 500 (immigrants) already from Chaffee County,” he estimated.

Rohrich urged concerned members of the public to ask his office for the body-camera footage.

“I feel confident we did everything by the book,” he said. “We’re constantly working with immigrants who are victims of crimes, we’re not handing them over to ICE, we’re protecting them.”

“It’s unfortunate this child got caught up in this,” he said of Luciano. “It’s ICE’s responsibility to make sure that child is looked after if they remove the adult from the home.”

ICE is not allowed to arrest people who are going to or coming from a courthouse, per a 2020 Colorado law.

Hans Meyer, an immigration, civil rights and criminal defense lawyer who helped draft the law, said the ICE agents likely violated that state law when they first attempted to pull over Suarez and Arriche-Sierra after they left the court complex.

Later, once Suarez and Arriche-Sierra were hiding in the probation department, Meyer said ICE appears to have been “manipulating around the edges of state law protections to concoct a reason to arrest somebody.”

A 2018 order from the then-chief judge of the 11th Circuit, which covers Chaffee County, that allows for noncriminal arrests on courthouse grounds only if court staff are notified beforehand is still in effect.

Members of the public urged commissioners Tuesday to do more, including requiring judicial warrants from ICE agents who seek to make arrests in county buildings and requiring signs about county policies be posted at county buildings.

“These are some of the measures we could have already put in place to protect a collateral pickup like Carolina Suarez, but we didn’t act quickly enough,” one commenter said. “Please correct that situation as soon as possible, so that we may avoid further traumatizing our valued community members, our coworkers, our friends and our mothers.”

A commenter who identified herself as a youth social worker said her children have played soccer with Luciano, the young boy detained by ICE.

“He is a kind little 7-year-old boy who translated for his classmates, and he’s been put in an ICE detention center,” she said. “He’s going to experience lifelong trauma because of that.”

Wood said the commissioners have reached out to the Colorado Attorney General’s Office to see what more they can do.

“What are our options right now? No one knows,” he said. “We’re not getting good direction. There’s not good advice. There isn’t a simple solution, and there’s not a clean solution.”

A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Commissioner David Armstrong said the commissioners would review the suggestions from the public.

“If there’s areas that we can tighten up or improve on by putting signs on the door, we’ll do that,” he said. “We’re all as U.S. citizens and/or immigrants between a rock and a hard spot, fighting our federal government, and that’s not what this democracy was designed for.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090325-ICE-bodycam.png,N,,2025-09-09 18:57:36.668061

This is a moment for true leadership; to defend the ECHR not just in principle but in practice, and remember that a government’s measure is how it treats the vulnerable.","I have seen first hand how the Human Rights Act, which embeds the ECHR in UK law, empowers ordinary people to challenge injustice and hold the state to account: securing justice for the Hillsborough families; defending domestic abuse victims; upholding rights of disabled people and care home residents during the pandemic. These are not abstract rights, they are lifelines. The ECHR protects whistleblowers and journalists, ensures fair trials, and defends freedom of expression. Withdrawal would align Britain with Russia and Belarus.

In Northern Ireland the stakes are even higher: the Good Friday agreement enshrines the ECHR. Undermining or withdrawing from it risks destabilising a fragile peace.

Scapegoating the ECHR distracts from real solutions. Since 2018 about 68 per cent of small boat arrivals have been granted asylum — people fleeing war, torture and persecution. Sending them back into harm’s way is a moral line we cannot cross.

Reform UK’s promises of mass deportations are fantasy politics.

That undermined the very protections the ECHR guarantees.

After Bartolini illegally procured naturalization, he fraudulently obtained a U.S. passport, falsely stating on his passport application that he was born in Cuba.
Moio Bartolini was arrested and charged with false statement in the application for and use of a passport.
The complaint also charges that Moio Bartolini procured U.S. citizenship through concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation.
The case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security and will be litigated by the Affirmative Litigation Unit of the Civil Division’s Office of Immigration Litigation, General Litigation and Appeals Section.","Today, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida filed a civil denaturalization complaint in the U.S. District Court in Orlando, Florida, against a native of Argentina who illegally procured his U.S. citizenship by gaining permanent resident status through the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act based on a false claim that he was born in Cuba.

“The Justice Department is committed to preserving the integrity of United States citizenship and will aggressively pursue the denaturalization of fraudsters who lie to gain immigration benefits,” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Civil denaturalization is an important tool in ensuring that only qualified individuals with good moral character earn U.S. citizenship. The civil complaint charges that Moio Bartolini exploited our immigration system and unlawfully secured the ultimate immigration benefit of naturalization. The filing of this case sends a clear message: if you do not tell the truth to immigration officials and break our immigration laws, we will prosecute you and denaturalize you.”

In 2013, Fernando Adrian Moio Bartolini, 50, a native of Argentina and resident of Windermere, Florida, was convicted in the Southern District of Florida of committing passport fraud. During criminal proceedings, he admitted that after he entered the United States on a visitor’s visa, purchased a fraudulent Cuban birth certificate, obtained a fraudulent Cuban passport, and applied for permanent resident status in the United States under the Cuban Adjustment Act, claiming that he was a native and citizen of Cuba.

After Bartolini illegally procured naturalization, he fraudulently obtained a U.S. passport, falsely stating on his passport application that he was born in Cuba. His fraud was uncovered when Moio Bartolini attempted to enter the United States at the Miami International Airport aboard a flight from Medellín, Colombia, and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer recognized his Argentinian accent. Moio Bartolini was arrested and charged with false statement in the application for and use of a passport. When he pleaded guilty, he admitted that he was born in Argentina and that he used the fraudulent Cuban documents to adjust status to permanent resident and, ultimately, to naturalize as a U.S. citizen.

The civil denaturalization complaint charges Moio Bartolini with illegal procurement of naturalization because he did not lawfully adjust to permanent resident status and because he provided false testimony in his naturalization interview. The complaint also charges that Moio Bartolini procured U.S. citizenship through concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires the U.S. District Court to revoke Moio Bartolini’s naturalization if it finds him liable on any of the charges.

The case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security and will be litigated by the Affirmative Litigation Unit of the Civil Division’s Office of Immigration Litigation, General Litigation and Appeals Section.

Savage, Michael Wilner, www.latimes.com, david-g-savage, michael-wilner",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-09-09/critics-fault-supreme-court-for-allowing-immigration-stops-that-consider-race-ethnicity,"By a 6-3 vote, the justices set aside a Los Angeles judge’s temporary restraining order that barred agents from stopping people based in part on their race or apparent ethnicity.
“Apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
“Today, the Supreme Court took a step in a badly wrong direction,” Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor, wrote on the Volokh Conspiracy blog.
They also pointed to the data that suggests about 10% of the people in the Los Angeles area are illegally in the United States.
“We don’t arrest somebody or detain somebody without reasonable suspicion.”","Fifty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that U.S. Border Patrol agents violated the Constitution when they stopped a car on a freeway near San Clemente because its occupants appeared to be “of Mexican ancestry.”

The 4th Amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches, the justices said then, and a motorist’s “Mexican appearance” does not justify stopping them to ask about their immigration status.

But the court sounded a decidedly different note on Monday when it ruled for the Trump administration and cleared the way for stopping and questioning Latinos who may be here illegally. By a 6-3 vote, the justices set aside a Los Angeles judge’s temporary restraining order that barred agents from stopping people based in part on their race or apparent ethnicity.

“Apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. “However, it can be a relevant factor when considered along with other salient factors.”

Critics of the ruling said it had opened the door for authorizing racial and ethnic bias.

UCLA law professor Ahilan Arulanantham called it “shocking and appalling. I don’t know of any recent decision like this that authorized racial discrimination.”

Arulanantham noted that Kavanaugh’s writings speak for the justice alone, and that the full court did not explain its ruling on a case that came through its emergency docket.

By contrast, he and others pointed out that the court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. prohibited the use of race or ethnicity as a factor in college admissions.

“Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” Roberts wrote for a 6-3 majority in 2023. That decision struck down the affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.

“Today, the Supreme Court took a step in a badly wrong direction,” Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor, wrote on the Volokh Conspiracy blog. “It makes no sense to conclude that racial and ethnic discrimination is generally unconstitutional, yet also that its use is ‘reasonable’ under the 4th Amendment.”

Reports had already emerged before the decision of ICE agents confronting U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents before they have been able to prove their status, compelling many to begin carrying documentation around at all times.

In New York on Monday, one man outside a federal court was pushed by ICE agents before being able to show them his identification. He was let go.

Asked by The Times to respond to increasing concern among U.S. citizens they could be swept up in expanded ICE raids as a result of the ruling, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that individuals should not be worried.

She added that immigration agents conduct targeted operations with the use of law enforcement intelligence.

“The Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration’s right to stop individuals in Los Angeles to briefly question them regarding their legal status, because the law allows this, and this has been the practice of the federal government for decades,” Leavitt said. “The Immigration and Nationality Act states that immigration officers can briefly stop an individual to question them about their immigration status, if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the individual is illegally present in the United States. And reasonable suspicion is not just based on race — it’s based on a totality of the circumstances.”

On X, the House Homeland Security Committee Democrats responded to Leavitt’s comments, writing: “ICE has jailed U.S. citizens. The Trump Admin is defending racial profiling. Nobody is safe when ‘looking Hispanic’ is treated as probable cause.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent pointed out that nearly half of the residents of Greater Los Angeles are Latino and can speak Spanish.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground and handcuffed because of their looks, their accents, and the fact that they make a living by doing manual labor,” she wrote. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

At issue in the case was the meaning of “reasonable suspicion.”

For decades, the court has said police and federal agents may stop and question someone if they see something specific that suggests they may be violating the law.

But the two sides disagreed over whether agents may stop people because they appear to be Latinos and work as day laborers, at car washes or other low-wage jobs.

President Trump’s lawyers as well as Kavanaugh said agents may make stops based on the “totality of the circumstances” and that may include where people work as well as their ethnicity. They also pointed to the data that suggests about 10% of the people in the Los Angeles area are illegally in the United States.

Tom Homan, the White House border advisor, said that the legal standard of reasonable suspicion “has a group of factors you must take into consideration,” adding, “racial profiling is not happening at all.”

It is a “false narrative being pushed,” Homan told MSNBC in an interview, praising the Supreme Court decision. “We don’t arrest somebody or detain somebody without reasonable suspicion.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bff548c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2Fb0%2Ff97101e54a6189ad8e466b98e130%2F1520409-mla-me-sweater-drive-occupy-ice-la-ces-00291.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:57:40.915448

Watch White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s news briefing in our video player above.

The federal charge comes amid growing questions about why Decarlos Brown Jr. was on the street despite 14 prior criminal cases before he was accused of pulling out a knife and killing 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska in an apparently random attack captured on video. The case has become latest flashpoint in the debate over whether cities such as Charlotte are adequately addressing violent crime, mental illness and transit safety.

Zarutska had come to the United States to escape the war in Ukraine, relatives wrote in a GoFundMe post, describing her as determined to build a safer life.

Brown was arrested at the scene and charged with first-degree murder by North Carolina prosecutors. He now also faces a federal charge of causing death on a mass transportation system, which carries up to life in prison or the death penalty.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the killing was “a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people.”

“We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence — he will never again see the light of day as a free man,” Bondi said in a statement.

The death penalty is a potential punishment for people convicted of first-degree murder in North Carolina. However, the state has not carried out an execution since 2006. Legal challenges over the use of lethal injection drugs and a doctor’s presence at executions have in part delayed action.

Brown had cycled through the criminal justice system for more than a decade, with 14 prior cases in Mecklenburg County, including serving five years for robbery with a dangerous weapon, according to court records. He was arrested earlier this year after repeatedly calling 911 from a hospital, claiming people were trying to control him. A judge released him without bail.

His mother told local television she sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home. Doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia.

Video released Friday shows Zarutska entering the light-rail train and taking a seat in front of Brown, who was seated behind her. Minutes later, without any apparent interaction, he pulls out a pocketknife, stands and slashes her in the neck, investigators said. Passengers scream and scatter as she collapses.

Washington D.C. – In a series of orders, a federal court has intervened to restrict unprecedented data sharing between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), offering temporary relief that will halt the IRS from continuing to share massive amounts of taxpayer data with ICE without providing the court and plaintiffs with 24-hour notice. Last month, in just one day, the IRS disseminated as much taxpayer data to ICE as it had previously shared with all federal law enforcement agencies in a year. After that sharing was made public, a coalition of small businesses, a low-income tax clinic, and two unions represented by Democracy Forward filed an emergency motion to challenge this dangerous data sharing.

In orders issued today and Friday, the court found that while the motion is pending, no confidential taxpayer data may be shared by the IRS with ICE without giving the court and plaintiffs 24 hours advance notice so that either may take further action. These court orders will prevent more egregious sharing of confidential taxpayer information while the court considers the request for preliminary relief. This data sharing is just one consequence of the IRS’s adoption of a new, unlawful data policy that imperils hundreds of millions of Americans’ sensitive personal data. The court has also ordered the IRS to produce a record of its actions for the court to consider whether the IRS acted in an arbitrary and unlawful manner.

The organizations working to defend privacy in Center for Taxpayer Rights et al. v Internal Revenue Service et al include the Center for Taxpayer Rights, Main Street Alliance, Communications Workers of America, and the National Federation of Federal Employees.

“This unlawful data sharing is one of the worst attacks on Americans’ personal privacy in decades and ignores laws Congress passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal to protect taxpayer information,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “The Trump-Vance administration’s actions to share taxpayers’ most confidential data with ICE are a betrayal of the promises our government has made to Americans, and they threaten the people’s trust in the tax system. We are grateful the court has issued this interim order to stop the threats to core privacy rights while the court considers a more formal order. Democracy Forward is honored to represent this broad coalition to hold the administration accountable and protect the privacy of the American people.”

The advocacy group Rural and Migrant Ministry has said most of the people detained at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant were from Guatemala. It happened the same day immigration authorities detained 475 people at a manufacturing site in Georgia where Korean automaker Hyundai makes electric vehicles.

Sarcone told a news conference that the investigation in New York was continuing.

“We will aggressively pursue criminal investigations against those who violate our laws by employing non-citizens without authorization. There will be consequences. The bad old days of turning a blind eye are over,” Sarcone said.

Factory owners said last week that their employees had legal documentation and that they did not know why they were raided.

Calls seeking comment were made to the factory Tuesday and an email seeking comment was sent to a co-owner.

Federal agents converged on the nutrition bar plant Thursday morning and took workers away in a Border Patrol van, according to photos and videos of the raid. One worker told The Associated Press that immigration agents ordered everyone to a lunch room, where they asked for proof they are in the country legally.

Democratic elected officials called it an example of heavy-handed immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Gov. Kathy Hochul said detaining parents put “at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house.”

Maywood Mayor Nathaniel George Booker released a statement Tuesday, outlining resources and services for residents.

""The Village of Maywood stands united with Illinois and Cook County at this critical moment in defense of democracy. We have communicated in partnership with the county that uninvited, unwanted and unjustified visited from ICE is unwelcomed.

Among the resources highlighted in the statement were:

Cook County telehealth services

The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights hotline

Cook County Legal Aid for Housing & Debt assistance

The backstory:

The warning comes as President Donald Trump has renewed his focus on Chicago and Illinois, repeatedly citing violent crime as justification for tougher federal intervention.

Over the weekend, Trump pointed to recent shootings in Chicago and doubled down on plans to target immigration enforcement. He also defended a Truth Social post featuring an AI-generated image of himself styled as a Vietnam War movie character with the caption ""Chipocalypse Now,"" a post that critics said threatened deportations and military action in the city.

When pressed, Trump said his administration’s approach was about ""cleaning up cities,"" not war. Still, he has suggested deploying the National Guard to Chicago, calling it ""a mess.""

Big picture view:

Maywood is the latest suburb to launch a ""know your rights"" campaign regarding immigration enforcement. Other surrounding areas to issue similar statements include Berwyn, Evanston and Cook County among others.

The Trump administration is, once again, using crime as a pretext to carry out its anti-immigrant agenda. In this case, officials are claiming that Operation Midway Blitz is in honor of Illinois resident Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving accident about 100 miles outside of Chicago, allegedly caused by a person who was undocumented.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” DHS said on X. “President Trump and Secretary Noem stand with the victims of illegal alien crime while Governor Pritzker stands with criminal illegal aliens.”

The DHS press release announcing Operation Midway Blitz contains no details about what it will entail, although news reports and officials’ statements have provided more information.

In a social media post on Tuesday, DHS announced: “Operation Midway Blitz will FLOOD THE ZONE with DHS law enforcement in Chicago. @POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have a clear message: no city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

Days before DHS’s announcement, Trump posted to social media a bizarre play on the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now, in what appeared to be a threat to declare war on Chicago. (Trump later claimed he only wanted to “clean up” the city, not go to war with it.)

“I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” the post states over an image of Trump as the movie’s lead character with a helicopter and billowing smoke behind him and “Chipocalypse Now” scrawled across the bottom.

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” the post reads, referencing the Department of Defense’s recent name change.

Illinois’s elected officials, community leaders, and city residents have roundly rejected Trump’s attacks on Chicago, which has seen a record decline in crime in recent years.

“We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) posted on X, adding that the city did not receive notice of DHS’s so-called operation.

The mayor then detailed the administration’s abuses against immigrants who are detained, stating, “[t]here are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) also pushed back, posting on X, “this isn’t about fighting crime,” and that the “Trump Administration is focused on scaring Illinoisians.”

Community members and local leaders have held protests, press conferences, and meetings to protect their city from federal agents and, potentially, military troops.

“There is no emergency justifying these harsh and destabilizing operations — other than the Trump Administration’s authoritarian impulses to attack communities that do not support his unpopular and harsh immigration policies,” ACLU of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka told Truthout in an email.

Community members have confirmed that several abductions have already occurred. One of the people taken was a local flower vendor, according to WGN News. Surveillance video shows a man detained by people who appear to be federal agents wearing bulletproof vests, the outlet reported. One of the agents was wearing a Donald Trump-shaped pin.

“This is the type of racial ethnic profiling that is going on,” Illinois Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D) told WGN News. “They didn’t have a court order to come and pick up someone who sells flowers.”

Brandon Lee, director of communications for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), condemned the recent raids in Chicago in an email to Truthout.

“Since the start of last week we have seen the Trump administration escalate its terror campaign on our neighbors and our city,” Lee said, adding that ICIRR is committed to “making sure our community members in Illinois know their rights, and know the resources available to them,” which includes the Family Support Hotline at 855-435-7693.

“The hotline sends called-in tips to our network of Rapid Response Teams who verify ICE presence, and operators offer support to families whose loved ones have been taken,” Lee said.

“No matter how much he tries to make this seem like a narrow operation, Trump’s attacks are broad based and meant to target all immigrants — from grandparents in Albany Park, to flower vendors on Archer Avenue,” Lee continued. “This is a moment when people all across Chicagoland are coming together to reject Trump’s impending occupation and commit to looking out for all of our neighbors.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2233493193-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:57:06.349165

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unveiled the immigration operation with a nearly five-minute video featuring Michelle and Joe Abraham, whose 20-year-old daughter Katie was killed in a hit-and-run crash in Urbana in January. The alleged driver, a Guatemalan national, was arrested in Texas a few days later.

DHS Assistant Secretary [for Public Affairs] Tricia McLaughlin said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation ​“will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,” even though the libertarian CATO Institute revealed in June that 65% of immigrants booked by the agency under Trump had no criminal convictions and over 93% were never convicted of violent offenses.

Like Trump has in recent days, McLaughlin took aim at Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, saying that he ​“and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago’s streets — putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals.”

""If President Trump had listened to the city's leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,"" wrote Mayor Brandon Johnson.

While Chicagoans have made their thoughts on a federal invasion clear, carrying signs that said ​“No Trump! No Troops!” and ​“No Nazis — No Kings” during a weekend protest, McLaughlin said that Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ​“have a clear message: No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

Pritzker and Chicago’s Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson, have forcefully pushed back against Trump’s threats to launch a major anti-migrant operation in the city and possibly deploy the National Guard, as he has done in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, California.

In a New York Times opinion piece published hours before the widely anticipated DHS announcement, Johnson argued that ​“lowering crime rates here does not require an occupation of our city by armed members of the National Guard, as the White House continues to threaten us with. Chicagoans, including survivors of violence, have spoken out against such an extreme measure.”

“If President Trump had listened to the city’s leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,” wrote the mayor, who signed an executive order ahead of the federal operation and is raising a family in Austin on the West Side, ​“one of the parts of our city where gun violence is most pervasive.”

“My administration has managed to make progress in crime reduction with three interconnected strategies: effective and law-abiding policing, violence prevention, and addressing the root causes of crime,” Johnson explained. ​“Our violence prevention work includes programs that employ former gang members to de-escalate conflicts as well as initiatives that connect people to jobs and resources.”

“We have directed funding to neighborhoods that have suffered from chronic disinvestment to create jobs, provide mental health services, and more. We are on track to build, rehab, or preserve over 10,000 units of affordable housing,” he continued. ​“We don’t need the National Guard; we just need to invest in what works.”

In a statement, Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates acknowledged ​“the successful efforts of our mayor in reducing crime and investing in our community,” and similarly stressed that whatever Trump is ​“spending on his raids is better spent on building affordable housing, reopening school libraries, and funding social workers to support children through the trauma this administration is inflicting on an entire generation who are worried every day if they will ever see their parents again.”

“As a history teacher, I can tell you that history will not look kindly on Donald Trump or the individuals who are acting as his personal army,” Davis Gates also said. ​“For weeks, the people of Chicago have made it clear that we do not need federal agents in our city whether that is to separate immigrant families or racially profile in our Black neighborhoods.”

“Chicago might have been built to keep our communities divided, but we are coming together now, like working people do against any bad boss, in radical solidarity to keep each other safe,” the union leader added. ​“Donald Trump and his departments of alphabet boys and National Guard troops aren’t welcome and aren’t needed in Chicago.”

Congressional Democrats who represent Illinois have also denounced the president’s targeting of the country’s third-largest city — including Sen. Dick Durbin, who took to the chamber’s floor on Monday following the DHS announcement. Durbin accused Trump of attacking Chicago for ​“political theater.”

While the Trump administration hasn’t yet provided any update on the involvement of the National Guard, after the president moved to rename the U.S. Department of Defense, he took to his Truth Social platform on Saturday morning with an image referencing the 1979 film Apocalypse Now and said, ​“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

Appearing on CBS News’ ​“Face the Nation” on Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), said that ​“we don’t have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago,” but also that ​“the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal… This is not acceptable behavior.”

Responding to the recent developments in a Monday statement, Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the national advocacy group America’s Voice, said that ​“we have gone from a supposed war on immigrants to a war on Americans.”

“America’s Voice has long said that immigration was merely the ​‘tip of the spear’ for this administration to justify and lead an attack on all of us — including violating due process, constitutional rights and core democratic norms and pillars, such as deploying the military against American communities,” she noted. ​“Sadly, all are coming to pass.”

Cárdenas continued: ​“Why is the American president openly threatening an American city, as he readies the deployment of American troops against those residents? It’s not about immigration, just as the Washington, DC deployment wasn’t about crime. Instead, it’s for purposes of retribution; sowing fear and dissent; provoking violence and dividing us as a nation.”

“Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court just sided with the president and his plans to target indiscriminately and racially profile with impunity, effectively making racial profiling now the law of the land,” she added, citing a Monday decision. ​“Whether calling it ​‘authoritarianism’ or something else, it’s clear we are fighting not just for immigrants, but also for a different vision of America that’s now imperiled.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/itt-images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GettyImages-2233503222.jpg?mtime=1757439429,N,,2025-09-09 16:57:03.176984

The ruling allows federal immigration agents to stop and detain people solely based on their race or ethnicity, or the fact that they’re speaking Spanish or have an accent, or because they’re sitting outside a place like Home Depot waiting for day labor work.

Critics say it’s blatant racial profiling that makes anyone with brown skin suspect. But the Trump administration celebrated the ruling as a victory for the rule of law in their mission to carry out the president’s mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.

That said, this is a temporary ruling. It means the government can continue to use these aggressive tactics in immigration sweeps as the court process plays out. And it’s having ripple effects across immigrant communities.

For more about the potential impact of this ruling here, The Show turned to longtime Arizona civil rights attorney Stephen Montoya.

Full conversation

LAUREN GILGER: Good morning, Stephen. Thanks for coming on.

STEPHEN MONTOYA: Good morning. Thank you.

GILGER: So what is your reaction to this Supreme Court ruling?

MONTOYA: Well, I'm not very happy about it. I'm somewhat surprised by it, because this really does overturn — even though it purports not to — long-term precedents that have been governing this area of law really for probably almost three decades. So, that's why I'm surprised.

Here's why I'm not surprised. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has really rubber stamped a series of expansions of executive power and the nationalization of federal law enforcement. And even more troubling the militarization of national law enforcement. And really that is something that is virtually unique in American history. And it's especially troubling because one of the reasons why there was an American Revolution and there was a constitutional convention in 1787 and there was a ratification of the Constitution that resulted from the convention was because of a militaristic foreign police force in America. It was called the English Army, that was really terrorizing the citizens and imposing a dictatorship upon the people.

We're not close to a dictatorship upon the people. However, the expansion of federal law enforcement, the militarization of the National Guard, potentially nationally to enforce domestic law, coupled with the president who two terms ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled was immune — criminally immune — he was already civilly immune, from acts done in the scope of his office. All those things combined really do result in a profound change in the constitutional makeup of the United States.

GILGER: Let me ask you, Stephen, about what we're talking about here in Arizona. Like we're talking about immigration enforcement, racial profiling. And it sounds a lot like the debate around SB 1070 more than a decade ago, which was, you know, largely overturned then by the U.S. Supreme Court. That, of course, had to do with local law enforcement. This has to do with federal immigration agents. But you were involved obviously in the litigation against 1070. Are you seeing these similarities?

MONTOYA: Yeah, and before that back in the ‘90s, I was involved in a lawsuit against the city of Chandler, who conducted a municipal immigration raid in downtown Chandler that was also unconstitutional. Yeah, yeah, it is very similar. However, this is worse — because remember 1070 was a state law, as you pointed out. So it really was confined to Arizona.

And also remember the United States, the Obama administration sued the state of Arizona. And in United States vs. Arizona, the United States Supreme Court said that 1070 was unconstitutional, because the state could not just declare itself to have the authority to enforce federal immigration law. So, this is actually worse, because this is the federal government doing it. And the federal government is actually doing it not only in Los Angeles, but also in Washington, D.C., and virtually across the country.

So it's much broader in scope. And, moreover, unlike 1070, really, you know — which, it didn't involve the National Guard. See to federalize the National Guard and to use the National Guard as a police force to enforce immigration law is a very troubling and, in my opinion, dangerous precedent. ..

GILGER: So let me, let me ask you about the Trump administration's argument here though, Stephen, like some of the conservative Supreme Court justices who ruled on this say that you can't kind of hang the prospect of being held in contempt of court over these agents as they're trying to do their job. That it's reasonable to allow agents to rely on their experience to sort of target folks who might be undocumented. What do you make of that argument?

MONTOYA: Well, you know, I think it has some plausibility. And I personally am against illegal immigration. And I believe that everyone has to obey the law. I can't move to Mexico without seeking the authorization of the Mexican government in advance. And that's the Republic of Mexico's right to keep me out of Mexico should it choose to do so. So I support immigration enforcement.

However, I also support people's individual rights. And it's true, you know — I read Justice Kavanaugh's concurring opinion because of course the majority didn't render an opinion. They rendered an order without briefing, without oral argument, and without any justification for the order.

But I do get it. 10% of the residents of Los Angeles County are undocumented. That is an alarming amount. And it is true that a lot of them are from South America. So a lot of them appear physically to be Latino or Hispanic or Mexican or South American. A lot of them speak Spanish. A lot of them are manual laborers. A lot of them dress like manual laborers, and a lot of them are undocumented.

But unfortunately, for the law in due process, a lot of native-born Americans fall into that category, and Arizona is a great example. Douglas, part of Douglas, is in the United States and the other half of Douglas is across the street in Mexico. There are a lot of communities in Arizona like that, and there are a lot of native-born citizens who meet all of those characteristics that the Supreme Court has now authorized the federal government to stop and demand proof of citizenship.

I was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It's the oldest capital in the United States. It's older than Mexico. It's older than the United States. I don't carry around my birth certificate.

Pence said that he called the DHS tipline to file complaints against the provider.
Mohamod repeatedly denied Pence’s allegations, adding that care services billed to the State of Minnesota on his behalf were provided.","Cain Pence reached out to 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS, alleging that his taxpayer-funded provider wasn’t always helping with daily care assistance, and he was concerned if the state was being billed.

Pence relies on assistance from the Minnesota Department of Human Services’ Integrated Community Supports (ICS) program for daily care and housing needs.

The ICS program helps over 1,000 vulnerable Minnesotans daily through a variety of providers, according to the state. “I’m physically hurting, but I’m sharp mentally,” Pence said.

Last year, Pence alleged that his provider wasn’t giving him the full care that he was entitled to through the ICS program.

“I’d say, ‘Hey, I need help with these things.’ … ‘do it yourself,’” recalled Pence when he asked sometimes for help.

Pence said that he called the DHS tipline to file complaints against the provider.

Pence shared two copies of letters with 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS that he received from the Minnesota Department of Human Services’ Office of Inspector General in response to the complaints filed in October and May. In a letter dated May 27, the DHS Office of Inspector General’s Megan Kleineck wrote in part, “After carefully reviewing all the information you provided and gathering some additional information, your report was referred to the Program Integrity Oversight Division with the Department of Human Services for fraud review.”

In an Aug. 29 email to 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS, DHS wrote in part, “To protect the integrity of our investigations, we do not disclose active fraud investigations unless the DHS Commissioner determines it will not impede the investigation. We cannot confirm if there is an active investigation into American Home Health Care LLC.”

At the time, the state did confirm “…there are current open licensing complaints against this provider.”

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to the care company by email to get their side of the story and then went to the address listed for their Maple Grove offices.

Jama Mohamod, who oversees the provider mentioned in Pence’s allegations, agreed to speak with reporter Eric Chaloux.

“I’m just asking about the allegations he raised that there were services he wasn’t provided during the time he was there,” Chaloux questioned.

“He do that, he do that, that guy he complaining … all his life he’s been complaining,” Mohamod said.

Mohamod repeatedly denied Pence’s allegations, adding that care services billed to the State of Minnesota on his behalf were provided.

Since 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS first reached out to DHS, we found a corrective order in late August, which was the result of a state investigation.

DHS issued a correction order against American Home Maker Services, which operates under the state license of American Home Health Care LLC, alleging violations of licensing statutes at the complex where Pence used to live in Minnetonka.

The Aug. 27 correction order lists the number of a complaint report — that same number matches the report number found on the Office of Inspector General’s October letter to Pence.

DHS alleges a violation of Minnesota Statutes, saying, “… the license holder did not provide services as assigned in the support plan that complied with the requirements of this chapter and the federal waiver plans as required.”

The provider was given time to dispute the state’s allegations listed in the corrective order.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has learned Republicans on the Minnesota House committee who investigate allegations of fraud in state government say they’ve “flagged” the ICS program for a deeper look.

The committee staff have met with Pence to investigate his situation.",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/10P-PKG-ICS-PROGRAM-FRAUD_KSTP3053_184_mxf_00.00.22.26.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:57:14.284887

With reports from across the country of ICE indiscriminately arresting and detaining individuals and Border Czar Tom Homan’s warning of “more collateral arrests,” Governor Pritzker met with ICIRR and its member organizations to discuss their work to protect the Constitutional Rights of Illinois residents. To combat tactics that leave communities at risk of having their rights violated, the state supports Illinois’ strong network of community organizations that provide legal and services support.

“Many families who have lived in Illinois for years are fearful to pick up their kids from school, go to work, and live their lives freely,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “At such an uncertain moment for our immigrant communities, it is more important than ever that people know their rights and have someone looking out for them. We are fortunate to have a strong network of immigrant rights organizations working to keep our neighbors informed and protecting their rights. I commend the volunteers and staff on the front-line for leading this critical work.”

During his visit, Governor Pritzker toured BPNC offices, where he met and heard from the organization’s rapid response team, ICIRR’s Family Support Network hotline operators, and other staff providing citizenship and public benefits assistance. As the Trump Administration ramps up its presence in Chicago and surrounding communities, these resources are critical in ensuring that community members know their rights and have access to legal services, and that the actions of federal officials are monitored to identify unlawful tactics.

Following the tour, Governor Pritzker then joined a roundtable with leaders from ICIRR member organizations to hear directly about the impact of federal overreach on immigrant families, including some of the harrowing stories of families being ripped apart, U.S. citizens being detained, and other inhumane tactics being used by the Trump administration. During the roundtable, Governor Pritzker reiterated the state’s commitment to supporting the organizations that protect the Constitutional Rights of Illinois residents and encouraged community members to document enforcement activities and speak out.

He concluded the day with a visit to the National Museum of Mexican Art, lifting up Illinois’ rich Mexican immigrant community and their cultural contributions as the city prepares for the annual celebration of Mexican Independence Day that the Trump administration threatens to also disrupt.

While the Trump Administration continues to target and vilify immigrant communities, Governor Pritzker has worked alongside immigrant organizations and lawmakers to implement humane policies that support Illinoisans. ​

Immigrants are essential to Chicago’s economy, culture, and communities. In the Chicago metro area, an estimated 1.86 million immigrants make up 19% of the population, contributing $66.2 billion in annual spending power and $23.7 billion in taxes, according to FWD.US.

Overruling Humphrey’s Executor would be an unprecedented shift in the balance of power between the president and the administrative state.","Earlier this month, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled President Trump’s removal of Democrat commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was unlawful. In a 2-1 decision, the panel held that the case was squarely controlled by Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor. The D.C. Circuit decision upheld the district court’s ruling in July and sets the stage for the Supreme Court to determine whether to uphold or overrule long-standing precedent regarding removal protections for “independent” executive agencies.

On Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts granted the Trump administration’s request and stayed the D.C. Circuit’s decision pending further orders from Roberts or the Supreme Court, which effectively removes Rebecca Slaughter (again) from her role as an FTC commissioner. The stay order directs Slaughter to respond to the administration’s appeal by September 15. During her brief reinstatement, Slaughter dissented from several FTC actions.

Supreme Court Likely to Decide Scope of Administrative Agencies’ Independence

As we previously discussed, the Trump administration has fired individuals from administrative agencies that historically enjoyed protections against at-will removal, such as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In all three cases, the lower courts had ruled those removals unlawful according to the governing statutes and Supreme Court precedent.

In May, the Supreme Court stepped in and stayed the NLRB and MSPB decisions pending litigation, allowing the removals to take effect. Then in July, the Supreme Court allowed the CSPC removals to take effect and cited to its interim order in the NLRB/MSPB decision, reiterating that “our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”

Humphrey’s Executor on the Chopping Block?

In the FTC case, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged the Supreme Court’s stay orders permitting those removals pending litigation but distinguished them from the FTC, as those cases “presented the never-before-decided question of whether Humphrey’s Executor should be extended to the statutes providing for-cause removal protection to those officials.” In contrast, Humphrey’s Executor specifically addressed and upheld the FTC’s removal protections. Thus, the D.C. Circuit determined it was bound by Humphrey’s Executor until the Supreme Court expressly overrules the 1935 precedent.

While the Supreme Court has so far avoided ruling on the agency removal cases on the merits, the FTC’s case is almost certain to force the justices to decide whether Humphrey’s Executor remains good law. Overruling Humphrey’s Executor would be an unprecedented shift in the balance of power between the president and the administrative state.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16153_4556.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:57:12.517550

… “For the foregoing reasons, dos Santos’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.
… The respondents are further ordered to file a status report on or before August 18, 2025, confirming that dos Santos has been released from custody.” Dos Santos v. Noem, et al.","Where a habeas corpus petitioner has requested an order of immediate release from detention, that request should be granted because 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2) does not mandate the detention of a noncitizen like the petitioner who has been released on bond pursuant to Section 1226, is in the midst of standard removal proceedings, and is otherwise subject to Section 1226(a)’s discretionary detention framework.

“Petitioner Adriano Maia dos Santos, a citizen of Brazil, has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §2241 seeking an order of immediate release from detention. In October 2017, dos Santos was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (‘CBP’) officers and placed in expedited removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1) after crossing into the United States between ports of entry. Dos Santos claimed a fear of returning to Brazil, which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (‘USCIS’) found credible. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) consequently filed a Notice to Appear in Immigration Court, thus terminating dos Santos’ expedited removal proceedings and commencing standard removal proceedings against him under 8 U.S.C. §1229a. In January 2018, pursuant to a stipulation between dos Santos and the Department of Homeland Security, an Immigration Judge ordered dos Santos released on bond after conducting a custody redetermination hearing under 8 U.S.C. §1226. For over seven years, dos Santos resided in the United States subject to that bond.

“On May 30, 2025, following a traffic stop, ICE officers arrested dos Santos pursuant to a warrant, ordered him detained under 8 U.S.C. §1226, and cancelled his bond. …

“Dos Santos’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus contends that he is not lawfully detained under Section 1225(b) and requests that the Court order his immediate release from detention. The government responds that although dos Santos is in removal proceedings and was arrested on a warrant citing Section 1226, he is, and has always been, subject to mandatory detention under Section 1225(b)(2). For the reasons articulated in Gomes v. Hyde, No. 25-cv-11571-JEK, 2025 WL 1869299 (D. Mass. July 7, 2025), the Court disagrees. The government’s argument contravenes the plain text of Section 1226(a) and would render superfluous Section 1226(c), which mandates the detention of certain noncitizens and is the sole exception to Section 1226(a)’s discretionary framework. Because dos Santos was arrested on a warrant and ordered detained under Section 1226, his detention continues to be governed by Section 1226(a)’s discretionary framework. The Court will, accordingly, grant his petition and order that he be immediately released from detention, subject to the Immigration Judge’s 2018 bond order. …

“The central question posed by dos Santos’ habeas petition is whether he is lawfully detained under Section 1225(b)(2), as the government now contends, or is instead subject to discretionary detention under Section 1226(a), as the government represented in its Notice of Custody Determination. …

“… Thus, the question is whether Section 1225(b)(2) mandates the detention of a noncitizen, like dos Santos, who has been released into the United States on bond pursuant to Section 1226, is in the midst of standard removal proceedings, and is otherwise subject to Section 1226(a)’s discretionary detention framework.

“For the reasons explained by this Court in Gomes v. Hyde, the answer to that question is no. …

“The government has not argued, much less presented any evidence to suggest, that ICE’s decision to unilaterally cancel the Immigration Judge’s 2018 bond order was justified by ‘a change of circumstance.’ … Rather than basing its decision on dos Santos’ own conduct and circumstances, ICE appears to have cancelled his bond for no reason other than the fact that it encountered him by chance while conducting a traffic stop. … The government has, accordingly, failed to carry its burden to show that a change in circumstances supported its decision to revoke the Immigration Judge’s 2018 bond order. … Unless and until ICE carries that burden at a hearing before an Immigration Judge, dos Santos must be released from custody subject to the 2018 bond order. …

“For the foregoing reasons, dos Santos’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §2241, ECF 1, is granted. The respondents are ordered to release dos Santos from the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement within 48 hours of the entry of this Memorandum and Order, subject to the Immigration Judge’s January 23, 2018 bond order. … The respondents are further ordered to file a status report on or before August 18, 2025, confirming that dos Santos has been released from custody.”

“Over the first five weeks of Operation Legend in Chicago, murders dropped by 50% over the previous five weeks,” Barr said.","WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security kicked off a crackdown on illegal immigrants in Chicago Monday — after local Democrats spent the weekend protesting President Trump’s threat of a federal law enforcement surge in America’s third-largest city.

“DHS is launching Operation Midway Blitz in honor of Katie Abraham who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by criminal illegal alien Julio Cucul-Bol in Illinois,” the department announced on X.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew [Democratic] Governor [JB] Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The statement concluded: “President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem stand with the victims of illegal alien crime while Governor Pritzker stands with criminal illegal aliens.”

Later in the day, DHS took the unusual step of identifying 11 illegal immigrants believed to be in Chicago — tweeting out their photos, names and rap sheets — in an attempt to frame coverage of the mission.

The wanted list includes Pedro Gonzalez, 34, of Venezuela, described as a “Tren De Aragua gang member with a past criminal history of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, sexual assault, domestic battery, and kidnapping.”

“He was released multiple times despite ICE lodging a detainer,” the post says.

Abdul Al Kaby, 60, of Iraq was described as having “convictions for felonious assault, assault with a deadly weapon, and murder/intent to kill.”

“Al Kaby had an order for removal by an immigration judge in 1997 but was repeatedly released from Illinois jails despite ICE detainers,” DHS said.

ICE has been positioning staff to carry out operations in the Windy City for more than a week, leading sources to say that a crackdown was imminent.

“For years, Democrat politicians looked the other way while criminal illegal aliens terrorized American communities — even embracing ‘sanctuary’ policies to protect these sick criminals. No more,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.

“The Trump Administration is committed to arresting and deporting these dangerous criminal illegal aliens and Operation Midway Blitz, honoring Katie Abraham who was killed by a criminal illegal alien, will make Illinois communities safer.”

The mission is separate from a possible federal law enforcement intervention against common street crime — and Trump has vacillated in public remarks about whether he will order a surge of agents to the City of Big Shoulders.

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, also a Democrat, reacted with outrage over the weekend at the president using a meme to tease the immigration raids.

The “Apocalypse Now”-themed image, titled “Chipocalypse Now,” depicted Trump as a military commander with helicopters, fires and the Chicago skyline looming in the background.

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning…’ Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” the Saturday social media post said, playing off Robert Duvall’s “I love the small of napalm in the morning” riff in Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War-set masterpiece.

Trump indicated Monday morning that the ICE raids do not portend a broader policing intervention.

“We’d love to go into Chicago,” Trump said in a speech touching on religious liberty and other topics. “We’re waiting for a call from Chicago.”

Trump did pressure city leaders, however, over the fact that six people were murdered over the weekend.

“This would mean that over the past number of weeks, approximately 50 people were killed, and hundreds were shot, many expected to die,” the president wrote on Truth Social.

“Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn’t want Federal Government HELP! WHY??? What is wrong with this guy, and the 5% in Polls Mayor. I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them. Only the Criminals will be hurt!”

Pritzker fired back: “‘I want to help people, not hurt them,’ says the guy who just threatened an American city with the Department of War.”

“The City of Chicago received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration,” Johnson said in a statement.

“We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.”

The ICE mission in Chicago follows Trump’s wholesale policing takeover in DC, where he federalized the local police force and deployed the National Guard Aug. 11 and federal agents four days earlier to crack down on violent crime and illegal immigrants.

Trump previously surged federal officers into major cities, including Chicago, in 2020 as part of the multi-agency Operation Legend.

Then-Attorney General Bill Barr said at a September 2020 press conference that the feds had arrested 500 people in five weeks and halved the murder rate in Chicago.

“Over the first five weeks of Operation Legend in Chicago, murders dropped by 50% over the previous five weeks,” Barr said. “August ultimately saw a 45% decrease in murders compared to July, and a 35% decrease compared to June.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/trump-chicago-immigrants-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-09 15:56:44.794556

Immigrant rights, labor, and community groups are condemning the operation as a “ruthless crackdown that resembled a military operation” and are calling for joint accountability from both the government and the corporations involved.

Migrant Equity Southeast (MESE) and its partner organizations, who are providing aid to the detained workers, held a press conference on September 8th in Savannah to strongly condemn the operation. The organization alleged that “ICE agents sealed off the site using military-grade weapons, helicopters, drones, and armored vehicles” and condemned the operation as a “military-style action targeting civilian workers, not a simple workplace check.”

According to MESE, the foreign workers who were arrested were put on buses, had their phones confiscated, and were pressured to sign documents without legal counsel.

MESE Executive Director Daniela Rodriguez stated, “All workers, regardless of their status, including pregnant women, were intimidated, and families were torn apart.” She added, “The people who are building our society’s future should not be treated this way.”

Scapegoating Workers

In statements, ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) confirmed that 475 people were detained on September 4 at Hyundai’s “Metaplant” construction site in Ellabell, Georgia. “A significant number of those detained are South Korean nationals who were either unlawfully present in the U.S. or working in violation of their visa status. This action followed months of investigation and was carried out under a court-issued warrant.”

The operation also involved the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Witnesses reported that agents used chains and zip ties to restrain workers, leaving many shocked and fearful.

One Korean worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Many of those arrested were unable to retrieve their phones. The worksite was shut down, offices were closed, and chaos spread as no one could communicate.”

Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition (KAC), pointed to the failure of the immigration system as the root cause of the incident. She emphasized that “highly specialized technicians” were needed to operate the plant, but that “visas were not issued on the required scale.”

According to HSI, most of the Koreans detained were dispatched engineers, subcontractor employees, or locally hired staff working at the construction site. They had entered the U.S. on short-term business visas (B1/B2) or under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), rather than formal work visas.

Only 85,000 H-1Bs are issued by the U.S. annually, with hundreds of thousands of applicants competing in a lottery system. This makes it difficult for foreign companies to secure visas for specialized staff. As a result, many firms have relied on business visas for short-term technical support or training, a practice long considered routine.

Park said, “Despite both corporations and government leaders understanding this reality, they are now making workers scapegoats as soon as a problem arises.”

Political, Economic Fallout

In a statement, President Trump stressed, “Foreign companies investing in America must respect our immigration laws,” also noting that the U.S. “needs foreign experts to help train American workers in advanced manufacturing.”

Trump added that he is open to streamlining legal pathways for skilled foreign professionals but insisted that “American jobs and security come first.”

But analysts warn the crackdown could have far-reaching consequences for Korean corporate operations and investments in the United States. In an environment of hardening anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S., the operation underscores that even companies from allied nations are not immune to politically charged enforcement.

Reports suggest that since the raid, workers at other sites—including Kia’s Georgia plant and Hyundai facilities in Alabama and Tennessee—have skipped shifts amid rumors of further ICE inspections, leading to production delays.

“Even those with legal status were treated like criminals,” said one community member.

Parents are particularly concerned about the safety of their children. “Some are debating whether to send kids to school, fearing they may face bullying or hate crimes after news spread that so many Koreans were arrested,” one attorney assisting families reported.

Calls for Solidarity

With a significant number of both Korean and Latino workers detained, there is a growing sense all communities are being impacted. “Injustice against one community is injustice against us all,” said Park, who called for “all communities to stand in solidarity so that no one faces this injustice alone.”

The legality and procedural integrity of the raid are also being questioned. Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, stated, “Individual rights must not be violated,” and noted that they are working to “determine to what extent the federal government and employers have violated the rights of the workers.”

Currently, MESE is providing emergency support to affected families and is preparing to offer legal assistance, including setting up legal clinics. The organizations are urging state and federal legislators to conduct a thorough investigation into the raid, hold corporations accountable for labor abuses, and establish legal protections to keep families together and ensure worker safety.

“If we stay silent, we are condoning injustice,” Park said. “We must act together to show that America protects both the rule of law and the dignity of people.”

The Trump administration’s federal law enforcement surge in the District has focused heavily on immigration. And while there are conflicting reports about stepped-up enforcement in Maryland and Virginia, the entire region is bracing for a October, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) gets a massive infusion of funding allocated by Congress.

Our regional politics team share their reporting from D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, including the limits of so-called ‘sanctuary city’ policies and conditions at the ICE processing center in Chantilly, Virginia.

Washington DC

Last month, President Trump called for a surge in federal law enforcement to address what he called a crime crisis in the District. But on the ground, much of the focus of the surge has been on immigrants.

Federal officials have said that a substantial portion of all the arrests taking place have been related to immigration: Up to 40 percent of all arrests at one point. These have often come in the form of traffic stops, where Metropolitan Police Department officers work directly with ICE or other immigration agents to check on a driver’s status as they also look for traffic violations or a criminal record.

This is a substantial change from past practice, as MPD was previously limited in how it could work with ICE. A 2020 law restricts police from telling ICE someone’s status if they’re stopped for any reason or from transporting people on ICE’s behalf. But D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith’s recent order would allow cops to do these things, though officers would still be barred from making arrests solely on immigration status

Trump has tried to push these boundaries even further, however, attempting to order local police to fully cooperate on all immigration-related matters. This was a huge part of what prompted the city to sue Trump last month—a federal judge pushed back on some of his attempts to control the police, but did allow his deputies to make some requests on immigration issues.

Federal agents have also done plenty of enforcement on their own. They’ve led a series of high-profile raids and frequently arrest delivery drivers or other service workers in highly visible downtown neighborhoods.

Agents often wear masks, driven unmarked cars, or otherwise refused to identify themselves while making these arrests, which has particularly alarmed Mayor Muriel Bowser. She’s repeatedly urged the White House to restrain these tactics, to no avail.

“What we know is not working is a break in trust between police and community, especially with new federal partners in our community,” Bowser said. “We know having masked ICE agents in the community has not worked.”

She has also said she is “devastated by people living in fear” as a result of these immigration actions and accused ICE of “terrorizing communities.” But Bowser has stopped short of pressing Trump to remove immigration authorities from the city entirely, preferring to call for comprehensive immigration reform to address the root cause of these tensions.

This has been in keeping with her more cautious approach toward the administration, in general, as she seeks to ward off further incursions on the District’s autonomy. But this frustrated many advocates and some lawmakers, who would prefer a more assertive response to clearly demonstrate that the city is not welcoming these immigration agents: particularly as Trump weighs similar interventions elsewhere.

“We do not want people to be taken from our community because of their immigration status, because of their housing status, because of the color of their skin, because of their age,” said Ward 1 Councilmember Brianne Nadeau at a rally in Mount Pleasant, which has become the target of immigration authorities due to its large Latino population. “All of the folks being targeted in our community right now by the federal government are our neighbors. And I will do everything I can to support them.”

Virginia

Once someone is detained by immigration authorities in Virginia or D.C., they are typically taken to the agency’s Washington Field Office, in Chantilly, Va., for processing, before they’re sent to detention facilities elsewhere in the country, according to a statement from a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official to WAMU. The office is one of the agency’s many holding facilities, designed for short stays of around 12 hours.

But local activists say the office has been swamped by heightened enforcement in D.C., which the ACLU of Virginia says is resulting in “overcrowded and dangerous conditions.” In a letter to ICE officials on Thursday, the legal group said it had gathered accounts of “hundreds of people have been held for days in overcrowded rooms, without beds, sufficient food, medications or medical care, hygiene products, access to showers, or the ability to communicate confidentially with attorneys.”

“You cannot create a black site in Chantilly, Virginia, where people are unable to have access or know their rights, have access to counsel, are held in conditions where it’s unsafe, and they can’t tell anybody about it,” said Sophia Gregg, Senior Immigrants’ Rights attorney at the ACLU of Virginia.

Gregg also said people held at the Chantilly office also have limited access to phone calls, and no ability to speak to their lawyers confidentially, even as ICE officials have pressured people to sign deportation orders.

Amy Fischer, Amnesty International USA’s Director of Refugee and Migrant Rights, said she had also personally spoken to about a dozen families and former detainees. One major problem, she said, is that people held at Chantilly do not appear in the ICE detainee locator system, meaning their families often go days without knowing where they are.

“We’re seeing agents in unmarked vehicles, wearing face masks, taking people off the streets without a warrant, without probable cause. And then they’re truly being disappeared,” Fischer said. “Families [are] saying, ‘My loved one went to work and they never came home and we have no idea where they are.’”

In a statement, a senior DHS official dismissed the reports of overcrowded conditions and access to phones.

“The Chantilly field office is at 32 percent capacity—nowhere near maximum capacity,” the statement said. “Detainees are receiving three meals a day, have access to phones, showers, legal representation, blankets, and medical care.”

The official also wrote that those being processed at the office “include Tren de Aragua gang members, child rapists, drug dealers and those convicted of violent assault.”

“When will the media stop covering sob stories of illegal alien processing and detention centers and start focusing on the victims of illegal alien crime?” the statement concluded.

Fischer and Gregg said those claims do not square with accounts from the people they have spoken with. Many of the detainees held at Chantilly, Gregg said, are people who have been pulled over in traffic stops or other enforcement actions in D.C.

Fischer acknowledged the number of people held at Chantilly at any given time fluctuates, as ICE detains people in D.C. and buses detainees out to other detention facilities, usually at night.

Amnesty and a coalition of local advocacy groups in Virginia and the D.C. region sent their own letter about conditions at the Washington Field Office to the state’s congressional delegation, urging them to intervene.

About 100 people gathered on Wednesday evening to protest near the office. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner told the press on Thursday he was working to schedule an oversight visit.

The conditions at the field office, Gregg argues, are likely a violation of detainees’ first and fifth amendment rights, and their rights under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The ACLU put forward a list of remedies in their letter to ICE, including limiting the processing time at Chantilly to 12 hours, providing adequate meals, giving lawyers access to clients held there, offering language interpretation, and putting a medical professional on site.

With the crackdown in D.C. continuing and potentially widening as ICE receives a major infusion of new funding, Gregg said the ACLU would continue monitoring the situation at the field office. She did not rule out legal action if reports of poor conditions there continue.

“We’re committed to using every tool in our toolbox to fight back,” she said.

Maryland

Maryland residents in immigrant communities are currently experiencing a climate of fear and confusion regarding ICE enforcement activities. There’s also widespread uncertainty, with reports circulating on social media platforms, many of which are difficult to verify.

This atmosphere of anxiety has been further amplified by the crackdown residents are witnessing in neighboring Washington, D.C. And many grassroots organizations have moved their advocacy work offline into private channels for safety reasons, which is likely adding to the lack of verified reports on immigration arrests and detentions.

In addition, there appears to be a disconnect between community advocates for immigrant communities and county officials. Rocio Treminio Lopez, mayor of Brentwood in Prince George’s County, says she has been receiving daily reports from residents about incidents involving ICE. These include accounts of people being detained while performing routine activities like lawn maintenance, reports of ICE agents stationed outside homes waiting for residents to emerge, and allegations individuals are being targeted based solely on their Latino appearance. The mayor says she has been working to document these incidents and connect affected families with legal assistance.

“I don’t hear elected leaders talking about this publicly,’ said Treminio Lopez. “I don’t know if it’s the case that they don’t care because they are not voters. You care about your voters, right? But in my case, I really care about my community.”

It’s especially challenging because when county leaders attempt to verify these reports with the local police department, they often cannot confirm what community members are describing.

For example, someone may witness a routine local police stop and assume it’s ICE.

“I think because of the hysteria that the Trump administration has brought to our region people believe sometimes what they’re seeing is something that maybe it’s not,” said Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy in an interview with WAMU.

This discrepancy has created a situation where some community advocates and residents feel unsupported by elected officials. And local officials maintain they’re not seeing the level of enforcement activity residents are reporting.

Looking ahead, ICE is set to receive a substantial funding boost beginning in October, with Congress allocating $75 billion over four years. This raises questions about whether Montgomery and Prince George’s counties are adequately prepared for an expected escalation in immigration enforcement activities. And it means residents will likely continue to rely on community organizations that are already operating at capacity and struggling with limited resources.

Currently, there doesn’t appear to be any coordinated plan in either county for handling a significant escalation in ICE enforcement. Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich recently noted in an interview with Montgomery County Media that the increase in enforcement will hit the county’s economy hard and will be very destabilizing. But as far as what the county can do, his office told WAMU there are legal limitations around what the county can do when federal immigration enforcement occurs.

According to the post on X, the Immigration and Custom Enforcement operation will “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois.”

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson says the city has not received any formal notice of increased immigration enforcement under the Trump Administration.

In a statement he said, “We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees. ICE sent a 4-year-old boy with stage 4 kidney cancer to Honduras, even though the child was an American citizen. There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents. Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.”

The announcement follows a 24-hour wave of ICE sightings. In response, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, rapid response teams, elected leaders, and community groups rallied together in the Archer Heights neighborhood Monday to stand together in solidarity and resistance.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity near the George Eastman Museum early Tuesday was met with vocal opposition from activists and community leaders as roofers targeted by officers remained in a standoff.

Officers first stationed near Westminster Road and East Avenue, arresting one person who was completing work on a roof. Two other workers remained on the roof as a crowd of activists, attorneys, clergy, and community members gathered until 11 a.m. to protest the unfolding event.

“There’s two guys on the roof right now that are day workers,” said bystander Patrick Tobin. “I showed up, there (were) other workers here, and they took one guy who had a permit, he’s been working here for 25 years, he’s got a baby on the way, (and) never had any legal issues whatsoever.”

“There are a lot of people here who care very deeply about what’s happening in our country, and people are just not going to tolerate this,” said Monroe County Legislator Rachel Barnhart, who was in the crowd. “It just so happened that people were able to respond quickly to get here and to make it known that this is not acceptable in our communities.”

Organizations like Metro Justice and the Graduate Labor Union at the University of Rochester had notified the public of ongoing activity, alongside members from Spiritus Christi Church and First Unitarian Church. More than 200 people showed up in unified opposition to the ICE raid. Speakers with bullhorns provided words of support to those on the roof in Spanish, while attorneys sought to assist them in any way they could.

“Within an hour, several hundred people, including lawmakers and clergy, showed up to witness and protect our neighbors,” said Michi Wenderlich, Metro Justice campaign and policy coordinator, in a statement. “Rochester shows up to protect each other, and I’m proud of our community.”

With their vehicle tires slashed and a growing crowd surrounding officers and vehicles, ICE agents left the area without arresting those remaining on the roof. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

In a Sept. 2 letter, lawyers representing FEMA staff argue DHS’s actions amount to “illegal retaliatory personnel actions”. The letter is addressed to congressional committees, the Office of Special Counsel and the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“We ask you to open an investigation, if not already done, and, once completed, find that DHS has illegally retaliated against the FEMA whistleblowers and order immediate corrective action,” the letter states. “That action should include, but is not limited to, full reinstatement.”

More than 190 current and former FEMA employees signed the dissent letter, called the “Katrina Declaration,” in late August. It warns that changes at FEMA under the Trump administration, including personnel cuts, risk leaving the agency unprepared to deal with a major disaster.

While many employees signed anonymously, about three dozen current FEMA staff members signed the declaration with their names. FEMA placed those employees on administrative leave last week.

Abby McIlraith, an emergency management specialist at FEMA, was among those who publicly signed the letter and was then placed on administrative leave. She said those who were placed on leave want to get back to work as soon as possible, especially amid Atlantic hurricane season.

“We hope that they’ll respond, ideally be reinstating us immediately,” McIlraith told Federal News work. “But if they don’t, we’re prepared to keep fighting to return to work as soon as possible.”

DHS has come out strongly against the letter. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a statement released late last month, said the signers are “the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.”

McIlraith, who has been with FEMA less than a year, said she and her colleagues want to improve outcomes for disaster survivors.

“I personally was three years old when Hurricane Katrina made landfall, so it’s not like I’ve been presiding over decades of government inefficiency,” she said.

The whistleblower complaint, released by the Government Accountability Project, argues that the FEMA dissent letter contains “multiple protected disclosures.” Placing the employees on administrative leave, the letter argues, violated whistleblower retaliation laws.

Michael Fallings, managing partner at the law firm Tully Rinckey, said federal employees have the right to make protected disclosures, but agencies can argue that such disclosures are mere disagreements over policy.

“It’s not necessarily enough to say that FEMA was violating the law, but it is important to note that the employee just has to have a reasonable belief that the agency was violating the law,” Fallings said. “But that does take an analysis of the law being pointed to and the actions taken by the agency.”

The Office of Special Counsel can review such claims to determine whether there’s enough evidence to show that a prohibited personnel practice, such as whistleblower retaliation, occurred. OSC can then choose to move forward by mediating the case or even filing a legal request for a stay before the Merit System Protections Board.

“The Office Special Counsel does have many, many complaints that it has received since the new administration, so the speed in which they conduct investigation has been slower, but given that this has received national news, that’s probably something they’ll focus on trying to complete,” Fallings said.

Employees can also go directly to the MSPB with whistleblower complaints if OSC decides not to pick up the case or takes more than 120 days to make a decision.

Kevin Owen, a partner at Gilbert Employment Law, often represents federal employees in whistleblower cases brought to OSC and the MSPB.

Owen said he typically tries to assess a client’s motivation and whether they have evidence to back up their claims.

“Once we get that, that’s when you can start telling that this is something that has traction,” Owen said. “The one thing that usually leads me to believe that my clients have a compelling whistleblower disclosure is when management immediately puts them all on admin leave, because if it was frivolous, they would ignore it, or they would go through some sort of administrative disciplinary process that would be appropriate to handle those sorts of issues. Handling it this way leads me to think there’s smoke and fire.”

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has fired some employees for signing a dissent letter earlier this summer. Other EPA employees have been suspended for two weeks without pay.

An EPA spokesperson said the letter “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business.”

“The Environmental Protection Agency has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” the spokesperson said.

But Owen said protected disclosures can be made public, so long as the information contained within them is not prohibited by law from being released.

“If there’s a statute that says you can’t share this information, then releasing it publicly is problematic,” Owen said. “Absent that, then it is a protected disclosure.”

McIlraith said she has been alarmed by the firings of the EPA signers, but does not regret signing the Katrina Declaration. “I stand by everything in the letter,” she added.

Blasting so-called sanctuary laws in Chicago and Illinois, the latest effort targets people without legal permission to live in the U.S. who have criminal records. Like other Trump administration plans, it was stamped with a splashy name, “Operation Midway Blitz,” and circulated on social media with the mugshots of 11 foreign-born men it said should be deported.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor (JB) Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” said a statement from DHS.

Pritzker, who has been locked in a back-and-forth with Trump for days, criticized the move. He and Mayor Brandon Johnson have defended the state and city’s extensive sanctuary laws which bar coordination between local police and immigration agents. They’ve accused the Trump administration of using scare tactics, particularly with Latino residents in the nation’s third-largest city.

“Once again, this isn’t about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination — yet we’ve experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump administration’s focused on scaring Illinoisians.”

Chicago has been bracing for an influx of immigration agents and possibly the National Guard for two weeks. Numerous protests have cropped up downtown, outside a suburban military base DHS plans to use and at an immigration processing center that’s expected to be a hub of activity.

Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. For the federal intervention in Los Angeles, a judge deemed the National Guard deployment illegal, but the Trump administration got a victory related to immigration enforcement there when the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a restraining order barring agents there from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, rejected the latest operation announced in Chicago.

“These actions don’t make us safer,” he said in a statement. “They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction.”

It remained unclear what role Monday’s announced program would play in a Chicago surge.

Adding to the confusion was a handful of immigration arrests over the weekend in Chicago, which galvanized the city’s vocal activist network and worries that it was the start of something bigger.

“This is about terrorizing our communities,” said Chicago City Council member Jeylú Gutiérrez said. “But we will not be intimidated.”

She and immigrant rights activists said that five people arrested were “beloved community members.” Some were on their way to work when arrested Sunday. Another works as a flower vendor.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed four arrests but gave sparse information, noting criminal histories with previous arrests and one conviction for driving under the influence.

“ICE has always operated in Chicago,” the agency said in a statement. “We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners.”

DHS said the operation announced Monday would be in honor of Katie Abraham, one of two Illinois women killed in a January fatal car crash. A grand jury indicted a 29-year-old man in the hit-and-run. The Guatemalan national also faces federal false identification crimes.

On March 22, the Department of State paid El Salvador the money agreed, while legal challenges around the deportations were continuing in U.S. courts.

Under the agreement, El Salvador was paid $4.76 million to house 300 immigrants accused of being part of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) at its CECOT high-security prison, as long as certain conditions were met, including not assisting asylum seekers.

The document was released by Democracy Forward, one of the groups suing the U.S. Department of State, alongside Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, for the use of the AEA to speedily deport alleged illegal immigrants earlier this year.

Newsweek reached out to the U.S. Department of State and Homeland Security, and El Salvador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment via contact form and email on Tuesday.

Why It Matters

The Trump administration's use of the AEA to quickly deport alleged TdA members was challenged in court in March, with plaintiffs arguing that immigrants were being denied their right to due process – or a full court hearing – before being removed from the U.S. The use of El Salvador's CECOT prison was denounced by human rights groups and Democrats in Congress for its reputation as a place where prisoners were tortured and never released.

What To Know

Democracy Forward and RFK Human Rights said they secured the release of the agreement following efforts by the federal government to keep it out of public view.

The document, from the Ministry of Foreign Relations in El Salvador, showed that initially the deportees would be held for up to a year at CECOT, unless another decision was made on their detention.

Under the $4.76 million agreement, El Salvador had to agree to only use the funds for the holding of the alleged gang members, and not to give any of it to a third party. It specifically stated that money should not make its way into the hands of those linked to criminal activities.

The document, dated March 22, 2025, said the agreement had been reached on March 14, the day before two flights carrying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees left the U.S. for El Salvador, despite a court hearing being underway at the time which resulted in a ruling seeking to halt the flights.

Among those on board was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man the administration later admitted had been deported because of an administrative error, and several Venezuelan nationals who had not had their day in immigration court.

On March 22, the Department of State paid El Salvador the money agreed, while legal challenges around the deportations were continuing in U.S. courts.

The White House insisted that those who were sent to CECOT were known gang members and violent criminals, and insisted that the U.S. did not have the power to bring them back.

Later, under an agreement between the U.S., El Salvador, and Venezuela, the U.S. deportees held at the prison were released back to Venezuela.

What People Are Saying

Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a press release: ""While the American people should not be required to go to court to secure this information, we are pleased that our litigation led to this important information being released.

""The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses. The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.""

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, in a post on X in February: ""We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee. The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.""

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled 6-3 to stay a temporary restraining order that had prohibited federal agents from stopping people in Los Angeles County based on their apparent race or ethnicity, their speaking Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence in a particular location such as a car wash, bus stop or day laborer pickup site.

The decision sets a temporary precedent as the case proceeds in federal district court as scheduled for Sept. 24. Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law attorney and retired professor at Cornell Law School, said a final decision is not likely until June 2026 at the earliest. “That’s a long time for mayors to have to deal with this issue in the meantime,” he said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the ruling, saying the result is that “the White House and masked federal agents can racially profile Angelenos with no due process, snatch them off the street with no evidence or warrant, and take them away with no explanation. This decision will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect — not persecute — our people.”

Dive Insight:

Los Angeles County, Los Angeles city and seven other cities within the county on July 2 filed a motion to intervene in a federal class action lawsuit alleging federal agents were engaging in “unconstitutional and unlawful immigration raids by targeting Angelenos based on their perceived race and ethnicity and also denying detainees constitutionally mandated due process.”

On July 11, a federal judge in Los Angeles issued a temporary restraining order that barred federal immigration agents from stopping suspected undocumented immigrants based on those factors. The Trump administration in August asked the Supreme Court for an immediate administrative stay on the order, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer stating those factors “can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.”

Noting that about 10% of people in the Los Angeles region, or about 2 million people, are estimated to be in the United States illegally, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in granting the stay that immigration stops “based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence have been an important component of U.S. Immigration enforcement for decades.”

While Kavanaugh said “apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” it can be considered “a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the Fourth Amendment prohibits seizing individuals based on the factors, which “in no way reflect the kind of individualized inquiry the Fourth Amendment demands.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote.

The big picture: But DHS guidance on sensitive spaces updated in January to greenlight arrests in schools and churches has contributed to a culture of concern in America's classrooms and school communities.

Driving the news: The DHS chided news stories about children and families being fearful about returning to school under President Trump's immigration crackdown, saying, ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does NOT raid or target schools.""

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release ICE would not go into schools to arrest children and that officers would require secondary supervisor approval before taking action in a school, a scenario the memo said would likely be ""extremely rare.""

She said ""criminals"" will ""no longer be able to hide in America's schools to avoid arrest.

""The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.""

Flashback: In an interview with ABC's Martha Raddatz shortly after DHS removed prior guidance to avoid so-called sensitive areas, border czar Tom Homan was asked what criminals would be hiding in schools. He replied, ""How many MS-13 members are the age 14 to 17? Many of them.""

He continued, ""If it's a national security threat, public safety threat and ... what you need to understand is that it's case by case, name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus.""

The White House told NBC News in January that the policy change was not a directive to go into schools.

State of play: But many school districts, boards and administrators, faced with an information bedlam, rushed earlier this year to spell out their policies on interacting with immigration enforcement.

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, schools can't share information about students without parent permission, Axios' Jessica Boehm reports. The law applies to law enforcement unless an officer has secured a judge's order granting them access to the information.

The bottom line: Even if ICE activity on campus is rare, families and school-aged children have been affected by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

According to the American Immigration Council, more than 5 million U.S. citizen children have at least one undocumented family member.

And research suggests immigration sweeps can contribute to student absenteeism and disrupt classroom life, even when there are no boots on school grounds.

Lander was engaged in the process of immigrant accompaniment, which is when humanitarian supporters accompany immigrants to their court proceedings. Their presence can throw sand in the system’s gears and slow down deportations. Donald Trump’s second administration is criminalizing this practice precisely because they know it works.

In researching my book The Politics of Sanctuary, I spent years during Trump’s first term observing activists who practice immigrant accompaniment, trying to understand its mechanics and effectiveness. “We can stop or slow down the deportation process,” said one volunteer with the New Sanctuary Coalition (NSC), an organization dedicated to assisting migrants and asylum seekers. The Trump administration has moved to punish nonprofits and faith-based groups that engage in sanctuary practices like accompaniment, alleging that they promote and facilitate immigration law violations.

“The judges know us, ICE knows us. They fear us,” the NSC volunteer continued. “They have blocked us [from accompaniments], but we will keep going. We show up to doctors’ appointments, to family court, to lawyers’ appointments, [and] to Varick Street,” where New York City’s immigration court is located.

The volunteer was not bluffing about the effectiveness of the accompaniment strategy. I observed numerous cases where NSC volunteers accompanying immigrants slowed down the deportation process. The volunteers I observed were mostly native-born, white, female New Yorkers, ranging from middle-aged to senior citizens. Their presence was critical for the success of migrants’ cases. At times they were a silent presence at ICE check-ins and case hearings, while at other times they were vocal in their advocacy. “We are literally standing at that line and making sure that we hold that line and enforce rights,” one volunteer told me.

During Trump’s first term, migrant advocates sought to counter the administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric with evidence that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans. These efforts did not completely reverse public opinion, which carried Trump to a second victory on an even more anti-immigrant platform in 2024. However, activism during the first Trump term did bring citizens and noncitizens together at demonstrations and protests, strengthening the movement for migrant rights. Many citizens developed political consciousness during this period and dedicated themselves to sanctuary practices like accompaniment — practices that continue to this day, often led by faith-based organizations.

These citizen activists didn’t just sympathize with immigrants but felt they had a duty to defend them. This sense of responsibility led many to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan to support migrants attending ICE appointments. Living near immigrant neighborhoods, having immigrant friends, and believing that New York City’s institutions could be pushed to protect migrants all contributed to their support. The immigrants involved in these networks, meanwhile, saw themselves not as criminals but as tentative residents whose rights were being violated — a perspective that grew stronger through their participation in sanctuary practices. Their own activism challenged the idea that migrants are simply victims of an exploitative economic system.

Cities as Battlegrounds for Citizenship

Sanctuary practices in cities create space for undocumented people, asylum seekers, and refugees to engage in political struggle. But they can’t do it alone: their effectiveness depends on building alliances with citizens and permanent residents who join these struggles with practices like accompaniment and acts of civil disobedience. It is precisely this solidarity that the Trump administration is seeking to criminalize.

Nor can migrants claim rights without the dedicated assistance of sympathetic political leaders. Many of them lack the right to vote; the New York Court of Appeals ruled six to one in March 2025 that the state constitution requires citizenship for voting. Systematically barred from the formal representational political process, they must rely instead on voluntary action from political figures — actions like Lander’s arrest as a mayoral candidate during an accompaniment action.

Trump has made outright threats to defund sanctuary cities (though only small percentages of budgets would actually be affected). He has also threatened to expand the criminalization of immigrants, which city administrations have resisted by refusing police cooperation with ICE. These words have turned into violent acts against protesters and political representatives seen as obstructing ICE enforcement.

Trump’s threats against grassroots sanctuary efforts serve to heighten racial hostilities, scapegoat immigrants, manufacture emergencies, and instill fear in immigrants to keep them from using social and health services. Meanwhile, urban disinvestment and austerity programs are creating a false sense of scarcity for which immigrants are held responsible. Amid urban inequality, blaming immigrants can mask the lack of real solutions for urban problems like affordable housing, high-functioning social services, accessible transit, and so on.

Trump’s executive orders earlier this year intensified threats to sanctuary jurisdictions by calling to cut federal funding, penalize the granting of public benefits, and target local officials for prosecution. Federal courts largely blocked these measures as unconstitutional, and cities continue to fight the policy in court. They must continue to put up a fight, as sanctuary practices represent an essential part of the struggle for migrant rights and indeed all human rights.

The sanctuary movement offers migrants more than simply hope that they won’t be deported. It provides concrete assistance toward the goal of avoiding deportation. Of course, getting migrants to participate in sanctuary practices becomes difficult in a climate of heightened fear amid stepped-up deportations. This makes the participation of native-born activists all the more necessary to create conditions of safety and solidarity. Only when migrants and nonmigrants stand together can they thwart Trump’s anti-migrant agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09104051/GettyImages-2221177518-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:58:18.208256

Later that month, about 18 people from Berger’s West Berkeley neighborhood met in her home for a know-your-rights workshop.
Following a recommendation from the task force, the Berkeley City Council is expected to consider an ordinance Tuesday night that would codify city sanctuary protections into law.","Ellen Moore, a social worker at Oakland’s La Clinica de la Raza, has been distributing red “know-your-rights” cards to immigrants in the East Bay since the start of President Trump’s first term in 2016. But what’s occurred in recent months, she said, calls for something greater.

“Both Trump administrations, but particularly this administration, have been so cruel and targeted immigrants in such an inhumane and aggressive way that I can’t help but see how this is affecting our community, my friends, neighbors, and co-workers,” said Moore, who lives in Berkeley. “It made me realize that I need to do more.”

Nine months into President Donald Trump’s second term, concerned Berkeley residents like Moore have been stepping up to meet the increasing demand for advocacy and support for migrant residents. Heightened threats of deportation and reduced access for immigrants to public health and safety net programs have led to the formation of neighborhood groups, frequent street protests, and calls for stronger sanctuary protections.

California, which is home to about 2 million undocumented immigrants, has borne the brunt of the Trump administration’s crackdown in the last several months, along with other states with large immigrant populations such as Texas and Florida. Communities in Los Angeles have experienced ICE raids at workplaces in which people were tackled to the ground and detained by masked federal agents. Similar enforcement tactics haven’t been seen in the Bay Area to the same extent. But the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted migrants at courthouses in San Francisco and Concord, arresting dozens. In early August, Berkeley was among 18 “sanctuary jurisdictions” — a group of cities that also included Oakland, Emeryville, Richmond, El Cerrito and Albany — targeted by the Trump administration for not doing enough to enforce federal immigration laws.

Monica Marini became involved with Berkeley’s La Peña Cultural Center when it was founded in the 1970s as a gathering place for Chileans who fled their country following a military coup. She’d immigrated to the U.S. from Argentina and became involved in advocacy from the start. She has lived in Berkeley for more than 50 years.

Now 84, she continues to advocate for the immigrant community through La Peña. She attends know-your-rights workshops and “court watch,” a training that teaches people to observe and document due process violations in court and bring transparency and accountability to legal immigration procedures. She attended the Concord Immigration Court several times this year as an observer.

“I am an immigrant too,” she said. “I wanted to go and see what happens there. I have the idea that I would protect them. If ICE is present, I will have to do something.”

Berkeley residents adopt East Bay day labor work sites

Maryann O’Sullivan, 72, has lived in Berkeley for nearly a decade. A retired lawyer, she’s continued to work as a volunteer for progressive causes in the East Bay.

She joined the grassroots group Indivisible East Bay after attending one of the organization’s monthly meetings with a friend at a Berkeley park. Soon after, O’Sullivan began volunteering as a “peacekeeper,” or safety monitor, at local protests and demonstrations.

She also joined Indivisible’s rapid response team, which led to her involvement with the “adopt a corner” campaign, a project of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network (NDLON), where volunteers work two-hour shifts keeping a lookout for ICE at locations where day laborers routinely gather in the morning to pick up jobs. In the event of a raid or other enforcement activity, they are there to act as observers, record video, and collect information such as officer badge numbers. They can also serve as mediators to connect families with missing people and legal aid if raids occur. O’Sullivan has mostly volunteered at sites in Oakland.

“You think, ‘Why are they out there? They look like sitting ducks.’ And then you realize that they have to work for themselves and their families,” she said.

O’Sullivan said NDLON and Indivisible provided training to her and other campaign volunteers, which included education on the potential risks of joining these actions, such as being arrested themselves. Before retirement, when she had her law license, O’Sullivan was more cautious with her activism. But things are different now, she said.

“I don’t want to go to jail, but I also feel like what’s happening now is so beyond anything I ever expected,” O’Sullivan said. “If standing up for what I think is right requires that I get arrested now, then I’m willing to take that risk.”

Neighbors organize ‘know-your-rights’ workshops and trainings

Moore said she started becoming interested in human rights as an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley in the late ‘70s. Around the same time, she learned about La Peña Cultural Center, where she now volunteers as a member of the Old Guard, a group of longtime advocates. This year, she and other members formed the Friends of La Peña Immigrants’ Rights Group to build community and a support network among immigrants and allies.

The trainings and workshops they help organize at the center are facilitated by local lawyers and community advocates, who teach volunteers about their constitutional rights (particularly the Fourth and Fifth amendments, which protect against illegal searches and guarantee due process) and how to assert them in public settings when confronted with law enforcement.

Community members who volunteer to observe cases and hearings in immigration courts are taught what to look for and document. They cannot interfere with work conducted by ICE, but they can be a resource to connect people with legal representation.

“Our role as court observers is very different than the role of somebody in the street protesting,” Moore said. “We have to observe the rules of the court. We are there to support immigrants who are applying for legal status, to make sure that their rights are not violated and that they’re not illegally detained in the courtroom without due process.”

This type of advocacy takes significant time out of the day, Moore said, making it difficult for people with full-time jobs to become involved. As such, many volunteers are older. Some have experience working in social justice; they might come from a religious background; or “they just care about human rights, want to be in solidarity with newcomers, and want to hold our country accountable,” she said.

Activist Amanda Berger jokingly calls it the “geriatric resistance movement.” She said many retired people in Berkeley, like herself, are interested in social justice.

Berger, who moved to Berkeley in 2001 from New York City, has long been involved with progressive and philanthropic organizations, working in literacy and re-entry support programs in California prisons, and canvassing to increase voter turnout.

As an active member of Bay Resistance, a grass-roots social justice organization, she recently became part of a Berkeley neighborhood “pod” where members communicate over secure group chats and participate in local actions each month. Berger has joined protests against the reopening of a federal women’s correctional facility in Dublin, which the Trump administration has floated turning into an immigration detention center.

“When Trump was elected, I started feeling a lot of urgency around immigration issues,” she said.

In January, Berger’s neighbor across the street sent out a group text checking in on people in the neighborhood. Anxious feelings were soon channeled into organizing.

Later that month, about 18 people from Berger’s West Berkeley neighborhood met in her home for a know-your-rights workshop. At a subsequent meeting, about 35 people attended. The growing collection of volunteers created a WhatsApp group to remain in touch and report on any incidents.

Berger said her neighbors — who include people on visas, mixed-status households, and immigrant students — were “super freaked out” following the inauguration. But she thinks the neighborhood has become more organized since the reelection.

“Should something happen, like Trump takes the National Guard to Oakland or there’s an ICE raid in the neighborhood, I feel like we have 65 people who I know will be responsive,” she said.

Meanwhile, city of Berkeley officials are also preparing for the Trump administration to escalate attacks on local immigrant communities, and pulling in grassroots groups. Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii reaffirmed Berkeley as a sanctuary city in January, reconvening a sanctuary task force with representatives from a variety of local immigration, faith, legal, and education stakeholders, including La Peña, Oasis Legal Services, Berkeley Unified School District and Berkeley City College.

Following a recommendation from the task force, the Berkeley City Council is expected to consider an ordinance Tuesday night that would codify city sanctuary protections into law. This would prohibit city workers from disclosing personal information to immigration enforcement and create new procedures to report collaborations with these federal agencies, according to the proposed ordinance.

“I am outraged and I am disturbed to see the country that I grew up in and believed in, throw due process out the window,” Moore said. But helping local communities prepare, she said, can provide an important counterbalance to the anxiety and fear caused by waiting and wondering what federal authorities may do next.

“It’s important for us to have a gathering place to learn together and to be trained together,” Moore said. “These things can make us feel hopeless, but we cannot afford to be hopeless.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250327-200402.webp?fit=1600%2C1200&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-09 11:57:47.436995

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a 6-3 decision on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the rulings of two lower courts in Vazquez Perdomo v. Noem, allowing federal immigration agencies to continue using enforcement practices that critics call unconstitutional and racially discriminatory.

The ruling followed protests in Los Angeles earlier this year against the Trump administration’s mass deportation program led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A press release from the ACLU of Southern California detailed the decision’s impact on immigrant communities and their support networks.

The lawsuit, brought by workers, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security unlawfully arrested and detained people to meet deportation quotas. Plaintiffs said agents targeted individuals “solely on four factors… including apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or English with an accent; presence in a particular location like a bus stop, car wash, or agricultural site; or the type of work a person does.”

Pedro Vazquez Perdomo, the lead plaintiff, said, “When ICE grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why. I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

Teresa Romero, president of UFW, called the decision dangerous. “Today’s SCOTUS ruling puts farm workers — and every Californian who looks or sounds like they might be an immigrant — in great danger. This does not impact immigrants in a vacuum, it will affect all of us,” she said. “We will continue to seek a preliminary injunction in this case, and we will keep fighting.”

Alvaro M. Huerta of Immigrant Defenders Law Center said, “Sadly, today’s decision effectively greenlights racial profiling while the case plays out in the lower courts.”

Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel added, “Today’s decision gives license to the Trump administration to resume racially discriminatory raids across Los Angeles, detaining people without evidence or due process simply because of the color of their skin, the language they speak, or the work they do.”

Armando Gudino, executive director of the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, called it a constitutional setback. “The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of racial profiling. A dark shadow had been cast over this country’s Constitution and its future,” he said. “The decision legitimizes the unconstitutional practice of targeting individuals based on their race, language or neighborhood.”

Annie Lai, director of the Immigrant and Racial Justice Solidarity Clinic at UC Irvine School of Law, said the ruling undermined the Fourth Amendment but praised her clients’ resilience. “Our clients have faced the government with incredible bravery and will continue to do so. We will be right alongside them,” she said.

Chandra Bhatnagar of the ACLU Foundation of Southern California compared the government’s tactics to other forms of targeted discrimination. He said the raids were “another physical manifestation of the Trump administration’s attempt to treat people as second-class citizens due to who they are, what they look like, and who they love.”

Despite the ruling, immigrant rights leaders expressed determination to keep fighting. Angelica Salas, executive director of CHIRLA, said, “The administration’s war on immigrants is going to fail. Very soon, we’ll be back in court continuing to fight against these obviously illegal policies. We will continue to watch, document, and protest peacefully what we see is lawless, mass roundups and a federal policy of cruelty and detention.”

Huerta echoed that sentiment, saying, “Despite the Supreme Court’s disheartening decision to greenlight ICE’s unlawful terror tactics, our commitment to Southern California’s immigrant communities is unwavering.”

Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, emphasized community action. “Angelenos are not waiting to be saved by courts or politicians. Only the people will protect the people. Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo,” he said.

Federal courts largely blocked these measures as unconstitutional, and cities continue to fight the policy in court. They must continue to put up a fight, as sanctuary practices represent an essential part of the struggle for migrant rights and indeed all human rights.

The sanctuary movement offers migrants more than simply hope that they won’t be deported. It provides concrete assistance toward the goal of avoiding deportation. Of course, getting migrants to participate in sanctuary practices becomes difficult in a climate of heightened fear amid stepped-up deportations. This makes the participation of native-born activists all the more necessary to create conditions of safety and solidarity. Only when migrants and nonmigrants stand together can they thwart Trump’s anti-migrant agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09104051/GettyImages-2221177518-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 11:57:51.897648

For the Chicago Police Department, the challenge is acute. The force must preserve public safety in a city already under strain while avoiding the appearance of working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities, a stance that could erode community trust and ignite new protests.

The same balancing act has confronted other big-city departments in recent months. Local police in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., were drawn into fraught arrangements with federal agencies that experts say left residents wary and, at times, undermined public confidence in their police.

Now, Chicago finds itself on the same path, with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker objecting to any National Guard deployment and city officials bracing for how the added federal presence could reshape the dynamic on the ground. The outcome, policing experts warn, may determine whether Chicago police can maintain credibility in immigrant communities likely to be targeted by a president determined to show force.

“What the Trump administration is doing here is engaging in federal policing in a way that really rips at the seams of the relationships between state and local police and the federal government, between communities and law enforcement,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council. “Those kinds of standoffs and contentious practices is what erodes public safety.”

Sanctuary City Conflicts

Over the course of the Trump administration’s immigration surges, Chicago officials repeatedly reaffirmed the city’s so-called sanctuary policies that have been place for four decades. But as fear grew about looming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, the city’s mayor has avoided detail about how local police will navigate tensions on the ground.

Chicago’s policies bar local law enforcement from asking about or detaining someone for their immigration status or from supporting ICE, including by securing perimeters for raids, transporting detainees or sharing information about undocumented immigrants.

Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order last week declaring city police would not collaborate with federal immigration agents. It also requires Chicago officers to wear uniforms and not wear masks to “clearly distinguish them from federal agents.”

“We will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” Johnson said before signing the order.

Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said any cooperation between ICE and local officers hurts public trust and blurs the lines between agencies.

“It can get really messy,” Futterman said. “There’s how sanctuary cities are supposed to work on paper vs. what happens in practice.”

Caught Between Protesters and ICE Officials

Gupta said Chicago police will have to coordinate with federal agencies to some degree, even to respond to protests against immigration raids and detentions.

In the meantime, city officials say they’re following a similar strategy to policing as the one in place around the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which cost the city about $27 million in officer overtime.

ICE detained at least 10 Chicagoans at an immigration office on June 4, drawing dozens of protesters and local elected officials to the street outside. Police didn’t originally know it was an immigration action and left after realizing that, officials said.

Some protesters and local elected officials claimed they saw Chicago officers clearing the way for ICE agents and protecting their vehicles. Chicago City Council members demanded an internal probe into officers’ behavior.

Similar tensions played out in California, where hundreds of protesters clashed with federal immigration authorities in June, prompting Trump to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite the objections of local authorities.

Los Angeles police made hundreds of arrests and dispersed demonstrations, including at locations where ICE agents were conducting raids.

Sanctuary city policies “don’t mean a local police officer will stand in between an ICE officer and a non-citizen,” which would be considered an obstruction of justice, said Rose Cuison-Villazor, a professor at Rutgers University Law School.

But whether local officers step in if they disagree with federal agents’ interactions with protesters is also uncertain.

“Do they have the power to intervene?“ Futterman asked. ”These are really difficult legal questions. It’s a really fraught situation.”

Local Police, National Guard Interactions Not Clearly Defined

Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Washington D.C.-based think tank the Police Executive Research Forum, said local police leaders are used to working with federal authorities including joint task forces aimed at terrorism, drugs or organized crime. But if the National Guard is deployed in Chicago, its role in performing local policing hasn’t been clearly defined.

On Thursday, the District of Columbia sued to stop President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard during his law enforcement intervention there.

“As far as the National Guard as police, they have traditionally assisted in natural disasters, large scale disturbances and aiding law enforcement in support functions like traffic and crowd control,“ Wexler said. ”I don’t recall the National Guard being deployed to deal directly with day-to-day crime issues.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling has asked for more communication from federal authorities so “we don’t have people running scared and it doesn’t create chaos on our streets.”

In Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner says the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard is a threat to successful prosecutions of crime, risking witness statements being thrown out and evidence suppressed.

“None of these people are trained in evidence gathering procedures,“ Krasner said. ”None of them are trained in Miranda warnings. None of them are trained in Fourth Amendment rights and procedures and illegal searches and seizures.”

Kenneth Corey, a former department chief with the New York City Police Department, warned that surging resources like the National Guard leads to an artificial and often temporary reduction in crime.

“Any time you surge resources like that you are going to see an immediate reduction in crime because it has a deterrent effect,” said Corey, who now works at the University of Chicago Crime Lab’s Policing Leadership Academy.

“But the problem is it’s short-lived. It can’t be sustained. When they leave, crime returns. You haven’t addressed the root causes of crime.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-09 14:57:14.583359

The officer said he and other law enforcement intentionally took firefighters to a remote location for officer “safety,” according to meeting attendees.","New details are emerging about the events leading to the arrests of two firefighters by federal officers last month at a wildfire on the Olympic Peninsula.

In an interview with The Seattle Times, Tom Clemo, who was the leader of the fire response at the time of the arrests, said they stemmed from an investigation of alleged time-card fraud by private crews working the fire.

Clemo and seven other people interviewed for this story who had direct knowledge of the incident, as well as information garnered from videos, photos and a virtual meeting invite for a debrief on the action, shed light on what preceded the arrests, and those who were involved.

Clemo has sought to distance himself and his team from the arrests.

“My primary concern is the safety of firefighters,” he said last week, “not immigration status.”

The Aug. 27 incident on the Bear Gulch fire reverberated around the country as President Donald Trump’s administration ramps up immigration enforcement actions. Fifty members of Congress demanded answers about the arrests.

The firefighters are being detained at the Northwest Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center in Tacoma.

Clemo said his team’s finance staff discovered the alleged discrepancies between hours worked and hours submitted among several contract crews. His team reported them to the federal law enforcement officer assigned to the team, Clemo said. The officer’s position is to manage security on large fire responses.

A Department of the Interior spokesperson said on Monday the security manager on the fire at the time was a “uniformed ranger” with the Bureau of Land Management.

The spokesperson said fire response leadership asked the security manager to look into “potentially significant timecard fraud” on the part of two contract fire crews.

The agency said the BLM ranger found the two crews “had individuals working under visas,” and asked U.S. Border Patrol to verify visas.

Incident management teams are often made up of federal, state and local fire officials who have signed up to lead fire responses outside their day jobs, dispatching to fires across a region or the country.

When asked how the time-card investigation was related to the immigration-related arrests, Clemo said it was all in the hands of federal law enforcement.

The arrests did not follow a Biden-era Department of Homeland Security policy, which limits immigration enforcement where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided. Under the first Trump administration, a similar policy was in place during the Northern California wildfires.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment about its policy of enforcing immigration law at locations where disaster and emergency response is being provided.

The fire crews

Private fire crews play a critical role in the nation’s wildfire response.

The two contract crews that were questioned were Arden Solutions and Table Rock. They are 20-person crews.

The U.S. Forest Service has awarded agreements with more than 800 Type 2 private hand crews, like Table Rock, in 2025. These firefighters dig fire lines, clear brush and snuff out hot spots.

There are roughly 40 national Type 2 Initial Attack crews, like Arden Solutions, under contract with the Forest Service. They are considered to be the elite firefighters of the private industry, and can be called upon when a fire breaks out to be the first layer of defense.

The DHS claimed the two men arrested were not firefighters. Wildfire veterans have emphatically rejected the notion, with some noting that anyone dispatched to an active fire needs to have an Incident Qualification Card, commonly referred to as a red card, which certifies the person can complete firefighting duties.

About 75% of hand crew companies are based in the Pacific Northwest, according to the executive director of the National Wildfire Suppression Association, which represents 365 member companies in 29 states. The private industry also provides other resources, including medical units, heavy equipment, tree fallers, water handling and specialty equipment.

The industry relies on a strong immigrant workforce, firefighters say. In Oregon, forestry companies requested more than 3,000 H-2B visas for temporary foreign workers this fiscal year. Not all forestry companies fight wildfires, though some have transitioned to do so during the fire season.

These crews typically document their hours worked on paper sheets called a “Crew Time Report,” get them signed off by their division or task force leader and submit them to the finance section of the fire’s incident command every day. The finance team typically flags any issues or discrepancies for the team to correct.

Before leaving any fire, the finance team will review time cards for firefighters and make sure everything looks accurate — including identifying information, hours and equipment.

Time-card investigation

In a morning briefing days before the arrests, Scot Roeber, who was supervising one area of the fire, said he encouraged firefighters, which included Arden Solutions, to complete their time cards to reflect the terms in their contracts.

That’s not an uncommon request on fires. He said Arden was not singled out.

Arden updated their time cards that morning, according to a firefighter who requested not to be named for fear of retaliation.

Firefighters and other fire personnel say such discrepancies pop up, and they are almost always corrected on-site.

Clemo, the incident commander, said the crews as a whole, not individual firefighters, were being investigated.

Clemo said he requested the questioning related to time-card fraud allegations not be done at fire camp due to safety concerns, and law enforcement obliged.

He said he was told the firefighters would be questioned about the allegations at the remote location where federal agents met the crews. He said there was no mention of immigration enforcement.

Day of the arrests

The crews got to their assigned firefighting location for the day around 8:30 a.m. An hour later, federal officers pulled up.

Table Rock Crew Boss David Diaz said upon arriving federal officers stated the reason they were brought there was because of allegations of time-card fraud.

Diaz said a BLM officer told crew leaders that the officer had been watching the firefighters since they got on the fire, taking timestamps for their meal breaks, showers and time sleeping, and that he was reporting it to the finance team.

Federal law enforcement then lined up firefighters to check their IDs.

Some firefighters who were cleared after their IDs were checked stayed in line in solidarity with those who were waiting. They said law enforcement threatened to arrest those who wouldn’t get back in their trucks.

“You can either cooperate with us or we throw you in handcuffs and put you in the back of the vehicle,” an officer appears to say to firefighters in a video shared with The Seattle Times.

Clemo said it was only after the incident that he found out Border Patrol was there and the arrests had happened.

“I was lied to,” Diaz said. “I brought the crew out there to do an assignment that never happened.”

Before leaving the fire, Diaz said he was escorted by two officers to finance and his team’s time cards were corrected and resubmitted.

Crew members over several days had logged an extra half-hour for the time they were waiting for their bosses to finish up getting a morning briefing. Crew members often use that time to prepare lunches and gear before they head out. Diaz said only crew bosses can log time for the morning briefing.

Debrief

In a meeting later that day, held in person and on a video call, a BLM officer gave a synopsis of the operation, according to several attendees interviewed by The Seattle Times.

There was no elaboration, attendees say, on whether those engaged in the alleged fraud were found or if the time cards were corrected.

The officer said he and other law enforcement intentionally took firefighters to a remote location for officer “safety,” according to meeting attendees.

He said the operation needed Border Patrol agents to confirm work status, according to attendees. He said that operation resulted in two people being detained by Border Patrol.

According to one attendee, the officer’s report was upbeat until others in the meeting shared that a Seattle Times reporter had photos of the arrests.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09082025_tzr_tzr_174852.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-09-09 14:56:49.179433

The big picture: The launch of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" follows weeks of threats from President Trump to tackle crime in Chicago and other Democrat-run cities by expanding ICE's presence and possibly deploying National Guard troops as part of his agenda against undocumented immigrants despite opposition from Democratic leaders.

Despite Trump's threats, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) have doubled down on the state and city's sanctuary city policies, which provide protections to undocumented people by barring local police from assisting federal law enforcement activity without a criminal warrant.

Driving the news: The Department of Homeland Security said on X it was launching the blitz ""in honor of Katie Abraham,"" a 20-year-old Illinois woman whom police say was killed along with a friend in a suspected drunken-driving, hit-and-run crash in Urbana in January.

The suspect charged is a 29-year-old man from Guatemala, whom authorities say is an undocumented immigrant.

""This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,"" the DHS X post said.

The DHS did not outline details of the operation, such as how long it will run for, and representatives for the agency, the White House and ICE did not immediately respond to Axios' requests for comment on the matter.

What they're saying: Pritzker said on X the crackdown was not about fighting crime.

""That requires support and coordination — yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,"" he said. ""Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians.""

Johnson said on X the city of Chicago ""received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration.""

He added: ""We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.""

Meanwhile, Johnson wrote in a New York Times op-ed Monday that sending in the National Guard would be ""the wrong solution"" to a real problem.

""If President Trump had listened to the city's leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,"" he said.

""While the causes of crime and violence are complex, it is clear that poverty plays a central role.""

Zoom out: The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted sanctuary cities since the president signed an executive order in April directing federal agencies to document those that were not complying with his hardline immigration agenda.

New Information Released Exposes Trump-Vance Administration’s Unlawful and Inhumane Scheme to Disappear People

Washington, D.C. — The terms of a previously secret grant agreement between the United States and El Salvador facilitating the Trump-Vance administration’s practice of disappearing people indefinitely from U.S. territory into El Salvador’s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison without due process, legal justification, or public accountability have, for the first time, been made available as part of an ongoing lawsuit. The suit, which is pending in federal court in the District of Columbia, is Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights et al. v. U.S. Department of State et al. Plaintiffs, represented by Democracy Forward and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights (who represent themselves), secured the release of the document after filing a motion challenging the federal government’s broad claim that it should remain out of public view.

“This disclosure shows, yet again, that litigation is playing a critical role in securing some measure of transparency from the U.S. government. After the Trump-Vance administration insisted that the terms of its arrangement with El Salvador to facilitate the disappearance of people from U.S. territory be kept secret and out of public view, our team secured the release of this information so the American people can know what their government has done,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “While the American people should not be required to go to court to secure this information, we are pleased that our litigation led to this important information being released. The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses. The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

The public disclosure of this document and its terms marks a significant victory in the ongoing lawsuit. The Trump-Vance administration sought to invoke broad protections from public disclosure over the information, but ultimately backed off after the parties had fully briefed the plaintiffs’ motion for the court to compel the public release of the information.

This first-of-its-kind lawsuit challenges the legality and constitutionality of the agreement between the Trump-Vance administration and the government of El Salvador. During the ongoing litigation, the administration produced correspondence between the U.S. Department of State and El Salvador that outlines key terms of a financial arrangement by which the U.S. paid El Salvador to detain individuals who had been in U.S. territory.

According to the newly released correspondence, El Salvador agreed to detain people rendered from the U.S. before President Trump signed a proclamation purporting to invoke the Alien Enemies Act and to remove individuals from U.S. territory. On March 22, 2025, after the administration ignored a federal court order and removed more than 200 individuals to El Salvador without proper process, the U.S. Department of State provided El Salvador with $4.76 million.

The correspondence indicates that, as a condition of the funds, the U.S. required El Salvador to agree, among other things, to refrain from assisting asylum seekers in obtaining resources and counsel or using the funds to provide reproductive health care. Notably, the grant agreement does not have any provisions requiring that El Salvador refrain from torturing, detaining people in indefinite confinement, or avoiding other abusive practices inside CECOT.

Much has been written about building a southern border wall to stop immigration. But while the fight over black paint, bricks, and steel has dominated headlines, another wall—larger, quieter, and potentially far more damaging—is already rising. This one is invisible. It’s made of visa denials, delays, and mounting barriers that keep students, workers, tourists, and families from reaching the U.S.

Unlike a wall in Texas or Arizona, this new wall stretches across the globe. And it threatens to isolate America in ways we can ill afford.

Consider the numbers. In fiscal year 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered over 2 million people at the southern border. By contrast, the State Department issued almost 11 million temporary visas and hundreds of thousands of green cards during the same time. Many of those people need a visa to enter the U.S. But foreigners are facing a combination of expanded interview requirements, longer wait times, social media vetting, and higher costs to come to the U.S.

Starting this month, the State Department is sharply limiting waivers of visa interviews. Until now, many people did not have to have a visa interview, especially if they were renewing their visa. Although requiring a visa interview sounds innocuous, it will supercharge already crushing wait times.

U.S. consulates are grappling with reduced staffing and increased workload, leading to systemic bottlenecks. For example, it currently takes 11 months to get a tourist visa at the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The next available tourist visa appointment in Abu Dhabi is in 18 months. And visa wait times in India can exceed a year. For employers who need to hire quickly, this is a deal-breaker.

The hurdles don’t stop there. The State Department is reviewing more than 55 million people who have U.S. visas for any violations that might lead to deportation. That will result in more visa delays, denials, and revocations. Indeed, the department has stated that it has revoked more than twice as many visas since the end of January as during the same time period the previous year.

The State Department has also expanded social media vetting of all international student visa applicants to see if they have “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S. The predictable result: a projected 30 to 40 percent plunge in new international student arrivals this fall. That’s a loss not just for universities—it means $7 billion less in revenue for the U.S. and 60,000 jobs wiped out.

Congress has piled on by recently adding a $250 “visa integrity” fee on top of the $185 visa application cost, making U.S. visas among the most expensive in the world. The U.S. Travel Association projects that the integrity fee could cost the U.S. economy $11 billion over three years, including $9.4 billion in lost visitor spending and $1.3 billion in lost tax revenue. That comes on top of a pilot program imposing visa bonds as high as $15,000 for visitors from some countries with high overstay rates.

Meanwhile, a sweeping travel ban now restricts or blocks nationals from 19 countries. In 2022 nearly 300,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. According to a report by the American Immigration Council, those new arrivals made significant contributions to the U.S. economy. In 2023 alone, households led by those recent arrivals “earned $3.2 billion in income, paid $715.6 million in combined federal, state and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.”

Media reports suggest that the administration is weighing imposing restrictions on 36 additional countries. That hasn’t happened yet, but if it does, expanding the bans would choke off even more economic activity.

The damage is already showing. According to one report, U.S. consulates issued 16 percent fewer temporary visas and 20 percent fewer green cards in May 2025 than in May 2024. Over 300,000 fewer overseas visitors came to the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025 compared with the same time period in 2024. The World Travel and Tourism Council projects that international visitor spending in the U.S. will plunge 22 percent this year—a staggering $12.5 billion loss. Among 184 countries studied, the U.S. is the only one expected to see a decline.

The administration defends these measures as necessary for national security. But treating every visitor as a threat keeps out not just terrorists. It keeps out talent. It keeps out paying students. It keeps out families who want to reunite. And it keeps out the millions of ordinary travelers whose spending supports American jobs from Miami to Seattle.

America has prospered for centuries not by walling itself off but by attracting people who bring energy, ideas, and investment. If we continue down this path of suspicion and obstruction, we risk turning the U.S. into a country that fewer and fewer people want to visit, let alone build a future in.

LA community urges Chicago to confront ICE 'head-on' The enforcement raids in Chicago come after the Trump administration targeted the Democrat-led cities of Los Angeles and Washington.","CHICAGO – President Donald Trump's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" is hitting a fever pitch as local leaders claim immigrants are wrongfully being snatched off the street by federal agents looking to root out violent criminals.

The White House vehemently argues that the Chicago operation is aimed at targeting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, but local community members say it's causing fear among law-abiding neighbors. At least four people have been arrested, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

""These abductions were seemingly random, with agents profiling and approaching community members on the street,"" Rey Wences of the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights said at a news conference. ""What we're experiencing today is not normal. People going out in the street and being snatched from their family members is not normal.""

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids began Sunday, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump has said federal agents are targeting ""the worst of the worst"" criminals. The four people arrested have been charged with crimes, an agency spokesperson said in an official statement.

Some Chicagoans say local workers and business owners are being targeted instead of criminals.

""It’s never been about arresting the worst of the worst,"" Alderwoman Jeylú Gutiérrez, the City Council representative for Chicago’s 14th Ward, said at Monday’s news conference. Gutiérrez is an immigrant from Mexico. ""It’s about terrorizing our communities. But we will not be intimidated.""

The Chicago arrests come as the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration in ruling that federal authorities can resume for now the indiscriminate immigration-related stops in Los Angeles that sparked protests and accusations of racial profiling.

In addition to being Democratic strongholds, Chicago and Illinois have long been destinations for immigrants. About a third of the city’s population is Hispanic, according to U.S. Census Data.

Local politicians have responded by protecting immigrants from federal law enforcement. Illinois enacted sanctuary state laws in 2017. Chicago has had sanctuary protection in place since 1985.

Immigrant rights groups are urging Chicagoans to report sightings of federal agents to a hotline. Advocates say they will respond to the reported sightings in person, distribute information on what rights people have when confronted by immigration agents, and record the detainments if advocates arrive in time.

Hundreds of Homeland Security officials are expected to operate from a naval base outside Chicago.

What to know about the ICE raids

Charges against the four people arrested in Chicago Sept. 7 include aggravated sexual assault of a child, domestic battery and armed robbery.

Immigration officials did not immediately respond to questions about where the four men were charged. USA TODAY is not naming them, because it was unclear whether they been convicted on the criminal charges shared by Homeland Security.

In an official statement, an agency spokesperson said ""ICE has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city, which protects them over law-abiding citizens. Since January 20, ICE has arrested some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens in Chicago − gang members, murderers, child rapists, drug traffickers − that roam the community and wreak havoc on neighbors. We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city.""

Latino neighborhoods shutter ahead of raids

Chicago’s Southwest Side has long been a haven for Mexican immigrants. Locals say people living in the area have responded to the raids by taking precautions when leaving for work or by simply not showing up.

""We’ve already seen a huge decrease in people going outside,"" said Any Huamani, a member of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council on the Southwest Side. ""No vendors are outside, people are scared, people are afraid.""

Huamani said people knowing what rights they have when confronted by immigration agents, including the right to ignore questions about immigration status or open a door to agents who lack a warrant, is essential.

""This is what stops agents from trying to kidnap us,"" she said.

Huamani also serves on a team that responds in person to calls to the immigrant rights coalition’s hotline. About 30 such rapid-response teams have been set up around the state in response to the raids, immigration advocates said at the news conference.

LA community urges Chicago to confront ICE 'head-on'

The enforcement raids in Chicago come after the Trump administration targeted the Democrat-led cities of Los Angeles and Washington.

Angeleno immigration advocates told USA TODAY they have already begun sharing information with Chicago advocates on how to handle the raids.

""One of the ways we believe fighting back is important is to not cower when troops are deployed and when ICE raids start to increase,"" said Marisol Marquez, an activist with Centro CSO, an LA immigrant rights group. ""We think that confronting it head-on is the best source of courage for people and resilience.""

Having teams of people ready to respond to immigration agent sightings is a key first step to ensuring people feel safe walking their neighborhoods, Marquez said.

She also said it’s important for communities to continue living their normal lives as much as possible, including proceeding with public events.

""We can’t be shy. We can’t show that we accept the patrolling of the National Guard to terrorize our community,"" Marquez said. ""We want to let our neighbors know not to be discouraged, our community is united, and we will continue to be united.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USAT/86046316007-chicago-trump-ice-02.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-09 10:58:38.514254

So when we talked, uh, you said we assembled, um, that's, that, that's, uh, uh, uh, *** little different than what happened.
That day we had approximately 40 teams spread across, uh, Los Angeles, uh, whether it was the inner city or some of the communities in and around Los Angeles.
And I think more important is the fact that that roving patrol did apprehend, uh, uh, targets.
We just had two assaults on federal officers yesterday here in Los Angeles, just in Los Angeles.","Joining us now is the US Border Patrol sector Chief Gregory Bovino. Chief Avino, thank you so much for making time for us today. Well thank you it's good to be here. Earlier this summer, uh, Chief Pavino, we saw you standing on the steps of the state Capitol after you had just carried out *** raid at *** Home Depot in South Sacramento. You noted you're not going anywhere. I understand *** lot of your work is down there in Southern California, but how are you deciding which communities you go into? Sure, uh, our, the, the communities that we go into and our law enforcement actions like the one you saw in Sacramento, are based on what we call targeted enforcement. Uh, we have predetermined or predefined targets. That we look to uh create *** law enforcement function to to go to, to go after. So that's what we did in Sacramento, uh, that, that, that particular operation, there were some individuals that we were after and we did end up apprehending several individuals that were aggravated felons and some folks that you would not want walking the streets of your community with impunity. Could we expect to see more operations like those up here in Northern California? I know we mainly saw just the one. I understand there are smaller operations, but could we see something like that again? Yes, ma'am. It's, it's very possible. We go where the threat takes us, and Los Angeles, as you know, is rife with illegal immigration and some pretty bad, some pretty bad actors down here in Los Angeles, but we go where that threat is, and if we see *** threat in Sacramento or San Francisco or anywhere else that, that we think we need to go, then, then, then we'll certainly go there and do that. Something we've heard from our local law enforcement up here in Northern California is that California's sanctuary state law, also known as Senate Bill 54, that has tied their hands from working with you there at Border Patrol and with immigration officials overall. I mean, is that accurate in your eyes? Is there *** way you all could work together under the law right now? Sure, well, yeah, they're exactly right. Uh, SB 54 does tie their hands. You know, I started law enforcement in California back in 1996 when there wasn't an SB 54, and the cooperation between state and local law enforcement and immigration officers, whether it was Border Patrol or ICE. It was fantastic and we didn't have the immigration problem that we see now. But with SB 54 and sanctuary cities, sanctuary states and things like that, it creates an atmosphere of lawlessness, especially with immigration, and that's why we're in the communities now, because it's us and us alone. That that prosecute those immigration laws. If we had that, that, that buy-in and that help from the state and locals like we used to, I think you would, you would see *** lot of the communities would be *** lot safer and then you might not see border patrol as much in *** place like Sacramento. But right now when you have child rapists standing in front of Big box stores or aggravated felons that have spent years and years in prison or individuals that may have *** significant criminal record in *** foreign country when those folks are in the community and nothing can be done about it, that's why you're going to see us in those communities and when I said we're not going anywhere, that's what I'm talking about. The mission's not. Accomplished until those individuals are taken off the streets and as you know as we go after those individuals, anyone else that is an illegal alien is subject to arrest. Are there any local jurisdictions that you think are handling this properly or doing *** lot? Therefore, you are not in those communities that you could share? Uh, uh, again, we'll go where that threat is. I think there are some, some jurisdictions that, uh, that do the best job that they can. Again, that they are restricted from, from working with immigration officers, uh, with, with *** few exceptions. However, there are some jurisdictions that, uh, that we know do *** fantastic job, you know, whether it's Sheriff Youngblood. Uh, down in Bakersfield, Sheriff Bianco and, and, and some of the sheriffs do *** fantastic job in keeping their community safe. I can't say enough about the fact they, they do communicate and would love to work with us if they could. So we're we're, we, we'll work with anyone that we can, any state or local agency, anywhere, anytime, any place. Switching gears to an operation. *** group of Southern California Democrats in Congress are demanding answers from you and other high ranking officials in the Trump administration after you and several agents assembled outside of Governor Gavin Newsom's recent press conference in LA. He was launching *** push by Democrats to try to redistrict here in California to send more Democrats to the US House of Representatives. Chief, why were you there outside of that press conference? So when we talked, uh, you said we assembled, um, that's, that, that's, uh, uh, uh, *** little different than what happened. That's called *** roving patrol function, something that we do every day in Los Angeles. That day we had approximately 40 teams spread across, uh, Los Angeles, uh, whether it was the inner city or some of the communities in and around Los Angeles. So there were over. 40 law enforcement teams, several 100 law enforcement officers. You just happen to see us and me there, but I think what's important is that roving patrol function was within about *** block of our ICE facility, *** facility that we that we work out of every day. So, uh, you know, I'm, I'm glad that Governor Newsom and anyone else was in, in our territory. which is, is, is what that was, um, within just *** few steps of, of *** location that we work out of every day. And I think more important is the fact that that roving patrol did apprehend, uh, uh, targets. One of those targets was *** train de Aragua member Train Day Aragua, as you know, is the Venezuelangan. that terrorizes Ma and Pa America, that individual was within about 2 blocks of the location that you just talked about. That individual was taken off the streets. So I think that, uh, we accomplished the mission that day and we're going to continue to be in that area and all areas of Los Angeles, anywhere, anytime, uh, that the threat dictates that we're there. Governor Gavin Newsom and other California leaders have been pointing specifically to your operations as *** key reason for why people should show up to the polls this November to approve that democratic redistricting effort to allow again more Democrats to go to the US House of Representatives. I mean, what's your response to that, chief? Yeah, as far as the politics, I'm gonna, I'm going to stay out of the politics. I'm definitely apolitical, but what I will say is anyone that chooses illegal aliens over American citizens, that chooses criminals, that chooses Train dearagua walking our streets, whether it's Los Angeles. Or your fine city of Sacramento, uh, I, you know, I've got *** problem with that, and, um, I, I, I, I think that that's probably *** message that uh people don't want to hear, uh, uh, whether it's paying an illegal alien $300 to stay. In the United States and possibly continue to commit crimes or supporting criminality in general. So if that's *** message that anyone wants to send, whether it's the governor or anyone else, then you know, I can't imagine anyone that would be in support of something like that. I think that the citizens of California, the citizens of America, are ready for law and order when you have several million. Individuals pour across that border over *** 4 year period. Several million, many of whom have significant criminal histories. Uh, something has to be done about that because those individuals go on to prey on the citizens in our great country, you know, I'm talking about that just this morning. We apprehended our 5,000th apprehension here in Los Angeles since I've been here. That's just over the past couple of months, our 5000. And guess what that 5,000th was? That individual spent approximately 164 months in prison, was an aggravated felon. That was our 5,000th apprehension today. Um, so do we want people like that walking the streets of Sacramento or Los Angeles or Bakersfield or San Francisco? Uh, think about that and what damage that individual or other individuals or the thousands of other individuals nationwide could do to our communities, our families, our children, that's the way I look at it. And as long as those individuals are walking the streets. I'm going to be here taking them off the streets. The US Border Patrol, the green team, will be on the streets, whether it's Sacramento or anywhere else. We're going to be on the streets taking them off the streets because that's why we're here and we're not going anywhere. I keep saying we're not going anywhere. The more of those that we apprehend, the harder we go. Understood, Chief Avino, before I let you go, my last one here, there's still this proposal moving through our state capital that would prohibit all officers, and it attempts to include those officers at the federal level from covering their faces. This was filed in response to some of your operations. I mean, what's your response to the existence of this proposal and, and why are your officers covering their faces? Sure, you know, that, that it reminds me *** lot of SB 54, um, supporting criminality over the protection of our American citizens and our communities. Uh, they can pass those state laws, but again, we're federal officers that, uh, Title 10. Uh, privilege privileges and immunities, um, would exempt us obviously from something like that. So they can pass all the laws that would be more, um, you know, wishful thinking, I think, than an actual law. We're going to protect our agents, you know, many, uh, politicians, many individuals are calling for, take MS-13, for instance, to take positions up against law enforcement, specifically immigration officers, and that type of Rhetoric. That type of damaging rhetoric is why we have *** 1,000% increase in assaults on federal officers, 1,000% increase. We just had two assaults on federal officers yesterday here in Los Angeles, just in Los Angeles. So while that's being, while that's being done, and it puts our agents in danger, whether they're being docked or followed or, or, or whatever. I'm gonna protect those agents and face coverings make sense. And the protection of our agents. So, you know, as long as that rhetoric's out there, um, I'm gonna make sure those agents are protected, and that's one method for protecting our agents. So, you know, uh, scale down that rhetoric and cooperate so we can get the, the violent criminals and the bad people and bad things off the streets, and then you might not have us there in the first place. All right, Chief Gregory Bovino, thank you so much for your time. Thank you very much.

About two months after border patrol agents raided a Home Depot parking lot in South Sacramento, federal officials have confirmed more immigration raids like that are likely in Northern California.

The case is one of many lawsuits challenging the White House’s efforts to supersede Congress’ spending authority by canceling funding without lawmakers’ explicit approval.

This particular case became more complicated in late August when the Trump administration sent Congress a rescission request, asking lawmakers to cancel billions in foreign aid, including some of the funding subject to this lawsuit.

This “pocket rescission,” as it’s sometimes called, came within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year. Under the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law, they believe that allows them to cancel the funding even if Congress refuses to go along with the proposal.

The move is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and evoked ire from senior lawmakers, including Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine.

“Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse,” Collins wrote in a statement. “Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”

Administration sees executive branch ‘at war with itself’

The appeal to the Supreme Court filed Monday urges the justices to let the legislative and executive branches figure out the spending dispute on their own and criticizes a federal district court for ordering the Trump administration to spend the money.

“The injunction requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself,” wrote Solicitor General D. John Sauer. “Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients.”

The pocket rescissions request at the center of this case is separate from the one Trump sent Congress in early June that asked members to eliminate funding for numerous foreign aid accounts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Lawmakers approved that proposal in July after preserving full funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

Congress has yet to act on the second rescissions request as its leaders look for ways to fund the government ahead of an Oct. 1 shutdown deadline.

Attorneys for the organizations that brought the lawsuit — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Global Health Council — wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court submitted Monday that they opposed the Trump administration’s request to overturn the lower court’s preliminary injunction.

“USAID and the State Department have been under a duty to obligate these funds since at least March 2024, when Congress enacted the appropriations; they chose not to act sooner,” they wrote. “The government faces no cognizable harm from having to take steps to comply with the law for the short period while this Court considers its stay application.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation ""will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,"" even though the libertarian CATO Institute revealed in June that 65% of immigrants booked by the agency under Trump had no criminal convictions and over 93% were never convicted of violent offenses.

Like Trump has in recent days, McLaughlin took aim at Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, saying that he ""and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago's streets—putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals.""

While Chicagoans have made their thoughts on a federal invasion clear, carrying signs that said ""No Trump! No Troops!"" and ""No Nazis—No Kings"" during a weekend protest, McLaughlin said that Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ""have a clear message: No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.""

Pritzker and Chicago's Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson, have forcefully pushed back against Trump's threats to launch a major anti-migrant operation in the city and possibly deploy the National Guard, as he has done in Washington, DC and Los Angeles, California.

In a New York Times opinion piece published hours before the widely anticipated DHS announcement, Johnson argued that ""lowering crime rates here does not require an occupation of our city by armed members of the National Guard, as the White House continues to threaten us with. Chicagoans, including survivors of violence, have spoken out against such an extreme measure.""

""If President Trump had listened to the city's leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,"" wrote the mayor, who signed an executive order ahead of the federal operation and is raising a family in Austin on the West Side, ""one of the parts of our city where gun violence is most pervasive.""

""My administration has managed to make progress in crime reduction with three interconnected strategies: effective and law-abiding policing, violence prevention, and addressing the root causes of crime,"" Johnson explained. ""Our violence prevention work includes programs that employ former gang members to de-escalate conflicts as well as initiatives that connect people to jobs and resources.""

""We have directed funding to neighborhoods that have suffered from chronic disinvestment to create jobs, provide mental health services, and more. We are on track to build, rehab, or preserve over 10,000 units of affordable housing,"" he continued. ""We don't need the National Guard; we just need to invest in what works.""

In a Monday statement, Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates acknowledged ""the successful efforts of our mayor in reducing crime and investing in our community,"" and similarly stressed that whatever Trump is ""spending on his raids is better spent on building affordable housing, reopening school libraries, and funding social workers to support children through the trauma this administration is inflicting on an entire generation who are worried every day if they will ever see their parents again.""

""As a history teacher, I can tell you that history will not look kindly on Donald Trump or the individuals who are acting as his personal army,"" Davis Gates also said. ""For weeks, the people of Chicago have made it clear that we do not need federal agents in our city, whether that is to separate immigrant families or racially profile in our Black neighborhoods.""

""Chicago might have been built to keep our communities divided, but we are coming together now, like working people do against any bad boss, in radical solidarity to keep each other safe,"" the union leader added. ""Donald Trump and his departments of alphabet boys and National Guard troops aren't welcome and aren't needed in Chicago.""

Congressional Democrats who represent Illinois have also denounced the president's targeting of the country's third-largest city—including Sen. Dick Durbin, who took to the chamber's floor on Monday following the DHS announcement. Durbin accused Trump of attacking Chicago for ""political theater.""

While the Trump administration hasn't yet provided any update on the involvement of the National Guard, after the president moved to rename the US Department of Defense, he took to his Truth Social platform on Saturday morning with an image referencing the 1979 film Apocalypse Now and said, ""Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""

Appearing on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), said that ""we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago,"" but also that ""the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal... This is not acceptable behavior.""

Responding to the recent developments in a Monday statement, Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the national advocacy group America's Voice, said that ""we have gone from a supposed war on immigrants to a war on Americans.""

""America's Voice has long said that immigration was merely the 'tip of the spear' for this administration to justify and lead an attack on all of us—including violating due process, constitutional rights, and core democratic norms and pillars, such as deploying the military against American communities,"" she noted. ""Sadly, all are coming to pass.""

Cárdenas continued: ""Why is the American president openly threatening an American city, as he readies the deployment of American troops against those residents? It's not about immigration, just as the Washington, DC deployment wasn't about crime. Instead, it's for purposes of retribution; sowing fear and dissent; provoking violence and dividing us as a nation.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61567913&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C84%2C0%2C85,N,,2025-09-09 12:58:04.881845

Gavin Newsom vowed to “continue fighting” after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted restrictions on immigration raids in Los Angeles, but the state might not have many options.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged as much during a press conference Monday where he said he was disappointed in the decision but added that he respects the rule of law.

Bonta: “The rationale articulated by Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh is dangerous and wrong. But he’s a Supreme Court justice and I’m not.”

As CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos explain, the country’s highest court handed President Donald Trump’s administration a win by lifting a restraining order that limited agents from conducting “roving patrols” and stopping people in part based on their appearance.

In addition to L.A., the ruling will likely have major impacts across the country, as immigration agents ramp up operations in Chicago, Boston and elsewhere.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, on social media: “This is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous — it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the U.S.”

While noting that California is not a party in the lawsuit, Bonta remained non-committal about the state’s options following the ruling, saying that it will monitor the dispute and potentially file an amicus brief should the involved parties respond to the court’s decision.

Meanwhile Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas hinted at possible legislative actions to push back against Trump “with everything we’ve got.”

Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, in a statement: “We’ve already passed laws to prevent raids in our schools and hospitals. … The only way we stop Trump is by standing together.”

A federal judge issued the restraining order in July, siding with civil rights, immigrant rights and local government agencies that argued that immigration agents were violating Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

But in a 6-3 decision the Supreme Court granted the administration’s emergency request to lift that order, with the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissenting.

Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion explaining his reasoning to lift restrictions: “Ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

CA officials honor ‘progressive warrior’ John Burton

The California Senate took a moment to honor one of its legends when it returned to business, recognizing John Burton, who died Sunday at the age of 92.

Describing him as one of the Senate’s “finest members,” Senate president pro tem Mike Mcguire of Santa Rosa led the chamber on Monday in a moment of silence to honor the former lawmaker and California Democratic Party leader.

Known for his brash way of speaking, Burton was a key figure in Democratic politics in California for decades. News of his passing drew multiple honors and tributes from California’s top officials, including from those whose careers were shaped by Burton, such as Gov. Newsom and Rep. Nancy Pelosi.

Newsom, in a statement: “There was no greater champion for the poor, the bullied, the disabled, and forgotten Californians than John Burton. … His legacy is not only written in the policies he helped enact, but in the countless lives he touched and uplifted, including my own.”

Newsom directed flags to be flown at half-staff, and the governor plans to posthumously induct Burton into the California Hall of Fame. In her tribute, Pelosi described Burton as a “towering progressive warrior,” while close friend and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that Burton’s influence was “immeasurable.”

School unions a maybe on sex abuse bill

California lawmakers are considering a bill that would help protect schoolchildren from being sexually abused by educators, but the measure faces opposition by some teacher’s unions, writes Matt Drange for CalMatters.

In addition to requiring training for teachers and students on how to recognize signs of sexual grooming, Senate Bill 848 would mandate district officials to report and track “egregious” instances of employee misconduct. It would also create a hiring database that administrators must use to vet prospective teachers for potential misconduct.

The database is intended to curb the practice of schools re-hiring teachers who have resigned from another school after being accused of sexual misconduct. The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, notably does not oppose the bill, despite opposing similar legislation in past years. The California Federation of Teachers and the California School Employees Association do, however, citing concerns over due process.

Tristan Brown, California Federation of Teachers’ legislative director. “We need to ensure a policy that captures individuals that are unfit to work in education while making sure innocent and unfairly charged employees have fair access to justice.”

And lastly: CA sues LA over jail conditions

Attorney General Bonta on Monday said the state is suing L.A. County over its jails’ “inhumane conditions,” and high rates of in-custody deaths despite decades of court monitoring. Learn more from CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.

California Voices

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Relations between state and local governments have been particularly tense in the final week of the legislative session due to bills related to affordable housing and workers’ compensation.

To save lives and prevent heat-related illnesses, lawmakers need to establish a state policy requiring housing units to maintain a safe maximum indoor temperature, writes Pedro Zacarias, a farmworker and advocate in the Purepecha community.

Recently Nigel Farage outlined Reform UK’s policies for “deporting all illegal migrants and securing the UK’s borders”, titled “Operation Restoring Justice”. The policies can be summarized as “detect, detain, deport”.

A main – though not the only – target of these policies is those crossing the Channel in small boats who, while their entry to the UK is unauthorized, almost all currently claim asylum when current laws give them protection against immediate detention and deportation. Under Reform UK’s proposals those crossing will not be allowed to settle in Britain and will be removed asap, perhaps to their own countries or perhaps to third countries. For this to be legal, laws need to be changed and the proposals suggest an emergency 5-year suspension of a variety of human rights laws and international obligations, including the Refugee Convention and the European Court of Human Rights. The right to claim asylum would be removed and with it the right not to be imprisoned and to avoid non-refoulement (removal to unsafe countries). Nigel Farage explicitly said that he is prepared to negotiate a returns agreement with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Asylum might still be offered by the UK to some groups but who and in what numbers would be determined by the UK government, not who manages to arrive in the UK.

Almost certainly Reform UK are under-estimating the difficult of the “detect” part of their proposal.

A lot of objections to these proposals have been on legal and ethical grounds. I am neither a lawyer nor a philosopher so will not primarily comment on these aspects. Instead, what would this strategy mean in practice, and would it work?

The practical difficulties of detecting and detaining asylum seekers

First, consider the “detect” part. At the moment those arriving in small boats are not worried about being detected as almost all claim asylum. But, if the consequence of detection was detention and deportation, those entering the country would seek ways to enter without detection. Smugglers’ strategies would evolve. And many illegal migrants in the UK are visa over-stayers or who arrived by other means. To find them is a difficult and costly exercise. In the US Donald Trump has tripled the budget for ICE. Inevitably some of the accused of being illegally in the UK will claim they are legal (and some will be, and minorities will be more likely to be victims) so it is hard to avoid some type of due process to determine legality which takes time and costs money. Almost certainly Reform UK are under-estimating the difficult of the “detect” part of their proposal.

What about “detention”. If detention (potentially of unlimited and indeterminate duration) is deemed legal, problems are likely if the numbers being held are large as there are likely to be allegations of ill-treatment and self-harm (there always have been in other countries) and it can be expensive. If most in detention are quickly deported then the policy may be effective in reducing the numbers of unauthorized border crossings as the threat of deportation will be credible; numbers detained will then be small. But if deportation is harder than anticipated then not only will the outflow from detention be lower but the absence of a credible threat to deport means that fewer unauthorized migrants are deterred so the inflow into detention would also be higher. The numbers liable to detention could grow fast, proving difficult for the government to maintain the policy at all.

Making deals with unpleasant regimes

So the success of the policy (in its own terms) depends on how easy deportation is. Deportation can only proceed with the agreement of a receiving country. The receiving country might be the country of origin of a third country. Third-party agreements may make striking headlines (think of Donald Trump sending handfuls of migrants to Eswatini and South Sudan) but are small-scale. The doomed Rwanda scheme of the previous government had a capacity of at most 200 people, and would quickly have been at capacity at which point it would be unlikely to have any deterrent effect.

So agreements with origin countries would be needed for large-scale deportations and the proposal is explicit about being prepared to negotiate agreements some unpleasant regimes, specifically the Taliban in Afghanistan, currently the most common nationality crossing in small boats. In these negotiations all countries will see the possibility for advantage. Sometimes it is argued that the UK should use the threat of lower aid or harder trade or fewer visas. But the countries with the most citizens crossing are not countries where there is much scope for this. Aid to places like Afghanistan and Eritrea are largely routed through humanitarian NGOs rather directly to the government. The UK government could threaten the Taliban with reducing support to women there but it is hard to imagine them caring very much.

So there will be payments from the UK to some unpleasant governments – Farage has made no secret that he is prepared to strike such deals. But they are likely to be subject to protracted negotiations; meanwhile the numbers in detention may rack up. In July 2025 Germany returned 81 failed Afghan asylum-seekers with criminal convictions but in a deal brokered by Qatar in the absence of direct links with the Taliban and with little indication of what the Taliban received in return. The Taliban probably know that Nigel Farage wants this deal much more than them, so will negotiate hard if the aim is to deport thousands. It is also not hard to imagine governments undermining the agreements in plausibly deniable ways – perhaps surreptitiously encouraging emigrants and then arguing more money is needed to take back more people.

There are many ways in which Reform UK’s policy could end in failure, even on its own terms.

I suspect that Nigel Farage might want the message “I don’t like the Taliban any more than you but the fact that I am prepared to strike a deal with them shows how serious a problem this is for the UK”. Whether that message could survive the reality is debatable. Some sent back would very likely be persecuted, tortured or killed leading to scandals. Some in the UK may not care but most will think it wrong. Within a few days of the policy being launched Nigel Farage has said that women and children would not be sent back, then said they would, and it’s not hard to envisage carve-outs (perhaps Afghans claiming they served with the British there) from what was initially billed as a “no exceptions” policy. And a possible exception means a process to determine whether someone should be returned and a weakening of the deterrent.

Brexit has made things harder, not easier

There are many ways in which Reform UK’s policy could end in failure, even on its own terms. Nevertheless, some voters may think it worth a shot as nothing else has worked. But, from previous similar episodes we actually know what works. It’s not been the “safe and legal” routes one often hears mentioned as an alternative – those ideas have their own problems.

Let’s give some examples. Australia has managed to end maritime arrivals, through a range of international cooperative agreements notably an agreement to return those who try to Indonesia, something Nigel Farage mentioned as working but does not seem to have understood the implication. The US has reduced encounters at its Southern border from a peak of 360 thousand in December 2023 to a level of 4,600 in July 2025. This has not mostly happened because of high-profile stunts like deporting migrants to third countries but through a policy (starting under Biden but continued under Trump) of expediting removals through agreements with countries to return illegal migrants home or to remain in Mexico. In these and other examples, it is agreement with the countries of departure which has worked; think of the EU’s agreement with Turkey in 2016. For Channel crossings that means cooperation with Europe, or at the very least France. That is probably anathema to Nigel Farage and the cheerfully discusses negotiations with the Taliban but not with the French.

Brexit made it easier to control managed migration even if Boris Johnson’s government did not exercise much control. But Brexit made it harder to manage unauthorized migration – a loss of access to European databases and the disappearance of returns agreements. Brexit has made the UK an appeal court for failed asylum seekers from the EU. But it’s through working primarily with Europe not Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran that the solution to the small boat crossings will be found if it is found at all. That is basically the strategy of the current government.

The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters. It means immigration agents can legally resume aggressive street sweeps that began in early June in Los Angeles, the epicenter for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

In a 31-page ruling, the Supreme Court, by a 6-3 majority, agreed with the Trump administration that federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate individuals about whether they are lawfully in the United States and that they can rely on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion. That means everything the officer knew and observed at the time of the stop.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, is used for cases that are handled speedily with limited briefing and typically no oral argument. The justices often issue unsigned orders with little or no explanation.

The ruling means the Border Patrol can resume the aggressive tactics a district federal judge said violated people’s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.

In a brief asking justices to remove restrictions on immigration stops, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security wrote that the lower-court injunction interfered with agents’ efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants.

“The injunction raises the specter of contempt for every stop in the district, threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop. It chills the exercise of Executive authority and usurps the President’s Article II powers to enforce our immigration laws,” attorneys for the Trump administration wrote.

The district court found, based on a “mountain of evidence,” that the government engaged in a pattern of conducting stops without reasonable suspicion—relying solely on traits like race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, the location a person is in, and the type of work a person does.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the lower court’s ruling, chiding the Trump administration for misrepresenting the restraining order in their appeal.

“If, as the Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing … stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit wrote.

A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers, sought the order, arguing the LA-area raids have violated people’s rights by allowing federal immigration agents to stop people who simply appear to be Latino, including U.S. citizens.

“The federal government is seeking to detain individuals solely because they are not white, speak Spanish or speak accented English. That idea is anathema to everything the United States stands for, and it should be rejected,” a group of cities in Los Angeles County wrote in amicus brief supporting restrictions on immigration agents. They wrote that this summer’s raids had “sown terror” in their communities.

Despite the previous order barring profiling, agents have continued an aggressive enforcement blitz in the nation’s second-largest city.

About 40 agents hit a Westlake Home Depot on Aug. 28, using tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse a crowd before detaining eight people, a Border Patrol official confirmed Friday. That’s the same location where agents previously made a hype video set to rap music of themselves hiding in a Penske rental truck before bursting out to detain day laborers in a raid dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.

Under Operation-At-Large Chief Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol has detained Latino daylaborers, swarming Home Depots and carwashes across the nation’s second largest city. Bovino has vowed to bring similar tactics to cities across the country.

Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law said the federal government’s racial profiling has consequences beyond immigration enforcement. He wrote to CalMatters and also in a paper for the SMU Law Review that “race-based immigration enforcement undermines Latina/o sense of belonging in the national community for generations.”

“Importantly, the Trump administration’s campaign against people of color goes well beyond immigration law and immigrants.

In a series of posts on X, Johnson said the city of Chicago did not receive notice about the initiative, and he raised concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement's track record and links to human rights abuses.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment via email on Tuesday outside regular working hours.

Why It Matters

Operation Midway Blitz is the latest instance of the Trump administration intensifying federal immigration crackdowns on Democratic-led cities this summer, citing crime and public safety concerns as justification.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from local leaders—including Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker—who argue that it is intended to intimidate rather than reduce crime, noting that federal authorities have not attempted to coordinate with local officials.

What To Know

The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that it was launching the initiative in Chicago and across Illinois following the death of Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old college student killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run allegedly caused by Guatemalan national Julio Cucul-Bol.

The department said ""criminal illegal aliens"" had flocked to the state because Pritzker's sanctuary policies allowed them ""to roam free on American streets.""

Johnson said on X that the city of Chicago received no notice on the new ICE operation before it launched.

He said the city remained opposed to ""any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process"" and cited ICE's track record of ""detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.""

The mayor went on to name several examples of ICE's enforcement practices and reported misconduct.

He cited one incident in which ICE deported an American child with Stage IV kidney cancer to Honduras along with his mother, a case that is now the subject of a lawsuit.

Johnson also referenced a report from Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff's office that identified hundreds of cases of human rights abuses in immigration detention centers around the county.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday, along with a meme referencing the 1979 Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now: ""'I love the smell of deportations in the morning...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker wrote on X: ""This isn't about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination—yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks. Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson wrote on X: ""Chicago doesn't want to see reckless, unconstitutional, militarized immigration enforcement in our city.""

What Happens Next

The government has released few details about what Operation Midway Blitz will entail.

It remains to be seen whether Trump will send National Guard members to Chicago to accompany ICE, as he did in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer.

The move came in response to a federal judge's ruling last week that requires the administration to spend the funds despite President Donald Trump notifying Congress that he intends not to.

The case marks a showdown over to what extent the president can refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated, a brewing issue as Trump has embraced a sweeping view of presidential power since taking office again in January.

In the new filing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer described the case as raising “a grave and urgent threat” to the power of the presidency.

Under the Constitution, it is the job of Congress to allocate funds that the president can spend.

Current federal funding expires on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.

The dispute involves a law called the Impoundment Control Act, which was passed in 1974 to regulate the president’s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.

Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali has been at the center of the complicated litigation, which has raged for months as the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The underlying lawsuit was brought by various groups that receive foreign-aid funding, led by the Global Health Council.

Prior to the current administration, USAID spent billions every year on programs in developing countries addressing such issues as malaria and AIDs prevention and improving access to water.

In his ruling last week, Ali said the government must spend the money unless Congress votes to approve Trump's request.

But in Monday's filing, Sauer said that Ali's order imposes impossible burdens on the administration.

""To have any hope of complying in time, the executive branch would have to immediately commence diplomatic discussions with foreign nations about the use of those funds — discussions the President considers counterproductive to foreign policy — and notify Congress about planned obligations that the President is strongly opposing,"" he added.

In a filing in response, the plaintiffs urged the court not to immediately block Ali's ruling, saying it merely requires the government to make plans to spend the money by the end of the month. If Congress approves Trump's request, the money would not have to be spent, they added.

On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined to block Ali's decision, prompting the Trump administration to turn to the Supreme Court.

The crux of the legal fight is over nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved aid that President Donald Trump last month said he would not spend, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that the Republican administration’s decision to withhold the funding was likely illegal.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter on Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent.

Ali said Congress would have to approve the rescission proposal for the Trump administration to withhold the money. The law is “explicit that it is congressional action — not the President’s transmission of a special message — that triggers rescission of the earlier appropriations,” he wrote.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs. The administration turned to the high court after a panel of federal appellate judges declined to block Ali’s ruling.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer called the ruling “an unlawful injunction that precipitates an unnecessary emergency and needless interbranch conflict.” He urged the justices to immediately block it.

But lawyers for the nonprofit organizations that sued the government said it’s the funding freeze that violates federal law, noting that it has shut down funding for even the most urgent lifesaving programs abroad.

“This marks the third time in this case alone that the Administration has run to the Supreme Court in a supposed emergency posture to seek relief from circumstances of its own making — this time to defend the illegal tactic of a ‘pocket rescission,’” attorney Lauren Bateman of Public Citizen Litigation Group, lead counsel for the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition plaintiffs, said in a statement. “The Administration is effectively asking the Supreme Court to bless its attempt to unlawfully accumulate power.”

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

After Trump issued his rescission notice, the plaintiffs returned to Ali’s court and the judge issued the order that’s now being challenged.

This story is a collaboration between the newsletter Down from DC and The Assembly.

The company that owns North Carolina’s only private federal prison facility is negotiating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to reopen it as a detention center, potentially for immigrants awaiting deportation.

Rivers Correctional Institution, in rural Hertford County, closed in 2021 when the Biden administration ended federal contracts with the private prison industry, citing dangerous conditions at those facilities.

ICE has contracts with county jails in Alamance and New Hanover counties for about 30 prisoners, but a contract with Rivers, which has capacity for more than 1,000 prisoners, could introduce large-scale detention of immigrants to North Carolina and a return to for-profit detention in a state where immigration enforcement remains a deeply partisan issue.

The GEO Group, among the largest private prison companies in the country, told investors last month that it was talking with ICE about reopening Rivers and five other idled prisons as part of the $45 billion expansion in immigration detention Congress approved in the massive budget and spending bill it passed this summer.

George C. Zoley, executive chairman of GEO, described the negotiations during an August 6 call with investors about second-quarter earnings. He named Rivers and prisons in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Colorado as the six he hoped to reopen. Combined, the facilities would hold 5,900 people.

“We are in active discussions with both ICE and U.S. Marshals Service for the potential activation of these facilities,” Zoley said on the call, adding: “We continue to be pleased with the pace of these contract discussions and remain optimistic that additional contract awards will materialize during the third and fourth quarters of the year.”

Christopher V. Ferreira, director of corporate relations for GEO, referred questions about the potential reopening of Rivers to ICE. ICE did not reply to multiple emails or a phone call requesting comment.

An August Washington Post story identified Rivers as part of an unprecedented expansion in detention to temporarily hold the immigrants the Trump administration intends to deport. The Post obtained ICE internal documents which reportedly indicate a detailed plan for a vast system of public and private prisons to meet ICE’s goal of doubling detentions from 50,000 to more than 100,000 by January. The Post reports that GEO stands to gain at least nine new or modified detention contracts worth $500 million.

This week, the Post followed up that story with a close look at the safety records of three of the facilities under consideration by the Trump administration–including one operated by GEO in Texas–and found a history of violence and abuse with fewer standards today than under earlier administrations for humane treatment of prisoners. An ICE official told the Post that specific facilities laid out in the planning documents obtained by the newspaper could change.

Even before Congress approved money for new detention facilities, federal authorities had been setting up centers to hold the surging number of detainees being held for violating immigration law. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis invoked emergency powers to build one such facility at a remote airfield in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The makeshift facility holds 3,000 in what news reports describe as unsanitary conditions, with migrants living in mosquito-infested tents. A federal judge in Florida ordered it closed last month over violations of environmental protection rules, but an appeals court last week overruled that order to keep the facility open.

The largest detention facility, a 1,000-bed tent camp, opened last month at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, with a planned expansion to 5,000. The Trump administration now faces questions over the $1.2 billion building contract awarded to a company, Acquisition Logistics, with no prior prison experience.

GEO has contracted with federal agencies for decades. Rivers closed in 2021, when the Federal Bureau of Prisons let its contract with GEO expire as part of an overall policy to shrink the federal prison system, especially its reliance on for-profit facilities.

President Joe Biden laid out that policy in an executive order he signed at the beginning of his term. “There is broad consensus that our current system of mass incarceration imposes significant costs and hardships on our society and communities and does not make us safer,” the order said. “To decrease incarceration levels, we must reduce profit-based incentives to incarcerate by phasing out the Federal Government’s reliance on privately operated criminal detention facilities.”

The executive order also cited dangerous conditions for inmates and staff at private prisons as a reason for ending those contracts. “The Federal Government also has a responsibility to ensure the safe and humane treatment of those in the Federal criminal justice system,” the order read, citing a 2016 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice that found that “privately operated criminal detention facilities do not maintain the same levels of safety and security for people in the Federal criminal justice system or for correctional staff.”

That report, which included findings from a visit by inspectors to Rivers, described high rates of violence, contraband, inadequate medical care, and drug use among all 14 private federal prisons. Of the North Carolina prison, the report said: “Rivers had the highest rates of contraband finds (excluding cell phones), inmate assaults on staff, uses of force, guilty findings on inmate discipline cases, inmate grievances, positive drug tests, inmate-on-inmate sexual misconduct and the lowest phone monitoring rate.”

When it closed four years ago, Rivers held 1,450 inmates, mostly migrants serving sentences for criminal convictions before being deported and about 160 U.S. citizens with criminal convictions from Washington, D.C., many of them mentally ill, according to press reports. The 336 people who worked at Rivers at the time were laid off. According to the GEO website, Rivers now has capacity for 1,320 prisoners.

U.S. Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), whose district includes Hertford County, said in an email: “It is crucial that any facility converted into an ICE detention center complies with operational standards to ensure the humane treatment of its detainees. I would expect nothing less. I also believe that stakeholders, including community members, should be included in these discussions.”

U.S. Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both Republicans from North Carolina, did not respond to requests for comment.

In the first six months of his administration, President Donald Trump has made good on his campaign promise to crack down on undocumented immigrants. As of the end of August, the number of immigrants in detention had reached an all-time high of 61,226 according to Austin Kocher, a researcher at Syracuse University who publishes a newsletter on immigration data.

On the campaign trail, Trump frequently railed against “the worst of the worst” and “Biden’s migrant crime.” But his administration has not solely focused on removing convicted criminals–far from it. So far, according to Kocher’s analysis, only 36 percent of those detained have criminal convictions, while about a third face criminal charges for which they have not yet been tried. The last third are accused only of immigration violations.

ICE has arrested 2,200 people in North Carolina since President Trump took office, but the enforcement activity here has not been as visible as in larger urban centers like Los Angeles, Miami, and New York. According to press reports, about 60 percent of undocumented immigrants deported from North Carolina were not arrested in raids of businesses or homes. Rather, they were already in jail and turned over to ICE by local sheriffs.

In their call with investors last month, officials at GEO said that the company is imprisoning 20,000 immigrants, the highest number in its history, through existing contracts with ICE at 21 facilities. These facilities could hold as many as 25,000. In addition to detention facilities, GEO officials said that the company also expects significant growth in its electronic monitoring of immigrants and ground transportation and flights used for deportations. Throughout the call, Zoley referred to “unprecedented growth opportunities” for GEO.

The GEO group invested heavily in President Trump’s reelection. According to an analysis by ABC News, a subsidiary of GEO contributed $1 million to Make America Great Again Inc. In its earnings call with investors following the election, company officials predicted revenue growth of $400 million just from expanding or filling unused capacity at existing prisons. ABC quoted Zoley: “What is new is a potential sea change by the incoming Trump administration that is expected to implement a much more aggressive policy towards interior and border immigration enforcement.”

In its most recent financial reports, GEO reported total revenue of $1.2 billion and net income of $48.6 million in the first six months of the year. Its leadership sees that increasing if the contracts for the six idle facilities are awarded.

“If fully utilized, these six facilities could generate up to approximately $310 million in annualized revenue,” Zoley said in the August earnings call.

National Guard troops have been patrolling the streets of U.S. cities, as a prelude to weapons of war being deployed against American citizens.

Yet as Trump has dramatically stepped up his use of military force, fellow Republicans in Congress — where authorization for such actions is supposed to originate — have done little but cheer him on.

That’s giving the president significant leeway as he raises plans to send troops next to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans.

“If I were one of those mayors, I’d be glad to have the help,” said Senator Roger Wicker, R-MS, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, speaking from a Capitol building where National Guard troops were patrolling the surrounding city. “I think the big city Democrats are really making a mistake. I think they’re being tone deaf.”

Lawmakers from Louisiana — a red state that surrounds politically blue New Orleans — said it was a great idea for National Guard troops to go there next.

“New Orleans, like most Democrat-run cities, has a high crime rate, so it would be helpful,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told The Associated Press.

Senator John Kennedy, R-LA, agreed: “We need all the help we can get. I’m delighted to bring in the National Guard.”

Republicans have in recent years found political success focusing on the issue of crime. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities, according to recent polling from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents, and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats. However, statistics show overall crime is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.

HOW TRUMP’S USE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD IS UNIQUE

In the past, the use of National Guard troops on American soil was reserved for extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters or when local officials became overwhelmed by civil unrest or disorder. Rarely have presidents used the troops for law enforcement purposes.

Notable examples include the 1894 Pullman strike in Chicago, during the Civil Rights era to enforce desegregation in the South, and in 1992 during deadly rioting after police officers brutally beat motorist Rodney King and were acquitted on state charges.

Experts say that Trump’s crime mission stands out because he’s not responding to a particular crisis. Instead, Trump is using the military to implement his domestic policies, whether that means using military aircraft for deportation flights, beefing up military at the U.S.-Mexico border or ordering National Guard troops to be ready for law enforcement duties.

“All of these things indicate an administration that is making a broad, concerted effort to insert the military into civilian law enforcement in a way and on a scale that has no precedent in American history,” said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program.

Trump says he has the “right” to send National Guard troops to the cities, even over the objections of state governors.

“I’m the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger — and it is in danger in these cities — I can do it,” he said recently.

A HISTORIC TEST

Congress, under its constitutional duties, has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically. But as Trump has pushed the limits of those laws, the Republican-controlled Congress has stood by. Instead, it’s been left to the courts to put any guardrails on Trump’s maximalist approach to the presidency.

A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration “willfully” broke the Posse Comitatus Act, a nearly 150-year-old federal law that limits the U.S. military’s role in domestic law enforcement, when he sent National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area in early June after days of protests over immigration raids.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco noted Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated they intend to deploy National Guard troops to other cities across the country, raising concerns they’re “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”

That sort of use of the National Guard was just what the writers of the Constitution were trying to guard against, said Andrew Wiest, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the National Guard at the University of Southern Mississippi.

The young nation had just endured a war of independence that was sparked by a British military acting as a police force on the colony, and its early leaders were reticent to give the president too much control over the military. Since then, presidents have increasingly exercised more power over the troops that started as state-based militias.

“This is another one of those pendulum moments where the Guard will become more federal or maybe it will swing back in the other direction,” Wiest said. “But since the founding of the Republic, it’s been swinging towards the federal side.”

THE GOP’S MORAL BANKRUPTCY

Despite decades of fevered rhetoric warning that an overreaching federal government might someday turn its guns on its own people, the nation’s loudest defenders of the Second Amendment — including the National Rifle Association — have met Trump’s unprecedented domestic deployment of military force not with outrage, but with resounding silence or open approval.

The same voices that have long claimed an armed citizenry is a bulwark against government tyranny are now watching, even applauding, as military vehicles roll into American cities not during natural disasters or riots, but as part of a politically driven campaign to project federal authority.

Their absence from this national moment exposes a contradiction at the core of their advocacy, the supposed fight for liberty collapses when authoritarianism aligns with their ideology.

Legal scholars and civil rights organizations have noted the chilling precedent being set, warning of a dangerous shift toward a militarized police state. Yet gun rights organizations have offered no resistance, no constitutional concern, no defense of the very citizens they claimed for decades to protect.

In choosing political loyalty over principle, they have abandoned their own stated mission and affirmed that their crusade was never about safeguarding democracy — only about enabling power.

Among those praising the use of National Guard troops on American streets are some of the Republican Party’s most vocal Second Amendment advocates — lawmakers who have received top ratings from the National Rifle Association and have long warned that unchecked federal power threatens American liberty.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-LA, a staunch NRA ally who has consistently invoked constitutional protections against government overreach, has now welcomed the federal militarization of local streets, calling the deployments “helpful.”

Senator Josh Hawley, R-MO, another lawmaker who has publicly aligned with the NRA and warned of “deep state” abuses of power, has likewise offered no opposition to Trump’s domestic military agenda.

And Senator Ted Cruz, R-TX, who once claimed gun rights exist “to protect the citizenry from the government,” has remained notably quiet as the president advances what legal experts are calling a civilian-targeted show of military force.

Such approval of domestic troop deployments stands in sharp contrast to the rhetoric that the gun rights movement has spouted for decades — framing themselves as defenders of Americans against potential tyranny.

Yet with Trump asserting unilateral power to override governors and send troops into cities without consent, their silence on constitutional checks has been deafening. Critics argue the disconnect reveals a deep moral bankruptcy. A willingness to abandon foundational principles when the abuse of government power comes from within their own party.",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090825_GOPMiltaryDeploy_01_JScottApplewhite.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 10:58:34.412491

“Harassing law enforcement to prevent them from doing their jobs is unlawful in Florida,” Uthmeier said, calling on Orange County State Attorney Worrell to investigate.
“Stop playing politics with the lives and safety of law enforcement officers.” But in an emailed statement to The Florida Phoenix, Worrell’s office said investigations are typically conducted by law enforcement, not by her staff.
That function lies with law enforcement.
To date, we have not received a criminal case package from law enforcement,” said Anika Hamilton, Worrell’s communications specialist.","Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier wants a former state senator investigated over a Facebook post in which she revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were massed at an Orlando bus station.

In an X post Monday, Uthmeier said former Sen. Linda Stewart, an Orlando Democrat, may have been “harassing law enforcement” by telling Floridians on Aug. 15 that ICE was at the Lynx Central Station in downtown Orlando.

In an interesting twist, just hours after hinting at a suspension from her post, Uthmeier asked Orange County’s Democratic state attorney, Monique Worrell, to do the investigating.

Stewart, 76, protested.

“I have done absolutely nothing wrong!” Stewart told The Florida Phoenix on a phone call, alleging that Uthmeier had not reached out to her before posting on social media. “I’m shocked. I don’t know why [Uthmeier] would do such a thing for me saying that ICE is in a public space. I didn’t go into ICE headquarters and find out all the details of where they’re going to be. … I just posted [on Facebook].”

“Big deal,” she continued, insisting that she’s not worried. “In all of their freedom of speech, I don’t know what reason they would think that that could cause me to be arrested.”

Stewart said that a friend had told her that ICE was at the station, informing her Aug. 15 Facebook post. Soon after, MAGA podcaster and right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who boasts nearly 2 million followers on X, alerted Uthmeier on social media that Stewart was allegedly “doxxing” ICE.

Doxxing involves maliciously publicizing a person’s personal information. In June, Uthmeier rolled out a new program specifically designed to protect ICE agents from being doxxed.

“Harassing law enforcement to prevent them from doing their jobs is unlawful in Florida,” Uthmeier said, calling on Orange County State Attorney Worrell to investigate. “Stop playing politics with the lives and safety of law enforcement officers.”

But in an emailed statement to The Florida Phoenix, Worrell’s office said investigations are typically conducted by law enforcement, not by her staff.

“Traditionally, our office does not conduct investigations. That function lies with law enforcement. To date, we have not received a criminal case package from law enforcement,” said Anika Hamilton, Worrell’s communications specialist. “Should one be submitted, we will review it and handle the matter in the same way we handle all other criminal cases presented to us.”

Uthmeier’s call to action came just hours after he sent a lengthy letter to Worrell, demanding she stop pressing charges against a woman accused of second-degree murder. Uthmeier, who believes the woman acted in self-defense, claimed Worrell’s prosecution could constitute an ethical violation demonstrating ground for a suspension from office.

It wouldn’t be the first time Worrell’s been suspended. In 2023, when Uthmeier served as chief of staff to Gov. Ron DeSantis, the governor removed Worrell from office for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.” Last November she won re-election to the post, defeating the DeSantis appointee who replaced her by 15 points.

“There’s just no reason for it,” Stewart said. “I can’t imagine [Worrell] saying I did anything wrong. I just don’t get it.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-14-at-11.20.56 AM-2048x1019.png,N,,2025-09-09 11:58:26.881643
