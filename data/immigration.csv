The state’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a news conference that California was joining Oregon’s lawsuit to stop the deployment of the California Guard.
Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Memphis, with varying goals of protecting federal property and fighting crime.
That’s what we intend to do.” Newsom has already clashed with the administration over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard in June in Los Angeles.
Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.","President Donald Trump’s clash with Oregon escalated after about 100 California National Guard members were deployed to the Pacific Northwest state, despite a court order holding that isolated protests in Portland did not justify the use of federalized troops.

The troops arrived Saturday night with no prior notice to state officials, and more troops are on the way, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek said in a statement Sunday.

Oregon officials said they were going to return to federal court Monday because the 14-day restraining order from US District Judge Karin Immergut only stopped the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops. The state’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a news conference that California was joining Oregon’s lawsuit to stop the deployment of the California Guard.

Troops were ordered to Illinois in a similar manner.

Rayfield and Kotek told reporters they hoped US District Judge Karin Immergut would rule Monday on their request, which is the same day the Trump administration is appealing her Saturday ruling.

“The president is trying to out-hustle us” in this process, Rayfield said.

The Trump administration has said that federalized troops are needed to protect immigration officers from protesters in Democratic-run cities, even as local officials said demonstrations have been modest and largely peaceful.

“There is no need for military intervention in Oregon,” Kotek said in the statement. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. Oregon is our home, not a military target.”

The move marks another dramatic escalation in Trump’s campaign to federalize law enforcement in Democratic cities, with his administration now trying to find ways around federal court orders. Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Memphis, with varying goals of protecting federal property and fighting crime.

Protests in Portland began in June when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents started arresting undocumented immigrants as they appeared in court for procedural hearings. The sporadic protests have focused on a single ICE facility outside downtown, a far cry from the often violent protests that rocked Portland during social-justice protests in 2020.

Nevertheless, Trump called Portland “war-ravaged” and said Sunday the city was “burning to the ground.”

Kotek countered that description on Sunday, noting that the protest was confined to one city block and that the Portland Marathon had occurred that day.

“Thousands of people running 26 miles through the streets of Portland — clearly not a war zone,” she said. “We cannot normalize the approach he is taking with the military in our country.”

The deployment of California troops to Oregon came hours after a Trump-appointed federal judge in Portland issued a strongly worded court order temporarily blocking the administration’s plan to call up 200 Oregon National Guard members to the state’s largest city.

Immergut concluded there was no justification for the deployment. She cited the limited nature of the protests and the ability of local law enforcement to handle the situation, which typically involved about 20 protesters at a time in recent weeks. The judge also said that the deployment risks “blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request to confirm the deployment, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Sunday that the federal government expects to win its appeal of the Portland judge’s order.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Jackson said. California Governor Gavin Newsom, she said, “should stand on the side of law-abiding citizens instead of violent criminals destroying Portland and cities across the country.”

Rayfield said Trump is falsely portraying Portland as a war zone to justify sending in federalized troops.

“This president is obviously hellbent on deploying the military in American cities, absent facts or authority to do so,” Rayfield said earlier in a statement. “It is up to us and the courts to hold him accountable. That’s what we intend to do.”

Newsom has already clashed with the administration over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard in June in Los Angeles.

“Despite a federal court order finding no legal basis to deploy state National Guard troops to the streets of Portland and ordering that control of the Oregon National Guard be returned to state command, the Trump administration is now sending 300 federally controlled members of the California National Guard to Portland to take their place,” Newsom said in a statement.

The judge said there were no facts to support Trump’s claims that Portland was “war-ravaged” and that anarchists and professional agitators were trying to burn down federal property and other buildings.

“The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

Immergut agreed that courts should give great deference to the president in making such decisions, but she disagreed that Trump had made his determination about Portland in good faith and ruled that deference “is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.”

Trump also ordered 300 National Guard troops to Illinois on Saturday on a similar rationale, over the objections of Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, who called the move “un-American.”

Illinois received no prior notice from the White House about the deployment, said a Pritzker spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity. The spokesperson added that the Illinois National Guard informed the Pentagon that the situation does not require the use of the military and reiterated its objection to the deployment.

The California National Guard was federalized in June for 90 days, when Trump first started using military troops to help combat what he claims is high crime and to protect federal agents carrying out his deportation actions. Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.

The Memphis deployment was conducted with the agreement of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.

Democrats are demanding a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Donald Trump and the Republicans enacted over the summer—and a renewal of a temporary boost to Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December.
It’s a cut to a Medicaid provision known commonly as “Emergency Medicaid” that reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they end up providing to undocumented immigrants.
If the administration is so opposed to illegal immigrants getting subsidized health care, would it support overturning the EMTALA requirement?
There are some morally important, politically relevant reasons behind the obligation to provide emergency treatment to undocumented immigrants—as well as for a federal program to finance that care.","WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY Karoline Leavitt on Thursday got a question she didn’t seem prepared to answer, about a law she may not have expected to be discussing.

It is known as EMTALA, which stands for the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. If you’ve ever been sitting in an emergency room, staring at the walls, you may have seen one of the posters explaining EMTALA’s guarantee: Hospitals must provide stabilizing or life-saving care to anybody who needs it, no matter who they are or whether they can pay.

The law has been on the books since the 1980s. And although EMTALA pops up in political fights from time to time, there was no reason to think it’d become a major subplot of the government shutdown story. But then the shutdown turned into an argument over health care policy.

Democrats are demanding a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Donald Trump and the Republicans enacted over the summer—and a renewal of a temporary boost to Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December. Trump and the Republicans are not inclined to take either step. And to get the public on their side, they’ve been arguing the real Democratic agenda is different—that, as Vice President JD Vance posted on X Thursday, “Democrats shut down the government to give health care money to illegal aliens.”

The problem for Republicans is that most of the Democratic demands have nothing to do with immigration, while the portion that does deals almost entirely with people here lawfully. As critics have called out the lie, Vance and his allies have retreated to a narrower argument about one tiny item on the list of cuts Democrats would reverse. It’s a cut to a Medicaid provision known commonly as “Emergency Medicaid” that reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they end up providing to undocumented immigrants.

EMTALA is the reason hospitals have to provide that care in the first place, so it was only a matter of time before Leavitt got the query she faced Thursday. If the administration is so opposed to illegal immigrants getting subsidized health care, would it support overturning the EMTALA requirement? Or, as the NBC News reporter who asked the question put it: “Should ERs check immigration status before treating a dying patient?”

“That’s probably not a question for me to answer,” Leavitt responded. “That’s a question for health care professionals and legal experts to answer.”

But it was a perfectly appropriate question for Leavitt, as it would have been for Vance or for any other Republican who used Emergency Medicaid funding as a cudgel against the Democrats last week. There are some morally important, politically relevant reasons behind the obligation to provide emergency treatment to undocumented immigrants—as well as for a federal program to finance that care.

And the best way to understand those reasons is to revisit the circumstances forty years ago that led to the creation of both.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZFCX!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6105cb7-5e4f-4c8e-aa52-7716ec7ac567_2100x1500.jpeg",N,,2025-10-05 21:56:26.853749

In other words, the idea that deportation was refused simply because of a child’s aversion to chicken nuggets was always misleading.
When it comes to interpreting the relevant ECHR articles, our courts consider guidance set out by parliament.
Over a longer time frame, it may also be possible to work with others to reform the text of the ECHR.
Leaving the ECHR would be a high-risk policy, damaging to our international standing and, at best, irrelevant in tackling illegal immigration.","Except that is not quite what happened. Evidence was put forward in the initial tribunal hearing that the father and son had a very close relationship, that the son had special needs and was emotionally fragile, and, in a long list of reasons why the boy would struggle to cope if moved to Albania, his mother mentioned that small changes to his food causes him to “seize up” and refuse to eat. A specific example was given by the mother that the boy refuses to eat the type of chicken nuggets available abroad.

• A sitting ovation for Kemi Badenoch, but they stood up for Philp

The judge in the first-tier tribunal considered the impact that either separation from his father or moving to Albania would have on the boy, set out the arguments on which he placed weight (making no explicit reference to chicken nuggets) and concluded that deportation of the father involved a breach of the son’s ECHR rights.

In other words, the idea that deportation was refused simply because of a child’s aversion to chicken nuggets was always misleading. Except even that is far from being the whole story. The Home Office appealed against the decision and won: the upper-tier tribunal rejected the conclusion that there was a breach of the boy’s Article 8 rights at all.

It was only after this second judgment was published that the so-called chicken nuggets case attracted attention as an example of how the ECHR stopped deportations — even though the case was never about chicken nuggets and, by the time it was being reported, the finding against deportation had been overturned.

When a judgment in one of these cases sounds too bad to be true, it probably isn’t true. As with the case above, a first-tier tribunal decision might be reported even though it has been overturned. A detail from the case might be presented as decisive when it was merely incidental. Another area of misleading reporting is when an argument made by the person facing deportation (or their lawyer) is quoted as being the basis of a judicial decision even if it is not.

• Russell Findlay backs Badenoch’s call to leave ECHR

A better way of assessing whether the ECHR is an impediment to an effective deportation regime is to look at the data. A recent academic study by the University of Oxford did precisely that. It found that the latest available Home Office statistics show the number of successful human rights-based appeals against deportation is very small compared with the number of foreign national offenders who are deported, at around 3.5 per cent (and some of those cases will have been overturned on appeal).

That is the evidence from the UK courts, but what about successful appeals to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg? Again, the data does not suggest that this is a serious impediment in deporting foreign national offenders. There have been 29 cases involving deportations from the UK heard by the Strasbourg court since 1980 and the UK has won 16 of them. None of the 13 defeats has been in the past five years.

We might still conclude, even though the oft-quoted cases about the problems caused by the ECHR are misleading and the data suggests this is a relatively small issue, that something must be done. It does not follow, however, that we must leave the ECHR. When it comes to interpreting the relevant ECHR articles, our courts consider guidance set out by parliament. The home secretary has set out her intention to tighten this guidance. Over a longer time frame, it may also be possible to work with others to reform the text of the ECHR.

Instead, the Conservatives have followed Reform UK into advocating full withdrawal. It is a policy that, at the very least, complicates the workings of the Good Friday agreement and our post-Brexit deal with the EU, results in us leaving the Council of Europe (following in the footsteps of Russia and Belarus), and leaves us more isolated, thereby making it harder to work with other European countries to tackle illegal immigration. Leaving the ECHR would be a high-risk policy, damaging to our international standing and, at best, irrelevant in tackling illegal immigration. That such a policy is justified by misleading and spurious claims only makes matters worse.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fad8f749f-3c01-414f-b922-7b0733d13ed6.jpg?crop=1214%2C683%2C219%2C122&resize=1200,N,,2025-10-05 19:56:32.840286

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romero with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

A future Conservative government would be open to the possibility of amending or quitting other international agreements, Badenoch said, opening the possibility of the UK leaving the UN’s 1951 refugee convention.
Leaving the ECHR was “a necessary step, but not enough on its own to achieve our goals”, she said.
“If there are other treaties and laws we need to revise or revisit, then we will do so.
The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.","A future Tory government would be open to dismantling more treaties as a means to deport people from the UK, Kemi Badenoch has said at the start of a Conservative party conference focused almost exclusively on immigration policy.

Making the first of two addresses to the gathering in Manchester, the Tory leader formally set out her proposal for the UK to quit the European convention on human rights (ECHR) as part of a wider bonfire of protections including an end to legal aid in immigration and asylum cases and the right to take migration decisions to tribunals or judicial review.

A future Conservative government would be open to the possibility of amending or quitting other international agreements, Badenoch said, opening the possibility of the UK leaving the UN’s 1951 refugee convention.

Leaving the ECHR was “a necessary step, but not enough on its own to achieve our goals”, she said. “If there are other treaties and laws we need to revise or revisit, then we will do so. And we will do so in the same calm and responsible way, working out the detail before we rush to announce.”

The plan to leave the ECHR was announced just before the conference as part of a radical and sometimes draconian package of anti-migration measures including a pledge that all asylum seekers arriving by unofficial means would be sent to their own or a third country within a week.

Another plan involves the formation of a “removals force”, billed as being modelled on Donald Trump’s semi-militarised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, with a remit to deport 150,000 people a year.

In a speech directly after Badenoch, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said that if a foreign national in the UK expressed “racial hatred, including antisemitism”, or supported “extremism or terrorism”, they would be deported.

It was not immediately clear whether this would apply only to people convicted of a crime for such actions. The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.

Unveiling the plan to leave the ECHR, Badenoch said this followed a review of the issue by Lord Wolfson, the shadow attorney general, who concluded the only feasible way to gain control of borders was to quit the treaty.

“And so to me and the shadow cabinet, the resulting policy decision is also clear,” she said. “We must leave the ECHR and repeal the Human Rights Act. Conference, I want you to know that the next Conservative manifesto will contain our commitment to leave.”

Badenoch said there would be “particular challenges in Northern Ireland”, where the ECHR is included in the Good Friday agreement. She said she would get Alex Burghart, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, “to examine this issue”.

The address contained no policies that had not been previously announced, with Badenoch repeating her mantra that the party needed to learn from its 2024 election defeat and take time to put together a cohesive platform.

“People won’t listen to us again unless we showed them we have learned from our mistakes and changed,” she said. Badenoch went on to take a swipe at Liz Truss’s mini-budget, saying: “We will never repeat the financial irresponsibility of spending commitments without saying where the money is coming from.”

Much of her conference speech and that of Philp’s were focused on migration, with the shadow home secretary in particular using large parts of his address to list a sequence of criminal offences committed by asylum seekers. “This is sick. We must do whatever it takes to end this madness,” Philp said.

He set out details of the new removals force, saying it would have twice the budget of the current system and be able to take advantage of the removal of many rights and avenues of appeal.

“Stripping away the legal obstacles, that I have described, and doubling that budget means we can remove 150,000 people a year that have no legal right to be here. That is three-quarters of a million over the course of the next parliament. This illegal immigration scandal will end.”

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that's raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,"" the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""They never brought one.”

Dixon Romero with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who'd broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

Republicans — including Johnson on Sunday — argue that negotiations about the subsidies shouldn’t happen now, as they don’t expire until the end of December.","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Sunday accused Senate Democrats of not being “serious” about negotiating an end to the government shutdown.

“They’re not serious. This is not a serious negotiation. They’re doing this to get political cover,” Johnson told NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of using the government shutdown as a ploy to help a future re-election bid.

Johnson also said that Senate Democrats are the reason the government shut down, accusing them of seeking to fund emergency health services for undocumented immigrants.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who appeared on “Meet the Press” just before Johnson, accused Republicans of being the driving force behind the ongoing government shutdown, saying that GOP leaders in Congress and President Donald Trump have gone “radio silent” in negotiations to reopen the government.

“The last time there was a conversation with Republican leadership was in the White House meeting last Monday. And unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,” Jeffries told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker.

“What we’ve seen is negotiation through deepfake videos, the House canceling votes and, of course, President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That’s not responsible behavior,” the minority leader added, pointing to AI-generated videos Trump has posted online of his political foes, including Jeffries.

Later in the interview, Jeffries responded more directly to the president’s posts that included AI-generated images and videos of the minority leader, calling them “outrageous, “unhinged” and “unreasonable.”

“The American people deserve better than lies, than attacks, than deepfake videos,” he added.

Johnson’s and Jeffries’ comments come as the federal government is set to enter the sixth day of a government shutdown on Monday because Congress has not successfully appropriated the funds to keep it open.

In a separate interview Sunday on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cast doubt on the idea that the shutdown could end soon, saying it was up to Democrats to decide on the length of the shut down.

""I think it’s just as long as the Democrats want it to go on. I mean, they’re the ones — they have the control, the controlling card right now ... It’s simply, are the Democrats going to open up the government or aren’t they?” he said when asked about how long the shutdown could drag on.

Thune also said that he hopes ""reasonable"" Senate Democrats will vote alongside Republicans this week on a GOP-backed bill to reopen the government, but didn't name any Democrats who are leaning toward that.

""There are reasonable Democrats out there who are having conversations with Republicans, and I’m hopeful those are going to yield some results,” the majority leader added.

House lawmakers were set to return to Washington this week for the first time since Sept. 19, but late Friday, Johnson canceled the votes that were set to occur this week, labeling the week a district work period instead.

Republicans and Democrats are still at a stalemate in the Senate, which held votes Friday on a Democratic-backed plan and a Republican-backed plan to temporarily fund the government. Neither plan received the 60 votes needed to move forward.

Before they left town in September, House Republicans passed a stopgap funding measure that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21. Just one House Democrat — Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine — joined his GOP colleagues in voting for that bill.

But that temporary funding bill has stalled in the Senate, where the bills have failed multiple times to clear the 60-vote threshold, with a majority of Democratic senators voting against it.

Johnson on Sunday pointed to those votes as the cause of the shutdown, telling Welker, “The reason the government is closed is because Chuck Schumer and 43 of his Democrat colleagues in the Senate have decided now to vote multiple times to keep the government closed. We need them to turn the lights back on so that everyone can do their work.”

“The House did our work,” Johnson added. “We passed a bipartisan, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open. And what did Chuck Schumer send back in response? His counterproposal would add $1.5 trillion in new spending for a simple seven-week stopgap funding measure to keep the government open.”

Senate Democrats have proposed their own temporary funding measure that would fund the government through Oct. 31. It would also restore previous GOP cuts to Medicaid and extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.

Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to give Medicaid access to undocumented immigrants — something that is already prohibited under previous laws — in that bill.

Jeffries, in his interview, accused Republicans of “lying” on that point “because they’re losing in the court of public opinion as it relates to what’s going on right now.”

He added that Democrats “are standing up for the health care of hardworking American taxpayers, of working-class Americans, of middle-class Americans and everyday Americans.”

Jeffries also said that “federal law clearly prohibits the expenditure of taxpayer dollars to provide health care to undocumented immigrants, period, full stop, and no Democrat on Capitol Hill is trying to change that law.”

Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year have been at the center of the debate over funding the government. Republicans — including Johnson on Sunday — argue that negotiations about the subsidies shouldn’t happen now, as they don’t expire until the end of December.

“We have plenty of time to figure that out, because, again, it doesn’t expire until the end of the year,” the speaker told Welker.

Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the time to negotiate on the subsidies is now, before open enrollment for health care plans begins in early November.

The two leaders also spoke about the Trump administration’s plan to conduct mass layoffs of federal workers during the government shutdown. Multiple administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance last week, have blamed Democrats for fueling the layoffs.

“In a situation like this, where the Senate Democrats have decided to turn the keys to the kingdom over to the to the White House, they have to make tough decisions. Russ Vought runs the Office of Management and Budget,” Johnson said. “He has to now look at all of the federal government, recognizing that the funding streams have been turned off, and determine what are essential programs, policies and personnel. That’s that’s not a job that he relishes, but he’s being required to do it by Chuck Schumer.”

In a separate interview later Sunday on CNN, Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett confirmed that the administration still planned to fire some furloughed federal workers.

""If the president decides that the negotiations are absolutely going nowhere, then there will be layoffs,"" Hassett said. ""I think that everybody's still hopeful that when we get a fresh start at the beginning of the week, that we can get the Democrats to see that it's just common sense to avoid layoffs like that.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251002-mike-johnson-gk-f7cade.jpg",N,,2025-10-05 16:56:48.309982

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.

A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. The court joined the four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The 14th Amendment

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily -- and by extension, their children -- cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats -- both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority -- were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

Supreme Court rulings

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Lower court decisions

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

""The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,"" Chief Judge David Barron wrote. ""It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.""

White House response

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to ""being vindicated by the Supreme Court.""

To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.",https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2025/10/05/20251005p2g00m0in030000p/0c10.jpg?1,N,,2025-10-05 20:57:12.451297

The matter of the Epstein files has for months been a thorn in the side of the president and his allies in Congress.
Another complication, both for the petition and Grijalva’s hopes to taking her seat: the House was out of session all this week.
No luck, even though Johnson administered the oath to two Republicans who won special elections in Florida during a similar session earlier this year.
“That doesn’t make sense, why I wouldn’t be sworn in, in the same pace that they were?” Grijalva said.","Congress’s newest member, Adelita Grijalva, came to Washington DC this week, expecting to be officially sworn in by the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson.

Two days later, she returned to her southern Arizona district disappointed, if not a little confused. No swearing-in ceremony had been organized, meaning Grijalva, a Democrat who easily won a special election last month to replace her late father, Raúl M Grijalva, was not able to start her new job.

Trapped in the purgatorial status of representative-elect, she had to be escorted around the Capitol building by her soon-to-be-colleagues, like any other member of the public. Her name is on the door of her new office, but she does not have the keys.

“I want to get to work and I can’t,” Grijalva said.

She thinks she knows the reason why Johnson is in no rush to administer the oath: in addition to co-sponsoring bills on the environment, public education and other issues she campaigned on addressing, Grijalva plans to provide the final signature on a petition that would force a vote on legislation to release files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein – which the speaker and Donald Trump oppose.

“I can’t think of any other reason. It’s not like my being sworn in changes the majority,” she said.

The matter of the Epstein files has for months been a thorn in the side of the president and his allies in Congress. Though Trump has decried it as a “Democrat hoax”, a small group of dissident Republicans have joined with all of the Democrats in the House of Representatives to pursue the legislative maneuver, known as a discharge petition. It just needs the signatures of 218 lawmakers to succeed, and has currently received 217 – Grijalva’s would be the last one.

The petition is a rare instance of defiance among congressional Republicans, who have given Trump much of what he wants ever since he returned to the White House. But even if it succeeds and the legislation passes the House, it is unlikely to go far. The Senate’s Republican leaders have shown little interest in the issue, and it is difficult to imagine Trump signing the bill.

Another complication, both for the petition and Grijalva’s hopes to taking her seat: the House was out of session all this week. Johnson last month called off planned work days to pressure Senate Democrats into voting for legislation the chamber has approved to fund the government and end the ongoing shutdown.

However, the House did hold a three-and-a-half-minute procedural session on Tuesday – one Grijalva attended along with dozens of Democrats, in hopes of getting Johnson to swear her in. No luck, even though Johnson administered the oath to two Republicans who won special elections in Florida during a similar session earlier this year.

“That doesn’t make sense, why I wouldn’t be sworn in, in the same pace that they were?” Grijalva said. “And who is losing out are the constituents that need a Congress to work for them.”

A spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his comments signaling that Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, but that will not happen until funding is restored to the government.

“The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government,” Johnson said today, referring to the top Senate Democrat whom the Republicans blame for the funding lapse.

Grijalva along with her family had planned to be in Washington again by Tuesday of next week, in hopes the House would be back to work. On Friday afternoon, Johnson announced that it would take the whole week off.

“Now I have to change, blow up all of the travel plans that I made for everybody,” she said. “So, that’s frustrating.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945f4aefad55a59385ab8763cbadd1182cfcd379/222_0_6266_5013/master/6266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae1984b8d2ab36d709613ed54d9ec317",N,,2025-10-05 15:57:42.534036

According to Badenoch, the Removals Force will have a mandate to remove all illegal entrants, foreign criminals, and undocumented migrants, while also monitoring illegal work.
Instead, in just a year, they delivered record small boat crossings, over 50,000 illegal arrivals, 32,000 people in asylum hotels, billions wasted.
Badenoch’s announcement has intensified the ongoing debate in the UK over immigration policy, balancing border security with human rights considerations.
Critics have expressed concern over the repeal of the Human Rights Act and the use of facial recognition technology without oversight, while supporters have welcomed the proposed measures as a decisive step in tackling illegal immigration.","Kemi Badenoch, leader of the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party, has unveiled an aggressive immigration reform plan aimed at detaining and deporting 150,000 illegal migrants annually, in what she described as the “toughest reforms Britain has ever seen” in border policy. The announcement was made in a video message posted on her X account on Sunday.

The plan, dubbed the Radical Borders Plan, envisages the establishment of a new Removals Force modelled after the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which would replace the current Home Office Immigration Enforcement unit. According to Badenoch, the Removals Force will have a mandate to remove all illegal entrants, foreign criminals, and undocumented migrants, while also monitoring illegal work. She stated, “My message is clear: if you’re here illegally, you will be detained and deported.”

Badenoch sharply criticised previous administrations, accusing both Conservative and Labour governments of failing to manage the migration crisis effectively. “Successive governments have failed on immigration. Labour promised to smash the gangs. Instead, in just a year, they delivered record small boat crossings, over 50,000 illegal arrivals, 32,000 people in asylum hotels, billions wasted. It’s pure weakness. Britain needs a serious, credible plan and the backbone to deliver it,” she said.

The proposed plan includes several controversial measures. Asylum claims from illegal entrants would be banned, the Human Rights Act repealed, and the United Kingdom withdrawn from the European Convention on Human Rights. Badenoch added that all new illegal arrivals would be deported within a week, with legal obstacles to mass removals removed and visa sanctions imposed on countries that refuse to repatriate their citizens. She also pledged to “shut down the asylum hotel racket,” which she said would save taxpayers billions and restore public confidence in the UK’s border controls.

The Removals Force, if approved, will operate with an annual budget of £1.6 billion, double that of the current Immigration Enforcement unit, funded by savings from the closure of asylum hotels and other measures within the asylum system. The force will have sweeping powers, including the use of facial recognition technology without prior warning, and will integrate closely with the police. Priority for removals will include new illegal entrants, foreign criminals, failed asylum seekers, visa over-stayers, and others identified as residing in the UK illegally.

In an interview on BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Badenoch faced criticism for her refusal to specify the destinations to which deported migrants would be sent. She responded, “I’m tired of all of these irrelevant questions about where they should go. They will go back to where they should be or another country, but they should not be here.” When pressed further, she added, “They will go back to where they came from.”

According to the Conservative Party document detailing the plan, the proposed measures are intended to increase removals from the current 34,000 per year to approximately 150,000, marking a five-fold increase in enforcement activity. The party argues that the reforms are necessary to address what it describes as uncontrolled migration and to strengthen public trust in the country’s border system.

Badenoch’s announcement has intensified the ongoing debate in the UK over immigration policy, balancing border security with human rights considerations. Critics have expressed concern over the repeal of the Human Rights Act and the use of facial recognition technology without oversight, while supporters have welcomed the proposed measures as a decisive step in tackling illegal immigration.

Poilievre said law enforcement officials are still able to do searches — including searching mail — but they need a warrant to do so.
In a minority Parliament, the Liberals need votes from at least one other party to pass legislation.

""We've told Liberals that their current Bill C-2 will not pass unless they remove the violations of Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy,"" Poilievre said in an interview with CBC News.

""We don't think that law-abiding Canadians should lose their liberty to pay for the failures of the Liberals on borders and immigration.""

The Strong Borders Act, known as C-2, is a marquee piece of Liberal government legislation, introduced in the spring sitting in part as an effort to persuade the Trump administration that its concerns about border security — used to justify tariffs — were unwarranted.

Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon has said it's about ""ensuring law enforcement has the tools to keep our border secure,"" but civil rights groups and privacy experts criticized it, saying some provisions appear to go far beyond the stated aims of the legislation.

The 140-page proposed law includes sweeping powers for security and intelligence services, including expanding the ability to open and inspect mail and allowing officials to cancel or suspend immigration documents.

Bill C-2 also proposes giving police the ability to demand subscriber information from internet providers and other online companies — which could amount to law enforcement asking an internet company about a customer's online activity without a warrant.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has said such information provides ""a trove of background about our lives"" and questioned whether such a bill is compliant with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Conservatives had previously expressed concerns about ""snooping provisions"" in the bill, and on Friday, Poilievre confirmed his party will not support the existing bill and called on the Liberals to introduce a new piece of legislation.

""We've said to them that there's no way they're going to be able to pass their current bill, C-2, which attacks the freedoms and the privacy of Canadians,"" he said.

""They should reintroduce a new bill that focuses on law breakers, on restoring order at the border, on kicking out fraudulent refugees, while at the same time allowing people to send mail, use the internet or do legitimate lawful cash transactions.""

Poilievre said law enforcement officials are still able to do searches — including searching mail — but they need a warrant to do so.

""Mail is the easiest thing to get a warrant for. If you suspect there's something suspicious in a parcel or envelope, you set it aside, you go to a judge and you get a warrant. The envelope or parcel is not going to grow legs and run away,"" he said.

In a minority Parliament, the Liberals need votes from at least one other party to pass legislation. The New Democrats, the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party have expressed similar concerns about government overreach.

U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to not detain any child who came to the country alone and without permission in ICE adult detention facilities after they become an adult.

The Washington, D.C., judge found that such automatic detention violates a court order he issued in 2021 barring such practices.

ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond Saturday to emails seeking comment.

The push to detain new adults is yet another battle over one of the most sensitive issues in President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda — how to treat children who cross the border unaccompanied by adults.

The Associated Press reported Friday that officials are offering migrant children age 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. Last month a separate federal judge blocked attempts to immediately deport Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country. Some children had been put on board planes in that late-night operation before a judge blocked it.

“All of these are pieces of the same general policy to coerce immigrant youth into giving up their right to seek protection in the United States,” said Michelle Lapointe, a lawyer for the American Immigration Council, one of the groups that asked Contreras to intervene in a filing made just after midnight Saturday.

Unaccompanied children are held in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, under not ICE but the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Contreras’ 2021 order instructed federal officials to release minors who turn 18 from those shelters to “the least restrictive setting available.” He ruled that is what is required by federal law as long as the minor isn’t a danger to themselves or others and isn’t a flight risk. Minors are often released to the custody of a relative, or maybe into foster care.

But lawyers who represent unaccompanied minors said they began getting word in the last few days that ICE was telling shelters that children who were about to turn 18 — even those who had already-approved release plans — could no longer be released and would instead be taken to detention facilities, possibly as early as Saturday. One email from ICE asserted that the new adults could only be released by ICE under its case-by-case parole authority for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit.” From March through September, ICE has paroled fewer than 500 people overall.

The plaintiffs argued that “release on parole is all but a dead letter” and that children aging out of shelters would experience lasting harm from “unnecessary and inappropriate adult detention” in jails that might be overcrowded or in remote locations. The plaintiffs said that was especially true because some of the clients they cited had been victims of trafficking or had been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents.

U.S. border authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021. A 2008 law requires them to appear before an immigration judge before being returned to their countries.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters since the Trump administration put them under closer scrutiny before releasing them to family in the United States to pursue their immigration cases.

The additional scrutiny includes fingerprinting, DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers. Over the summer, immigration officers started showing up and arresting parents.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d210b0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3078+0+148/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F3f%2F9f%2Fce064532b019755ea8dfafcc7239%2F162bdd7bbd394aabac1a8f53ab8e12d3,N,,2025-10-05 15:57:51.453154

Even if she steadies her position, the next general election could be as far off as 2029, making Ms. Badenoch unlikely to reach Downing Street any time soon.

The announcement reflects a hardening stance on migration and other issues in Britain, where the political debate has been influenced both by Nigel Farage, the leader of a populist anti-immigration party, Reform U.K., and by the policies of President Trump.

The woman, a U.S. citizen identified as Marimar Martinez, was armed with a “semi-automatic weapon” and drove herself to the hospital for treatment after being shot on Saturday, Oct. 4, according to the Department of Homeland Security. She was discharged and taken into custody by the FBI.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for DHS, said in a statement the woman was named in an intelligence bulletin last week for allegedly ""doxing agents."" Another person accused of ramming into ICE vehicles, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, has also been taken into custody in Chicago.

The incident broke out in Broadview, a suburb west of the city that has become a flashpoint for protests against heightened immigration enforcement. Several protesters were arrested over the weekend and multiple Border Patrol agents were sent to the hospital after clashes outside the Broadview ICE facility, according to DHS.

Protests escalate amid Trump's heightened deportation campaign

Chicago has seen large-scale raids involving helicopters and masked agents since last month, when the White House ordered an immigration crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz. More than 800 people have been arrested, according to federal tallies.

For weeks, hundreds have protested outside an ICE facility in Broadview, with protesters blocking ICE vehicles and federal agents deploying pepper spray, tear gas and non-lethal ammunition.

After DHS agents fired at Martinez, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem vowed to send reinforcements and special operations to the scene.

Trump plans to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Chicago

On Saturday, Oct. 4, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker warned that President Donald Trump’s administration plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.

“Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker wrote on X. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

Trump has deployed National Guard troops to other Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles and Washington, moves that are being challenged in court.

Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants.","For months, as Donald Trump has used the levers of the US federal government to consolidate power, silence dissent and punish his political enemies, Democrats have been bombarded with a single demand: do something. Last week, they did.

In a rare display of unity, out-of-power Democrats embraced the risky politics of a government shutdown – their boldest effort yet to rein in a president whom many Americans and constitutional scholars now view as a threat to US democracy.

“It’s not a fight for fighting’s sake,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the outside groups closely coordinating with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. “This is a battle about Donald Trump’s attacks on the constitution and him seizing the power over all spending from Congress – and whether Congress is going to let him get away with that.”

Washington is bracing for what could be an extended government shutdown, which officially began at 12.01am on Wednesday. Last week, Senate Democrats repeatedly blocked a Republican funding measure to reopen the government, as the parties traded blame and each side insisted they would not bend to the other’s demands.

Democrats are pressing for an array of healthcare-centered priorities, including the extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans set to expire at the end of the year. The White House and Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have refused to include any healthcare concessions as part of a deal to reopen the government, though some GOP lawmakers are open to extending the ACA subsidies.

Democrats, with little leverage and deep skepticism that Republicans will honor any future deal, view the shutdown as their only option to force the issue.

But the Trump administration is working to make the closures as painful as possible for Democrats, who Republicans accuse of trying to “sabotage” the president’s agenda.

Trump has called the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to dismantle federal programs and what he called “Democrat agencies”. In a sharp break from precedent, the Trump administration is readying plans to permanently layoffs of federal workers while it takes punitive action against Democratic-led states. Several government departments have posted partisan and potentially illegal messages saying their operations are curtailed due to “the Radical Left Democrat shutdown”. In the Senate, the majority leader John Thune has said he plans to hold more votes on a plan to reopen the government this week.

But Democrats say the stakes are too high – and the greater risk is capitulating to the president.

“Remember, right now, our healthcare system is broken. Right now, we’re the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,” the senator Bernie Sanders said in a video with progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, explaining the Democrats’ opposition to the Republican funding bill. “And these guys want to make it even worse. We’re not going to let that happen.”

Progressive activists who have been sharply critical of the party’s congressional leaders, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, are now praising them for continuing to “hold the line on healthcare”.

“What our members see is Democrats willing to stand up and fight,” said Joel Payne, a spokesperson for MoveOn, which is part of a coalition of progressive groups flooding Democrats with calls to hold fast in shutdown negotiations.

Payne said healthcare was Democrats’ “north star” – the party’s strongest issue with voters and one that has helped propel them to victory in the past. If Democrats are successful, he added, the showdown over healthcare could serve as a blueprint for safeguarding other rights under attack by the administration.

House Republicans did not need Democrats to pass their short-term spending bill last month, which would fund the government mostly at current levels through 21 November. But in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, they need Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation.

So far, only three members of the Senate Democratic caucus have broken ranks: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King, an independent of Maine.

In the House, Maine congressman Jared Golden, was only House Democrat to back the Republican funding bill when it passed the House last month. In a statement last week, Golden said the shutdown was the “result of hardball politics” driven by the demands of “far-left groups” eager to show their opposition to Trump.

Early polling suggests voters are more inclined to blame Trump and Republicans than Democrats for the federal shutdown. A Washington Post poll released on Thursday found that, by a 17-percentage-point margin, Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown. Independents overwhelmingly sided with Democrats, the survey found.

Yet there were signs public opinion could shift as more Americans face the ripple effects of government-wide closures. In several polls, a significant share of voters said they held both parties equally responsible or were unsure of whom to blame.

The call for Democrats to take a harder line against Trump has been building for months. Across the country, progressive activists, disaffected Republicans and voters outraged by the administration’s actions have packed town halls, marched in protests and launched campaigns of their own – sending a clear message to Democrats: step up, or step aside.

“Everybody wants a fighter,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice-president at the centrist thinktank Third Way that is often at odds with the party’s left flank.

Erickson said the focus on healthcare – an issue that unifies the party’s diverse coalition and falls squarely in the “Venn diagram of things voters care about” – was both good politics and good policy.

“The ACA subsidies are a real ask,” she said. “If Democrats got that, it would be a way to declare victory in this moment.”

Democrats feel confident going to battle over healthcare. A Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll showed that 78% of Americans support extending the credits, which disproportionately benefit Republican-held congressional districts.

Without action, insurance premiums for millions of Americans could double next year, according to an analysis by KFF. Democrats have also sought to reverse Medicaid cuts included in Trump’s marquee tax-and-immigration package, which the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects will leave 10 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade.

Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants. The White House has taunted Democrats with a deepfake video of Schumer and Jeffries, wearing a sombrero and fake mustache that has been widely denounced as racist. Vance laughed off the criticism, calling the video “funny”.

Democrats like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, fired back with memes and taunts of their own. In one tweet, Newsom’s press team posted an AI generated image of Trump in a towering wig and an 18th-century gown: TRUMP “MARIE ANTOINETTE” SAYS, “NO HEALTH CARE FOR YOU PEASANTS, BUT A BALLROOM FOR THE QUEEN!”

Democrats are betting that the shutdown strategy can help shift momentum heading into next year’s midterm elections. By wielding their most powerful legislative tool, party leaders aim to rebuild trust with their disillusioned base – a group whose frustration has dragged Democratic approval ratings to decade lows and hurt fundraising.

Many Democrats argue that their best hope of restraining Trump is to regain the House in 2026, and that the most straightforward path to doing so is to focus on kitchen-table issues like healthcare.

Some Democratic strategists warn that by focusing primarily on healthcare, the party risks downplaying what many view as Trump’s authoritarian lurch – reducing it to just another policy showdown in Washington’s partisan budget battles.

Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic strategist and communications researcher, believes a sharper message – such as “we will not fund fascism” or “no dollars for dictatorship” – would help cut through the noise and clarify the stakes.

“In order for people to fight this regime, they have to understand it as a regime hellbent on taking our freedoms,” she said.

As part of their demands, Democrats are also pushing for ways to curtail Trump’s ability to rescind funding already approved by Congress, as he has done with foreign aid programs and public broadcasting. An alternative short-term funding bill offered by Democrats included provisions that would make it harder for the president to undermine Congress’s funding power.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible and a leading voice on the left pushing Democrats to fight harder against what he calls the Trump “regime”, said he was encouraged to see the party’s leadership sharpen its tactics. Though Levin shares the view that the stakes are far bigger than a healthcare policy dispute, he believes Democrats’ demands, if met, could “constrain the regime in some meaningful ways”.

Indivisible is helping to coordinate a second wave of No Kings rallies across the country to protest what organizers described as Trump’s “authoritarian power grab”. The day of action, planned for 18 October, will be another opportunity to mobilize Americans and, Levin hopes, to celebrate Democrats for their resolve.

“I hope what we will not be doing is criticizing them for having surrendered again,” he said. “So the play is to win.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a0a19273693e8b73b5c00423004d7f34a026dd/81_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96af3544967124b8c341f2dffa705562",N,,2025-10-05 13:57:01.925731

This is a white supremist organization that’s seeking to terrorize Black and Brown people in the city of Chicago.”","(NewsNation) — A Chicago alderperson who was handcuffed by federal immigration authorities while inquiring about a man who was injured during a foot chase with agents says the experience demonstrates how the Trump administration is sowing fear and chaos across the city.

Ald. Jessie Fuentes said she was asking feds at the hospital Friday if they had a signed warrant for the undocumented individual they were after. Agents spun her around and handcuffed her, according to video posted to the Citizen App. She was quickly released, Fuentes said, but was warned not to try to re-enter the hospital.

“In the hospital, there are patients, there are staff that did not feel safe, and they called me to find out why ICE was in the hospital,” said Fuentes, referring to officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Now, as the alderperson of the 26th Ward, I have a moral obligation to protect the residents that live in my ward.”

Fuentes said her brush with ICE is just one example of how the feds under the Trump administration are riding roughshod over people since the Department of Homeland Security sent a surge of resources to Chicago to enforce immigration laws. She argues relatively few migrants caught up in the dragnet have criminal records, and even U.S. citizens are being swept up because of their appearance.

“There are U.S. citizens who are contractors, laborers, in the city of Chicago that are being detained because they’re Brown and they speak Spanish,” Fuentes told “NewsNation Prime” on Saturday. “This is not about making our community safe. This is a white supremist organization that’s seeking to terrorize Black and Brown people in the city of Chicago.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/citizen.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-05 15:57:56.898648

Pritzker said this past week, ""ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White.

After passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.
I asked Acton, ""Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?""","It's 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday in the heart of Hollywood, and the service at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is just getting underway. It was worship via the web. The church itself was empty, just like during the pandemic, when parishioners feared catching COVID. Today it was empty because they fear being caught themselves.

On June 6, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement descended on Ambiance Apparel, a clothing wholesaler in L.A.'s Fashion District. The pastor of St. Stephen's, Father Jaime Edwards Acton, whose congregation is about 80% Hispanic, got a frantic call: ""She said, 'They got 'em.' At first, I had no idea what she was talking about because I was not thinking about it,"" Acton said. ""Even with all the threats and the bravado and stuff, I was not thinking that it would happen directly to us.""

Thirteen members of his congregation were arrested that day. The Trump Administration no longer considers schools, hospitals and churches to be ""protected sensitive locations"" anymore. So, the following Sunday, Acton told his faithful to stay away.

He says the decision to close the church was not made lightly: ""No, not at all, but I was trying to balance, could we do church in person knowing that a good portion of our community was too afraid to leave their homes? It wasn't even people that were undocumented. I have longtime parishioners that I know for sure are citizens and have been for a while that were afraid to leave. They were afraid to leave their homes.""

In Los Angeles, that fear turned to anger, and anger into violence. The raids were challenged in court for being indiscriminate and based on skin color, but ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the raids could continue.

Since then, in city after city, the administration has been testing the court's limits, especially in Chicago. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said this past week, ""ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States. Now ICE is making it commonplace.""

Pritzker said Saturday the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. Pritzker said Mr. Trump gave him an ultimatum: ""Call up your troops, or we will.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has long defended the ICE raids as only going after the ""worst of the worst.""

""Nobody is getting swept up,"" Noem said on August 8. ""We're running targeted enforcement operations across the country.""

But as those operations increased, so have assaults on federal agents: a sniper attack on an ICE facility in Dallas; an ambush in Alvarado, Texas; a violent scuffle in San Francisco.

And then there is Portland. Protests around the ICE headquarters there have sparked particular ire from President Donald Trump, who directed federal troops to be sent to what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called a ""war-ravaged city."" [On Saturday a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland.]

In fact, this past week, while addressing top military brass, the president suggested American cities could serve as ""training grounds"" for U.S. combat troops. ""It seems that the ones that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And we're gonna straighten 'em out one by one. And this is gonna be a major part for some of the people in this room.""

""This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore""

That idea has some military commanders uneasy, and even civilians within ICE itself are finding themselves conflicted.

As part of ICE's legal department, attorney Adam Boyd provided guidance related to how ICE officers performed their enforcement duties. ""I saw this push to find how can we accomplish the goal with anything that seems legal enough,"" he said. ""We're lumping people with no criminal history who have been here for a very long time with the 'worst of the worst.'

""There's no question we have threats in our country,"" Boyd said. ""That's why the State Department and Homeland Security and the FBI and all these agencies work together to keep people safe. This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore. It feels like we're just hitting numbers and goals.""

Take the case of 20-year-old Dylan Contreras, who came into the U.S. from Venezuela under a Biden-era mobile app. Back in April, though, DHS began revoking the legal status of many of those who used that app to apply for asylum.

While his case was pending, Contreras had been attending high school in the Bronx learning English, and working as a delivery driver, in order to get his mom, Raiza, and his two younger siblings – Helen, 10 and Caleb, 7 – out of a shelter.

Last May, Contreras did what he was required to: he showed up for his court hearing in New York. His mother said they assumed it was just another routine hearing in the process. ""Yes, I didn't think anything bad would happen,"" she said through an interpreter. ""He wanted to enter legally; he didn't want to get into trouble. He did it the right way.""

As they left the courtroom, however, his mother says federal agents followed them into the elevator. ""Like, five people or something came at me and grabbed me, pushed me to the floor,"" she said. ""My son screamed, and they grabbed him, too, and put handcuffs on him.""

Contreras did not have a criminal record. ""Not at all, not at all,"" his mother said. ""Those who know him, know.""

His case for asylum was denied last month. Pending an appeal, Contreras will be deported, leaving his mother and his two young siblings behind. Raiza said she was ""Devastated, devastated, because I've always been with my children, and he's been my partner. He's always been more than a son, a friend, everything.""

The most recent ICE data shows those with no criminal record, like Contreras, now make up the bulk of those being arrested and detained.

The Department of Homeland Security, however, is quick to list the violent offenders who have been captured, and there are many.

As for Adam Boyd? Back in May he resigned his position at ICE citing ""unforeseen circumstances.""

""It was a difficult decision,"" he said. ""If you think something is wrong, then you have to recognize that.""

He's now working for a firm in Philadelphia defending those arrested by ICE, which is no small task. After passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Fr. Jaimie Edwards Acton says the expansion of ICE should be seen as a warning: ""I would tell everybody who thinks that this would never happen to them, that it could happen to them,"" he said. ""And people need to be ready for it, and to think through the possible, you know, kind of responses to it.""

For Acton, that response is no more hiding. For any immigrant, legal or otherwise, this is the new reality.

So, for those willing to come back, the St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is open again, with eyes out for ICE, while they pray for peace and understanding.

I asked Acton, ""Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?""

""Yeah,"" said Acton, ""but, you know, David won that one!""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/04/e7da5ee7-85c8-4302-a1b2-728f70d17f14/thumbnail/1200x630/895dbf664fec70ae6389f37be0e51593/ice-agents-1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:57:17.883086

White Sands National Park Because of the shutdown, New Mexico’s White Sands National Park will be closed “until further notice,” according to the park’s website.
Under the National Park Service contingency plan, open-air memorials and monuments like the National Mall also generally will remain accessible to the public.","Mr. Pritzker singled out a late-night Border Patrol raid last week at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side, when video taken by bystanders showed residents of the building restrained with zip ties.

Federal agents were “just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Mr. Pritzker said. He added: “They are the ones that are making it a war zone. They need to get out of Chicago if they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they were going to do.”

Mr. Pritzker suggested that the Trump administration, which planned to send 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, is intentionally heightening tensions. The administration wants to “create the war zone so they can send in even more troops,” he said.

Mr. Pritzker said he had directed state agencies to investigate what happened at the apartment building, citing reports of “children who were zip tied and held, some of them nearly naked” and “elderly people being thrown into a U-Haul for three hours and detained.” Mr. Pritzker added he believed that some of the people were U.S. citizens.

“What kind of a country are we living in?” he said.

The governor also said he wanted to know more about an episode in Chicago on Saturday when a federal agent shot and wounded a motorist who, according to federal officials, had rammed and boxed-in a law enforcement vehicle.

“It’s really hard to know exactly what the facts are, and they won’t let us access the facts,” he said. “They are just putting out their propaganda. And then we’ve got to later determine what actually happened.”

Asked whether the two-year-old war was over, Mr. Rubio responded: “Well not yet. There’s some work remains to be done.” He went on to say that Hamas had “agreed to the president’s hostage release framework.”

Mr. Rubio spoke a day before a new round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, conducted through mediators, was expected to begin in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Ron Dermer, a close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, will lead Israel’s delegation. Hamas officials did not respond to requests for comment on who would attend from their side.

The Cairo talks are expected to focus on swapping the remaining hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners — one component in the sweeping proposal released by Mr. Trump last week. Mr. Rubio suggested that this focus would leave negotiations on other formidable obstacles to ending the war until a later stage.

Israel believes that about 20 living hostages still remain in Gaza, as well as the bodies of at least 25 others. It is unclear whether Hamas would free the hostages before concluding the rest of an agreement to end the war as it views the captives as the most significant leverage it has with Israel.

Mr. Trump’s proposal demands that Hamas return all of the surviving captives and the bodies in its possession within 72 hours of Israel agreeing to the cease-fire.

“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST,” Mr. Trump said in a post on social media on Saturday.

The president’s plan envisions the creation of a Palestinian government supervised by an international “Board of Peace” led by Mr. Trump as chairman and a postwar security force drawn from foreign countries, as well as the disarming of Hamas.

Under the plan, the hostages will be swapped for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences in prison and 1,700 Gazans jailed by Israel during the war. Israel will also hand over the bodies of 15 Gazans for each dead Israeli.

Mr. Netanyahu has said he supports the proposal. Hamas officials have expressed significant reservations about some of the terms, in particular about surrendering their weapons. But even the first step of exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli pullback within Gaza will likely present difficulties, analysts say.

Both Israeli and Hamas officials say that the Palestinian group might need more time. Some living captives are believed to be held deep underground, while the bodies of others will need to be located and dug up.

Another potential sticking point to a deal will be how far Israeli forces commit to withdrawing from their current positions within Gaza.

In previous talks, Hamas had agreed for Israeli troops to withdraw to a buffer zone close to the enclave’s borders. But the lines proposed by Mr. Trump would leave Israeli forces deployed far deeper in Gaza, which Hamas could object to.

Israel and Hamas will likely disagree over the list of names of Palestinian prisoners to be released, who include many jailed for attacks on Israeli civilians. In the past, Hamas officials have indicated they would demand the release of senior Palestinian leaders jailed by Israel such as Marwan Barghouti — which Israel would likely oppose.

Israel and Hamas have now fought for two years since Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war and killed about 1,200 people. The Israeli campaign has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza — including thousands of children — according to local health officials.

The war has devastated the Gaza Strip, whose two million Palestinian residents have lived through constant fear, widespread hunger and bombardment. Human rights groups and a U.N. commission have accused Israel of genocide; the Israeli government says it is fighting Hamas, not Palestinian civilians.

The warring sides agreed to two short-lived cease-fires that saw more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages freed in exchange for more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners. Israel ended the last truce in mid-March, citing a deadlock in talks on a comprehensive cease-fire.

Israel and Hamas do not speak directly, instead relying on Qatari and Egyptian mediators to act as go-betweens, ferrying messages back and forth.

“As a general rule, if a facility or area is locked or secured during nonbusiness hours (buildings, gated parking lots, etc.) it should be locked or secured for the duration of the shutdown,” a contingency plan posted online by the Interior Department states.

Roughly two-thirds of the employees at the National Park Service, which is already facing a steep staffing shortage, have been furloughed during the shutdown, according to the plan. How much the remaining crew members will be able to do involving essential functions like law enforcement, emergency services and wildfire monitoring is unclear.

While not a comprehensive list, here is a rundown among prominent destinations of what is open, what is not and what is limited while the shutdown persists.

California National Parks

California’s nine national parks, the most of any state in the country, broadly remain open to visitors, according to the parks’ websites. But services will be limited, and some facilities, including Black Rock Nature Center in Joshua Tree National Park, will be closed.

Elsewhere in the state, local media reported that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, home to the infamous former federal prison of the same name, reopened last week after briefly closing at the start of the shutdown. And Muir Woods, a national monument near San Francisco famed for its redwood trees, will be closed, according to its website.

Utah National Parks

According to the Utah Office of Tourism website, the state’s five national parks — Zion, Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon — will remain open during the shutdown, with visitor centers at each park either open now or slated to open this weekend.

Colorado National Parks

The eight National Park Service sites in Colorado that collect fees — including Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Parks — will continue to operate using fee revenues until that funding runs out, the state’s governor, Jared Polis, said in a statement. State agencies are working with National Park Service leaders to keep those parks open, and county sheriffs in the state have also offered to support law enforcement at national park sites during the shutdown, Mr. Polis’s office said.

Underground attractions

The caves in Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico will be closed for the duration of the shutdown, as will all roads into the park, according to a post on the park’s Facebook page. Under the Interior Department contingency plan, guided tours of other cave systems, including those in Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, likely will be limited or suspended.

Grand Canyon National Park

Arizona’s most famous National Park will remain open to the public during the shutdown, but it will not collect entrance fees, according to the Grand Canyon Conservancy. Buildings on the site that are operated by the National Park Service, such as visitor centers, will be closed, the group said.

Elsewhere in the state, Petrified Forest National Park, which typically closes overnight, will likely be inaccessible for the duration of the shutdown under the Interior Department’s contingency plan.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park

The country’s most visited National Park will remain open, according to a news release from Sevier County, Tenn., which encompasses a section of the park. Under a joint plan formed by several state and local agencies and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, areas that closed at the start of the shutdown will reopen. Staff members will be on duty to clean restrooms, as well as protect visitors and wildlife, according to the statement.

Acadia National Park

In a news release on Wednesday, Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that Acadia National Park would remain “mostly open” during the shutdown, with essential visitor services intact. Local media reported on Thursday that the road to Cadillac Mountain, the park’s highest peak, which offers sweeping views of the Maine coastline, had reopened after briefly closing at the start of the shutdown.

White Sands National Park

Because of the shutdown, New Mexico’s White Sands National Park will be closed “until further notice,” according to the park’s website.

Washington, D.C., Museums and Attractions

Most museums and monuments in D.C. remain open, but more could begin to close if the shutdown continues, according to Destination DC, a nonprofit that promotes tourism in the nation’s capital. Sites that have already closed include the Library of Congress, the National Archives Museum, the Washington Monument and the National Arboretum, according to the site. Tours of the Capitol Building and the Pentagon are also suspended.

Sites run by the Smithsonian Institution — including galleries and museums across D.C. and the National Zoo — will remain open through Oct. 11, the institution said in a statement. Under the National Park Service contingency plan, open-air memorials and monuments like the National Mall also generally will remain accessible to the public.

In her ruling, Judge Immergut wrote that she expected a trial court to agree with the state’s contention that the president exceeded his constitutional authority in mobilizing federal troops for local work and likely violated the 10th Amendment.

The soldiers have been training on the Oregon coast and were expected to be in place by the weekend, though federal officials have not said what duties they would perform beyond assisting ICE.

The restraining order expires in two weeks. During that time, the judge is expected to rule on a request for a longer injunction against the deployment. Federal lawyers have appealed the restraining order, which is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Oregon and Portland that accuses the president of violating his constitutional authority.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman said. “We expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

The decision comes as the president pushes to deploy the National Guard in several major U.S. cities to combat crime and support immigration enforcement. On Saturday, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said that Mr. Trump planned to send 300 Guard troops to Chicago soon.

Before the judge’s ruling, Oregon National Guard troops were not the only Guard troops who were on the cusp of deploying in the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said he was told by the federal government that, against his wishes, California National Guard troops who had been deployed in Los Angeles under federal orders were going to be sent to Oregon to help train troops there, according to a state official close to the governor who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation.

During almost two hours of arguments Friday, lawyers for Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, contended that the president did not have the authority to use the National Guard at the ICE facility and warned that the arrival of federal forces would lead to greater violence.

State and city attorneys described Mr. Trump’s selection of Portland for deployment as “at best, arbitrary, and at worst, a politically motivated retaliation for the adoption of policies” that the president viewed as too liberal.

The president’s actions “represent one of the most dramatic infringements on state sovereignty in Oregon’s history,” Scott Kennedy, an attorney for Oregon said in court. “They radically reshape the balance of federal-state power,”

State lawyers also questioned the timing of Mr. Trump’s decision, noting records from the Portland Police Bureau that showed the size of the nightly demonstrations had dwindled before the president posted on his social media website last Saturday that he planned to ask the Department of Defense to use federal troops to “protect” Portland.

Portland Police commanders checked in with ICE officials every evening, according to records they filed in support of the temporary restraining order, and for several weeks prior to the president’s declaration, ICE employees reported that things were relatively quiet and that they did not need help.

Judge Immergut, who was appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term, agreed that the timing of the president’s order did not meet the legal standard for calling in the National Guard, saying the state provided “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the President’s directive.”

Mr. Kennedy also said the situation in Portland did not meet the standard required for mobilization of federal soldiers for domestic work; the law allows federal troops to be used domestically in times of foreign invasion, rebellion or when normal law enforcement efforts are not capable of maintaining order.

Federal lawyers contended that the protests in Portland constituted both a potential rebellion and a law enforcement challenge beyond what federal officers on the ground could handle. But Mr. Kennedy said the federal government was defining “rebellion” so broadly it could include any political demonstrations or “opposition to its authority.”

Judge Immergut agreed, writing that the federal government had shown evidence of “sporadic violence” but not “any evidence demonstrating that those episodes of violence were part of an organized attempt to overthrow the government as a whole.”

Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department lawyer, told the judge the decision to use National Guard soldiers was prompted by the Sept. 24 shooting that killed two detainees at a Dallas ICE facility and months of demonstrations in Portland that have left federal employees frightened and exhausted.

“Violent and cruel radicals have laid siege,” he said. “The evidence we have submitted at least reflects a danger of a rebellion, monthslong targeting of the Portland ICE building with violence, intimidation and threats.”

In the order released Saturday evening, Judge Immergut wrote that the president’s argument about the need for mobilization was contradicted by evidence that recent protests had been comparatively quiet and nonviolent, supporting the state’s case that the decision to use troops “was not ‘conceived in good faith.’”

The nightly demonstrations at Portland’s ICE building began in early summer and have included occasional skirmishes between protesters and federal agents as demonstrators tried to block vehicles from entering and exiting a parking garage. Multiple times a day, ICE agents in riot gear march out of the building to clear the driveway. During daylight hours, the crowd disperses quickly. At times federal officers have used pepper balls, tear gas and other crowd dispersal weapons to move people back.The Portland Police Bureau reported 27 arrests since early June outside the building, and court records show at least two dozen arrests by federal officers.

The protests have turned rougher since the president’s announcement last weekend with the arrival of right wing counterprotesters, some of whom have been spotted observing the crowd from the ICE building roof. A march to protest the potential deployment Saturday afternoon ended with federal officers using tear gas and pepper balls against a crowd that had gathered in the road in front of the building.

Judge Immergut, a former U.S. attorney in Oregon, is the second federal judge assigned to Oregon’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump. The first recused after a request from the federal lawyers because his wife, Representative Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, had spoken out against the National Guard deployment.

JB Pritzker’s objections, the governor announced Saturday.

“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

The promised deployment comes as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, activity has ramped up in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.

There have also been two shootings, including one Saturday on the city’s Southwest Side.

Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.

The wave of raids and arrests has spurred large protests in recent weeks, especially outside of an ICE processing center in Broadview, a suburb eight miles west of Chicago. The demonstrations have spurred clashes between immigration agents and activists, leading to the arrests of several protestors last weekend on charges of resisting and assaulting officers. Agents have sprayed chemical agents and fired nonlethal rounds into the crowds outside the facility.

On Monday, Pritzker announced DHS was seeking 100 Illinois National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities and immigration agents in Illinois, warning the Trump administration would use any confrontation resulting from its Chicago-area immigration crackdown as a “pretext” for a military deployment.

On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a ”manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,“ Pritzker said, pointing to the Illinois State Police’s announcement this week that it had joined forces with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to form a “Unified Command” to coordinate law enforcement activity outside the ICE facility.

One of ISP’s first acts in Broadview was designating demonstration areas, also known as “free speech zones.” Pritzker on Saturday said the combined efforts of state and local law enforcement protected “people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.”

The Unified Command reported the arrests of at least five protesters on Friday, but none on Saturday. The area was quiet Saturday afternoon with only about a dozen protesters gathered, at times outnumbered by members of the media.

“I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people,” the governor said in his statement.

But shortly before Pritzker’s announcement about the National Guard deployment Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman in an altercation between immigration agents and protesters on Chicago’s Southwest Side.

According to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times, the woman was alleged to have been driving one of 10 cars that “rammed” and “boxed in” nearly three dozen immigration agents in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. Agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” according to the paper. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Trump and Pritzker have spent weeks trading barbs over the president’s threats to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, with the governor alleging Trump’s apparent backing off from the idea last month was a sign of dementia.

The governor has already vowed legal action against the Trump administration if and when the president activated the National Guard. After the president sent 1,400 National Guard troops to Los Angeles this summer — the first time since the 1960s that the feds deployed the National Guard without a governor’s consent — a federal judge last month ruled the move violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters. But the ruling only applies to California.

The National Guard’s presence in Los Angeles has dwindled to roughly 250, but there are still a couple thousand troops on assignment in Washington, D.C., where the federal government has more power over law enforcement. Since their August deployment to the nation’s capital, guardsmen have been reportedly picking up garbage, as they are only authorized to assist with arrests if asked by local law enforcement.

Trump has also threatened to federalize the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, though troops have not yet been sent. Tennessee’s Republican governor has welcomed the president’s recent suggestion that he’d deploy guardsmen to Memphis, but that has also yet to happen.

Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington, D.C. and Shelby County, Tennessee, where Memphis is situated, have all adopted so-called “sanctuary city” policies wherein local law enforcement are barred from assisting in federal immigration enforcement. Trump has targeted cities and states that have adopted such laws, and last week a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled the administration cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.

But this week, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he learned of another attempt by the White House to divert disaster relief funding from Illinois with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.”

Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois again on Friday. Noem has traveled to the Chicago area and Springfield several times this year, including last month when she oversaw an early morning raid in Elgin, where at least one U.S. citizen was arrested.

“Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability,” Pritzker said in a statement.

On Friday, Noem appeared with Gregory Bovino, commander-at-large of the U.S. Border Patrol, at the Broadview ICE facility with a camera crew, according to Chicago’s ABC 7.

Late Friday, Pritzker also said he’s making state resources available to people affected by a Sept. 30 raid on a South Shore apartment building.

In Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood, masked federal agents deployed a chemical irritant outside of a grocery store as people and cars lined up to block their advancement, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

State Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, condemned the action, which happened around the corner from an elementary school in her district. Chicago Ald.

That’s the last anyone saw of him.

Mr. Hurtado, 57, a computer systems engineer and a longtime political activist, is one of nearly three dozen people who human rights groups say have been disappeared by Nicaraguan authorities — taken away with officials refusing to acknowledge their detention or disclose their whereabouts.

Such disappearances are a violation of international law and are especially resonant in Latin America, where the practice has been a hallmark of brutal dictatorships. In Nicaragua, they have been happening within the past two years, the majority of them more recently.

Nearly half of the 73 political prisoners that human rights groups have officially documented in Nicaragua appear in no public court database. They have had no contact with their families, and the crimes they were charged with are unknown. Families have gone from prison to prison, police station to police station, seeking their loved ones, without success, human rights groups say.

The authorities summoned relatives to a coroner’s office and escorted them to a cemetery to bury Mr. Petri without the opportunity for an autopsy, human rights groups said.

Four days later, the body of Carlos Cárdenas Cepeda, a lawyer for the Catholic church, which has also been targeted by the government, was given back to his family. He had been detained for 15 days. No cause of death was given in either case, and the government has made no public pronouncements about them.

These deaths have alarmed the families of the others detained about whom the authorities have revealed nothing. Of those 33 missing prisoners, least a dozen are over 60, and several, like Mr. Hurtado, have diabetes and high blood pressure. One of the missing detainees is 81.

The police officers who showed up without warrants to arrest Mr. Hurtado and search his home in Managua suggested five police stations where the family might later find him, said Mr. Hurtado’s brother Adolfo.

Mr. Hurtado’s wife and his two brothers spent weeks visiting police stations and prisons, where they said they faced bureaucratic runarounds and hourslong waits.

“At first, two brothers and she went once a week, so three times a week, for more or less a month and a half,” Adolfo Hurtado said, referring to José Alejandro Hurtado’s wife. “That rhythm was unsustainable for the family.”

Adolfo Hurtado said he believes his brother was targeted because he had publicly released a proposal for national dialogue and elections to address the country’s political crisis.

Nicaragua’s co-presidents, but particularly Ms. Murillo, seem fixated on clearing the political landscape of any independent voices who could threaten her ability to govern if Mr. Ortega, who will turn 80 next month, dies.

Ms. Murillo, 74, who also acts as a government spokeswoman, did not respond to requests for comment.

Forced disappearances have a long and painful history in Latin America. The term “desaparecido” became synonymous with political repression between 1976 and 1983 in Argentina, when a military dictatorship abducted as many as 30,000 accused dissidents, tortured them and, in hundreds of cases, threw them from airplanes into the sea.

And throughout Latin America hundreds of thousands of people who have disappeared since the 1970s were taken to secret detention centers, tortured and executed. Many of their bodies were never found.

While hundreds of people eventually faced trial in Argentina, many cases of the disappeared went unpunished, said María Adela Antokoletz, who heads the Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.

“We realize that the abhorrent practice of enforced disappearance continues as a means to silence complaints,” she said.

Mexico, El Salvador and Colombia are three countries in the region where the practice still occurs, though more often perpetrated by gangs or cartels with the acquiescence of local police or mayors, Ms. Antokoletz said.

Authorities are obligated under international law to inform family members if they are holding someone, said Barbara Frey, a retired University of Minnesota professor who coedited a book about disappearances in contemporary Latin America.

“If the state has taken them and won’t tell the families where they are, that’s a disappearance,” Ms. Frey said. “That’s exactly what the definition says.”

The term historically applied to people missing for prolonged stretches of time, said Reed Brody, a member of the United Nations Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua. But international authorities have increasingly recognized that it also applies even to short-term secret detentions, like those in Nicaragua, he said.

Mr. Brody said the 33 documented cases in Nicaragua were believed to be an undercount because many families are too afraid to file a complaint with human rights organizations. The families have reported being harassed and threatened with arrest or having their property confiscated if they persist in trying to track down their loved ones, human rights experts said.

The missing include community leaders, teachers, Indigenous leaders, journalists and pastors. In at least five cases, multiple people in the same family were arrested. Many were detained over the summer, when more than 50 people were arrested in simultaneous roundups.

“It’s hard to know why some people are arrested and some people are disappeared,” Mr. Brody said.

Angelica Chavarríahas was last seen in May 2024, the same day her partner, Daniel Ortega’s brother Humberto, was placed under house arrest, according to human rights organizations.

He died last year.

Thelma Brenes says she has a theory behind the disappearances. Her father, Carlos Brenes Sánchez, 70, and his partner, Salvadora Martínez, 67, Ms. Brenes said, were taken on Aug. 14 from their home in Jinotepe, about 90 miles north of Managua, Ms. Brenes said.

“If they are disappearing people who they are not registering in jail, how can you prove that there are political prisoners in Nicaragua?” she said. “There are no pictures. He’s not in the system. Can we prove it?”

Mr. Brenes is a retired military colonel and a longtime opponent of Mr. Ortega. He was arrested in 2018 when he spoke out against government abuses after mass street protests but was released a year later under an amnesty law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/23/multimedia/00int-nicaragua-disappeared-jbkg/00int-nicaragua-disappeared-jbkg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:57:13.136435

Pritzker said the Department of War gave him an ultimatum, telling him to call up the troops himself.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said, in part. He said the administration intends to federalize hundreds of National Guard troops ""in the coming hours.""

A White House spokesperson shared a statement with ABC7 Chicago Saturday night, saying, ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

The announcement came after a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Portland for at least 14 days. Oregon's governor, said in a statement, ""justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed.""

The concern over a deployment of Illinois National Guard members prompted an emergency motion filed by Broadview leaders Saturday. The village is seeking the removal of the fence erected by federal authorities around the ICE facility amid ongoing demonstrations.

The village has called the fence illegal and a safety hazard, asking for a judge to grant the motion pending a Tuesday hearing on the village's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security.

DHS responded to that motion in its own court filing, saying there's no need for a hearing before Tuesday, bringing up the possibility of a settlement on Monday.

Amid the announcement of the federalization of the National Guard in Illinois, confrontations seemed to arise again Saturday in Broadview between demonstrators and Illinois State Police throughout the day.

""It's a continuing overreach by the president because the governor is responsible for calling up the troops when they think it's necessary,"" demonstrator Tony DiBenedetto said.

A crowd of anti-ICE demonstrators cheered on at least four people ABC7 saw detained by Illinois State Police as they were walked into a Cook County Sheriff's Office van in handcuffs. They were taken down as troopers were clearing the street outside the ICE detention center in Broadview, backing protesters into designated zones, feet from the immigration building and surrounded by concrete barriers. Federal agents were on the other side of the fence with their flying drone above it all.

""I'm not here to deal with the State Police. I'm here to deal with the kidnapping that ICE is doing, and it's immensely disappointing that State Police are putting themselves between us and ICE,"" demonstrator Will Creutz said.

Tensions continued throughout the night Saturday between Illinois State Police and demonstrators.

Federal agents and protesters also clashed at the west suburban Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Friday morning.

The Cook County Sheriff's Office said at least five people were arrested during those clashes. They are facing charges such as resisting, obstruction and aggravated battery to a police officer.

That clash came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino were seen on the ICE facility's roof just before 8 a.m. They were accompanied by several armed agents, cameras and a production crew.

President Donald Trump has previously threatened to send the National Guard to Chicago to combat crime, and even said earlier this week that the city could become a training ground for the military.

On Monday, Pritzker said he learned that DHS is requesting that 100 military personnel be sent to Illinois to protect ICE agents.

Full Saturday statement from Pritzker:

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will. It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.

In the coming hours, the Trump Administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. They will pull hardworking Americans out of their regular jobs and away from their families all to participate in a manufactured performance -- not a serious effort the protect public safety. For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control.

This demand follows unprecedented escalations of aggression against Illinois citizens and residents. Yesterday, Kristi Noem's and Greg Bovino's masked agents threw chemical agents near an elementary school, arrested elected officials exercising their First Amendment rights, and raided a Wal-Mart. None of it was in pursuit of justice, but all of it was in pursuit of social media videos.

I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois. State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people's ability to peacefully exercise their connotational rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump's acts of aggression against our people.

In Illinois, we will do everything within our power to look out for our neighbors, uphold the Constitution, and defend the rule of law.""

Statement from Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton:

""Donald Trump intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and deploy them to Chicago without the consent of Governor Pritzker or our administration. These are Illinoisans who will be ripped away from their families to serve in Trump's political stunt. We have warned that this has been their plan all along, and now it's here.

Our city is not a sandbox for Donald Trump to play dictator. It's intentional cruelty that will devastate families and scar our communities.

Let me be clear: the only emergency in Chicago is the chaos that Donald Trump and his administration are deliberately fueling in our streets. Journalists targeted and shot at, peaceful residents dragged from their homes, women and children zip-tied in the streets, families torn apart and stuffed into U-Hauls. This is unacceptable, reprehensible, and not what we stand for in Illinois.

""I have spent my career working to make communities safer and lead on public safety for our administration. Not a single violence-prevention expert I have worked with has ever said the answer is to flood our neighborhoods with federal troops. This move will only serve to spread fear, escalate conflict, and undermine the trust that keeps communities safe.

,Agencies,2025-10-05 12:43:28+00:00,Evanston RoundTable,State and local police aid ICE at Broadview protests - Evanston RoundTable,"Alex Harrison, Richard Cahan, Hope Perry",,,,,https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/10/04/broadview-ice-protests-illinois-state-police/,"The situation changed again Thursday evening, when the Illinois State Police announced that a “temporary Unified Command” has been established to “coordinate public safety measures” around the facility.
From an initial showing of two Broadview officers and three state troopers around 7 a.m., the local police presence grew by 10 a.m. to several dozen state troopers, sheriff’s police and officers from neighboring municipalities.
Ryan Glew confirmed that no Evanston officers were deployed to Broadview on Friday, the first time NIPAS has appeared at the ICE facility protests.
“If ICE agents want to terrorize protesters, police should not be blocking off roads to make it easier for ICE to do that,” Amiwala said.
“State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.","Dozens of state and local police officers aided federal officers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a protest near the agency’s Broadview holding facility Friday by helping escort federal vehicles and maintaining a large perimeter line, which at times included officers from a “police mutual aid” unit that the Evanston Police Department is a member of.

Protests have grown over the last several weeks at the west suburban facility, where ICE detainees have reported “dehumanizing” conditions while awaiting transfer to different locations. Recent demonstrations have included repeat appearances from Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss and fellow congressional candidates Kat Abughazaleh and Bushra Amiwala. After continuously using tear gas and pepperballs against protesters directly in front of the facility, ICE pushed protests back by erecting an unauthorized fence around the building, which the Village of Broadview has demanded be removed.

The situation changed again Thursday evening, when the Illinois State Police announced that a “temporary Unified Command” has been established to “coordinate public safety measures” around the facility. A news release listed ISP and the Broadview Police Department as partnering with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the county’s Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.

The release included a map of Beach Street, where the ICE building is located, which labeled the middle of the street as a “restricted area” and the sides and sidewalks as “protest areas.” These areas were separated on the ground by concrete barriers placed by the Illinois Department of Transportation.

“The Unified Command is setting up designated areas where people can safely exercise their rights, which will support the safety of the public, and ensure vehicular traffic can safely access the roads in the area,” ISP said in its statement. “The goal of the Unified Command is to protect the health and safety of all individuals, including nearby Broadview residents and businesses, and enable the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights.”

Intersection and traffic control

That area received little attention Friday morning, however, as both protesters and police concentrated farther south at the intersection of Harvard Street and 25th Avenue, which ICE vehicles used to enter and exit the facility.

From an initial showing of two Broadview officers and three state troopers around 7 a.m., the local police presence grew by 10 a.m. to several dozen state troopers, sheriff’s police and officers from neighboring municipalities. These officers maintained a perimeter covering the entire intersection and restricted traffic along 25th Avenue, ensuring federal vehicles could move freely.

Throughout the day, numerous protesters were detained by both federal and non-federal officers. Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol commander-at-large, was present when federal agents charged into the crowd without provocation and detained several people, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem was spotted on the Broadview facility’s roof in the morning as well.

Shortly before 11:15 a.m., a group of suburban police officers were deployed to the scene through the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS), specifically from its Mobile Field Force (MFF) designed to respond to “civil disturbances, union conflicts, public demonstrations” and other protest events, per its website. NIPAS is a suburban “police mutual aid” organization, meaning suburban members provide resources and personnel for deployment in incidents that exceed one member’s capacity.

EPD is a founding member of NIPAS, and as of June 2024 contributes seven officers to the MFF and six to the Emergency Services Team, which acts as a SWAT team. EPD Cmdr. Ryan Glew confirmed that no Evanston officers were deployed to Broadview on Friday, the first time NIPAS has appeared at the ICE facility protests.

NIPAS was not listed in the unified command’s initial press release, but the officers reportedly swapped in to relieve some state troopers from the scene.

A spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement that officers from the unified command “show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois.” The RoundTable on Friday, though, spotted multiple state troopers and NIPAS officers without names or ID numbers, wearing face masks, or both.

TRUST Act compliance

The heavy presence of state and local police, at times seen side-by-side and conversing with federal agents, led some people in the crowd and online to question whether the unified command was violating the Illinois TRUST Act, which prohibits local and state law enforcement in Illinois from supporting or assisting civil immigration enforcement “in any capacity.” The law says this includes “collateral assistance” and specifically identifies “establishing a security or traffic perimeter surrounding such operations” as an example of banned activities.

State officials defended the operation, however, as concerning public safety rather than ICE actions. Pritzker’s spokesperson said the unified command “will prioritize public safety above all else and take steps to safeguard the First Amendment rights of the public.” In a separate statement, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul wrote that the command’s purpose is to “maintain public safety and the ability to lawfully exercise First Amendment rights — not to engage in federal immigration enforcement.”

“State and local law enforcement do not violate the TRUST Act by establishing and maintaining designated protest areas and ensuring the unobstructed use of public roads,” Raoul said, “even if federal immigration enforcement activity is occurring nearby.”

Abughazaleh and Amiwala, who were present again Friday morning along with Mayor Biss, strongly disagreed with the deployment. Abughazaleh said during a press conference with other residents and elected officials that the “very existence” of designated protest areas implies “there are places where our First Amendment rights do not apply.”

“I understand why the state police have been deployed. It’s to make sure that ICE doesn’t have unilateral control,” Abughazaleh told the RoundTable after the press conference. “At the same time, I worry that sets up a precedent that they [ICE] can do whatever they want. … What we’re asking at this press conference and in general is to follow the damn law.”

Amiwala said later Friday morning that local police should not be “collaborating” with ICE “either which way,” whether in arrests around the area or in protest control outside the Broadview facility.

“If ICE agents want to terrorize protesters, police should not be blocking off roads to make it easier for ICE to do that,” Amiwala said. “I think this should send alarm signals as well as a violation of the TRUST Act.”

Biss took a different stance: speaking to the RoundTable near the main protest just before 9 a.m., he said there “was a very dangerous situation brewing here” with ICE “trying to provoke reaction,” which necessitated the state stepping in.

“I think the state police are trying to keep protesters safe,” Biss said. “Protesters have been at risk here because of the outrageous violence [from ICE].”

The RoundTable’s interview with Biss was interrupted three separate times by protesters who recognized the mayor, two of whom rebuked his view on the unified command.

“If I’m elected, I’m gonna be fighting to abolish ICE,” Biss told one protester, “but there’s a million steps on the way from here to there — like they shouldn’t be masked, like they shouldn’t be violently attacking nonviolent demonstrators, but they also shouldn’t be kidnapping our neighbors, which is the worst part of this.”

“The question is, what’s the best way to stop the outrage of ICE kidnapping our neighbors?” he asked another demonstrator.

“Yeah, is this it?” the protester replied, referring to the unified command from state and regional police.

“I’m not sure,” Biss answered.

ICE violence elsewhere, National Guard imminent

Friday’s protest in Broadview didn’t include the tear gas and pepper spray of earlier weeks, but elsewhere in the region, ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents have continued escalating violence against residents and local officials in and around Chicago:

Early Tuesday morning, agents used helicopters and flash grenades in a militarized raid on an entire apartment building in South Shore, with apartment doors blown off and both adults and kids dragged into vans without clothes on.

On Wednesday, agents choked and arrested a Black man in East Garfield Park following a car crash.

On Friday, agents tear gassed an intersection in Logan Square near a grocery store and school, and detained a Chicago alderperson at Humboldt Park Hospital while she was trying to check on a resident injured in an ICE raid.

On Saturday, Border Patrol agents shot a woman in Brighton Park, claiming she was part of a group that “boxed in” patrolling agents and that she “was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” claims which have not yet been independently verified by local media. Chicago police were deployed to separate the agents from an angry crowd of residents, and the agents later sped off while tear gassing both the residents and police present.

Finally, on Saturday, President Donald Trump issued an order to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard troops for local deployment, though it’s unclear when or they will be deployed. Notably, however, a federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to send the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a Saturday statement preempting the order. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,” Prtizker continued. “State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC0405-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 16:57:12.723048
,Human Rights,2025-10-05 12:20:30+00:00,NPR,Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump's National Guard deployment to Portland - NPR,Conrad Wilson,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5557239/trump-national-guard-portland-court-ruling,"A federal judge in Portland, Ore. temporarily blocked President Trump from federalizing 200 members of the state's National Guard.
The judge's decision in Portland comes as the administration deploys the National Guard to a number of American cities.
The records show police were in regular communication with federal officers at the Portland ICE facility.
Courts have been deliberating over the National Guard in California This is not the first time that the courts have weighed in on Trump's deployment of the National Guard over the objections of local officials.
""Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland,"" attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment.","A federal judge in Portland, Ore. temporarily blocked President Trump from federalizing 200 members of the state's National Guard.

U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government didn't meet the threshold for declaring recent ongoing protests outside an ICE facility in Portland a rebellion. She noted in her ruling that the Portland Police Bureau's 812 officers are trained in crowd management and First Amendment law. She also noted their mutual aid agreements with neighboring law enforcement agencies, as well as with the Oregon State Police and federal law enforcement, signaling that they had protests well in hand.

""If additional resources beyond all of these are critically needed, PPB may request that Oregon's Governor provide National Guard resources for a locally declared emergency,"" she wrote.

Since July, the judge's ruling said, the protests generally were limited to fewer than 30 people and were ""largely sedate.""

The ruling stated the Trump administration ""presented evidence of sporadic violence against federal officers and property damage to a federal building."" Immergut wrote that the government has not, however, offered any evidence demonstrating that those violent incidents were part of an organized attempt ""to overthrow the government as a whole.""

Immergut was appointed by President Trump in 2019.

A broader lawsuit filed Sept. 28 by the city and state asking the courts to declare Trump's deployment unlawful will move forward separately on a slower track.

The judge's decision in Portland comes as the administration deploys the National Guard to a number of American cities. Trump has sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and will soon send them to Memphis, Tennessee with the state's approval.

He's threatened to send them to Chicago, despite objections from city and state leaders there. Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, meanwhile, has requested troops to help with ""high crime rates"" in cities like New Orleans.

President Trump has said the deployments are needed to protect ICE agents as they carry out his mass deportation operations, as well as to reduce street crime. That's even though crime in some of the cities mentioned has been going down – including in Portland. The deployment to California was the first time in 60 years – since they were sent to protect civil rights activists in Alabama -- that a president deployed the National Guard over the objections of a state's governor.

Trump turned to Portland last week

President Trump announced on Sept. 27 his plan to send troops to ""war ravaged Portland."" In his social media post, the president said he was ""authorizing Full Force, if necessary"" to deal with ""domestic terrorists."" Trump did not specify what he meant by ""Full Force.""

In court documents, the Trump administration argued it was necessary to federalize the National Guard to protect federal personnel at an ICE facility in Portland that has ""experienced significant unrest targeting both the facility itself and those who work in it.""

State and local officials reject the idea that the situation on the ground requires the National Guard – saying protests outside the ICE facility have been small with no arrests by Portland Police in months until Trump's decision to federalize Oregon's Guard.

By day, legal observers, clergy and leaders from other religious and spiritual denominations stand outside the building, prepared to assist people showing up for required ""check-ins"" with ICE officials. By night, a small group of protesters – sometimes a dozen or fewer – have demonstrated outside the building.

Typically, says Portland's Police Chief Bob Day, they have largely been nonviolent and contained.

""The city of Portland is 145 square miles. And this is one city block,"" Day told reporters Monday. ""And even the events that are happening down there do not rise to the level of attention that they are receiving.""

Local officials say the protests had already dwindled

The protests are much smaller than the scores of people who for months in 2020 gathered at the federal courthouse in downtown Portland following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

On September 28, the State of Oregon and City of Portland sued to block the Trump administration from deploying troops to the state's largest city.

""In furtherance of a nationwide campaign to incorporate the military into civilian law enforcement—while also seeking to punish select, politically disfavored jurisdictions—they are preparing to deploy troops in Portland, Oregon,"" attorneys for the city and state wrote in their motion for a restraining order filed Monday. ""The facts do not remotely justify this overreach.""

In the same document, they said the Portland Police Bureau made 25 arrests at the ICE facility between June 11 and June 19 of this year, but hadn't had cause to make any more until administration announced they were deploying the National Guard. After the President's announcement Saturday, two more people were arrested Sunday. Cammilla Wamsley, a regional ICE supervisor, said in a sworn statement that federal law enforcement made more than 20 arrests over roughly three weeks this summer, separate from arrests by local police.

""On any given weekend,"" attorneys for the city and state wrote, ""the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has required PPB to dedicate greater resources than the small protests outside the ICE facility.""

Trump lawyers maintain federal agents are under threat

Lawyers for the administration countered in their own court documents that the deployment was justified because protests in Portland required the facility to close for about three weeks in June and July. They say protesters blocked the entrance, spray painted threats and doxed ICE agents online.

""Agitators have assaulted federal law enforcement officers with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices. They have damaged federal property, including by breaking office windows, security cameras, and card readers permitting entry to the building,"" they said.

On Friday, the administration announced it was investigating how Portland police have handled anti-ICE protests.

Records provided to the court by the city of Portland show throughout September before Trump made his announcement, protests rarely drew more than a few dozen people. The records show police were in regular communication with federal officers at the Portland ICE facility.

There were nights with incidents, such as Sept 20 when Portland Police noted that a Federal Protective Service officer called them ""throughout the night with info about black blockers assaulting people."" ""Black bloc"" groups wear black clothing and face coverings.

But the records show the majority of nights were calm, like the night before Trump's Sept. 27 announcement to send in the National Guard, when Portland police observed 8-15 people at any given time: ""Mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around."" Portland Police wrote, ""Energy was low, minimal activity.""

Courts have been deliberating over the National Guard in California

This is not the first time that the courts have weighed in on Trump's deployment of the National Guard over the objections of local officials. In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to confront protests against ICE operations. A federal judge ruled that the situation there did not constitute a level of interference with ICE or a ""rebellion"" against federal authority to justify sending in the troops.

But an appeals court overruled that finding, citing instances where ICE agents were ""pinned down"" and had ""concrete chunks"" and ""bottles of liquid"" thrown at them. Oregon officials tried to draw a distinction there.

""Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland,"" attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment. ""If the relatively small, contained, and largely sedated protests near Portland's ICE facility in recent weeks can justify military intervention, then the President's authority to federalize a state's National Guard … would be virtually unlimited.""

On Sept. 2, a California judge ruled that the troops in Los Angeles violated long-standing law against military forces performing civilian law enforcement by assisting ICE agents with traffic control and cordons for their operations. That ruling is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,"" Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Judge: The federal response didn't match the facts

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

White House says it will appeal

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president’s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

Portland protests were small, but grew after deployment was announced

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles (375 square km) and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.

The government agreed this year to settle an excessive force lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union by paying compensating several plaintiffs for their injuries.

We'll be ending our live coverage of this week's episode of Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg shortly. But before we do, let's catch you up on what we heard:

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was asked what the government will do to protect Jewish communities in the UK.

It comes after many said they were ""shocked, but not surprised"" by the attack on a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, which killed two Jewish men and left three others in a serious condition.

The home secretary pointed to a new announcement about expanding police powers to restrict repeat protests - but acknowledged that the government hasn't got the balance right yet.

Manchester rabbis Josh Levy and Kath Vardi told the programme that anti-Semitism has been allowed to develop and grow in the UK.

And as the Conservative Party conference looms, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch insisted that the her party's plans toremove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years will pay off.

Thanks for joining us.

Badenoch's policy proposals are shocking - and that's intentional

Harry Farley

Political correspondent, reporting from Manchester

The plan for a ""Removals Force"" is really quite radical when you look at the details. It's based on a controversial American model and would double the funding of the current unit in the Home Office.

The Conservatives have also promised an overhaul of the asylum system, with tighter restrictions on who could claim refuge. That’s all underpinned by a promise for the UK to leave the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).

These are bold policies all designed to grab attention and restore confidence as the Conservative Party conference begins in Manchester.

But a number of Conservatives are worried about the impact leaving the ECHR might have on the UK's reputation.

Kemi Badenoch will be trying to address those internal critics who are still wondering whether she is the right person to lead the party forward.

Recap: What we heard this week

If you're just catching up, let's take a quick look back at what we heard on today's programme.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was pressed on the government's response to antisemitism in the wake of Thursday's attack in Manchester at a Jewish synagogue.

She said the investigation was progressing and she had been in touch with the families of the victims.

The home secretary said Jewish people are justified in their anger at the government, adding their concerns are informing proposed new police powers over protests. She insisted that people would still have freedom to protest, but the new laws would make sure the wider community was also protected.

We also heard from two Manchester-based Rabbis who said antisemitism had been allowed to grow in the UK, and they were not surprised by the attack on a synagogue.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that protest laws needed improvement, but questioned why it had taken the government so long to address them.

She was then asked about her plans to return 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK if the Conservatives win the next election. Badenoch insisted her plans, which include leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, ""were credible"".

She also spoke about rowing back on the UK's climate commitments to ensure the country wasn't losing out commercially to foreign rivals, and defended her record as party leader, saying she maintains the backing of party members.

Badenoch won't commit to resigning if Tories don't succeed in next election

Badenoch is pushed on her plans and leadership. The Conservative Party's position has gotten worse, Kuenssberg says.

But Badenoch pushes back and says polls are not results. She is instead taking time to work on plans that won't fall apart, she adds.

The final question from Kuenssberg is: ""What if the problem is you?""

Badenoch says she was elected to do ""exactly what I am doing now"" and she believes her party will keep faith.

Asked if she will resign if things go badly at the next elections in May, Badenoch repeats that she was elected to do what she is doing now.

With that, the interview concludes.

Badenoch says government climate plans not working

The interview now moves on to Tory policies on the climate.

Badenoch says the the government's plans are not working and not stopping climate change.

She says that we've made changes to comply with the Paris agreement, but the UK is the only country in the world who have done that. She then lists climate initiatives that she says are making other countries rich at the cost of the UK.

She says companies are leaving because of the UK's environmental laws and workers are losing their jobs.

Badenoch says human rights can be protected without ECHR membership

Turning now to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which the Conservatives said they would leave, Badenoch is asked if they really want the UK to leave a decades-old European agreement.

The Tory leader lists off countries including the US, Canada and Australia, saying they are not party to the ECHR. Kuenssberg points out these are not European countries.

Badenoch says you don't need to be in the convention to have human rights. ""Our human rights existed long before the ECHR,"" she argues.

She says the UK is paying money to handle a problem that's getting more difficult.

The Conservatives have not said they would leave the Refugee Convention, Badenoch says, but they will be prepared to leave anything stopping them from securing the borders.

'I want to make sure we have strong borders' - Badenoch

Pushed by Kuenssberg to offer a plan to remove illegal immigrants from the UK, Badenoch says the Conservatives will be standing up for a force - the Removals Force - which doesn't currently exist.

She says that families of children hurt by illegal migrants want to know why the government isn't acting.

Kuenssberg pushes back, asking Badenoch how the party will make it happen.

Badenoch says funding will come from the money currently spent on housing asylum seekers in hotels and ""dealing with migration issues"".

""I want to make sure that we have strong borders, and I've come up with a plan to do it,"" Badenoch says, admitting that it will be tough.

Badenoch insists Tory plan on migration is credible

Kuenssberg says that questioning where people have to go is not irrelevant, but Badenoch says we can't have a ""defeatist attitude"" and the Tories have a credible plan.

Badenoch is asked if it's a credible plan, where will the people go? She answers ""not here"".

""We need to have stronger borders"", Badenoch says. She says that the plans are not just about deporting 750,000 people, it's about leaving the ECHR, banning asylum claims from people who have arrived illegally and the return scheme.

Where would migrants removed from UK go?

Kuenssberg moves onto the Conservative pledge to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election.

Where would they go? Kuenssberg asks Badenoch.

The Tory leader says there are too many people in the UK that shouldn't be here, and they need to go back to their countries. She adds that the Tories had a Rwanda plan ""that worked"".

Pushed again on where would people go, Badenoch says ""not here"".

""They should not be here, we need to look after the our people,"" she adds, calling the question of where they would go ""irrelevant"".

Badenoch asks why plan to restrict repeat protests 'took so long'

Laura Kuenssberg turns now to Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, ahead of the party's conference in Manchester over the next few days.

She begins by asking Badenoch if she backs the government's proposals over restricting repeated protests.

Badenoch says yes, but questions why it ""took so long"". She also questions why the public should trust Mahmood, after the home secretary protested outside a branch of the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain in 2014 to call for it to stop stocking goods from Israeli settlements.

She adds that the Jewish community is very concerned that the government won't support them.

Rabbis say antisemitism allowed to grow in the UK

We're now hearing from Josh Levy and Kath Vardi, two rabbis from Manchester.

Levy says for many of the Jewish community, the synagogue attack was a ""matter of when, not if"".

It isn't normal to have to have security outside a place of worship, Levy tells Kuenssberg, and says antisemitism has been allowed to develop and grow in the UK.

The line between protesting and inciting hate is narrow, Kath Vardi adds, continuing that people need to be held responsible for the messages that they're shouting at protests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/9b4d/live/99140590-a1c9-11f0-aa4e-41121ee831f6.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 07:57:33.932013

WASHINGTON – This morning, Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, driving one of the vehicles, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxxing federal agents. She took defensive fire from CBP agents and has been discharged from the hospital and is currently in the custody of the FBI. The driver of another vehicle, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in the ramming has been apprehended by law enforcement.

The scene became increasingly violent as more domestic terrorists gathered and began throwing smoke, gas, rocks, and bottles at DHS law enforcement. Another domestic terrorist was arrested for assaulting CBP at the scene. Following JB Prtizker’s refusal to allow local police to help secure the scene, Secretary Noem has deployed special operations teams to restore law and order.

As our ICE law enforcement was responding to the shooting, a domestic terrorist followed them and rammed their vehicle in an attempt to run them off the road. This individual has also been arrested and is in HSI custody.

An ICE vehicle popped a tire and was subsequently mobbed by domestic terrorists, forcing law enforcement to abandon the vehicle for their own safety. The vehicle was significantly damaged.

Several CBP law enforcement officers were sent to the hospital with various injuries.

Statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin:

“These attacks on our brave law enforcement officers must END. Secretary Noem has taken action to deploy additional resources to restore law and order. We will not allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement. If you law a hand on law enforcement, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Savage, www.latimes.com, david-g-savage",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-10-05/supreme-court-trump-claims-of-unchecked-power,"Supreme Court justices like to talk about the Constitution’s separation of powers and how it limits the exercise of official authority.

Last month, Trump administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to rule during the upcoming term on the birthright citizenship promised by the 14th Amendment of 1868.","Supreme Court justices like to talk about the Constitution’s separation of powers and how it limits the exercise of official authority.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts and his conservative colleagues have given no sign so far they will check President Trump’s one-man governance by executive order.

To the contrary, the conservative justices have repeatedly ruled for Trump on fast-track appeals and overturned federal judges who said the president had exceeded his authority.

The court’s new term opens on Monday, and the justices will begin hearing arguments.

But those regularly scheduled cases have been overshadowed by Trump’s relentless drive to remake the government, to punish his political enemies, including universities, law firms, TV networks and prominent Democrats, and to send troops to patrol U.S. cities.

The overriding question has become: Are there any legal limits on the president’s power? The Supreme Court itself has raised the doubts.

A year ago, as Trump ran to reclaim the White House, the justices blocked a felony criminal indictment against him related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, mob attack on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election, for which Trump was impeached.

Led by Roberts, the court ruled for Trump and declared for the first time that presidents were immune from being prosecuted for their official actions in the White House.

Not surprisingly, Trump saw this as a “BIG WIN” and proof there is no legal check on his power.

This year, Trump’s lawyers have confidently gone to Supreme Court with emergency appeals when lower-court judges have stood in their way. With few exceptions, they have won, often over dissents from the court’s three liberal Democrats.

Many court scholars say they are disappointed but not surprised by the court’s response so far to Trump’s aggressive use of executive power.

The Supreme Court “has been a rubber stamp approving Trump’s actions,” said UC Berkeley law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. “I hope very much that the court will be a check on Trump. There isn’t any other. But so far, it has not played that role.”

Roberts “had been seen as a Republican but not a Trump Republican. But he doesn’t seem interested or willing to put any limits on him,” said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler. “Maybe they think they’re saving their credibility for when it really counts.”

Acting on his own, Trump moved quickly to reshape the federal government. He ordered cuts in spending and staffing at federal agencies and fired inspectors general and officials of independent agencies who had fixed terms set by Congress. He stepped up arrests and deportations of immigrants who are here illegally.

But the court’s decisions on those fronts are in keeping with the long-standing views of the conservatives on the bench.

Long before Trump ran for office, Roberts had argued that the Constitution gives the president broad executive authority to control federal agencies, including the power to fire officials who disagree with him.

The court’s conservatives also think the president has the authority to enforce — or not enforce — immigration laws.

That’s also why many legal experts think the year ahead will provide a better test of the Supreme Court and Trump’s challenge to the constitutional order.

“Overall, my reaction is that it’s too soon to tell,” said William Baude, a University of Chicago law professor and a former clerk for Roberts. “In the next year, we will likely see decisions about tariffs, birthright citizenship, alien enemies and perhaps more, and we’ll know a lot more.”

In early September, Trump administration lawyers rushed the tariffs case to the Supreme Court because they believed it was better to lose sooner rather than later.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government could face up to a $1-trillion problem if the court delayed a decision until next summer and then ruled the tariffs were illegal.

“Unwinding them could cause significant disruption,” he told the court.

The Constitution says tariffs, taxes and raising revenue are matters for Congress to decide. Through most of American history, tariffs funded much of the federal government. That began to change after 1913 when the 16th Amendment was adopted to authorize “taxes on incomes.”

Trump has said he would like to return to an earlier era when import taxes funded the government.

“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said at a rally after his inauguration in January. “Because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.”

While he could have gone to the Republican-controlled Congress to get approval, he imposed several rounds of large and worldwide tariffs acting on his own.

Several small businesses sued and described the tariffs as “the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.”

As for legal justification, the president’s lawyers pointed to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. It authorizes the president to “deal with any unusual or extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.”

The law did not mention tariffs, taxes or duties but said the president could “regulate” the “importation” of products.

Trump administration lawyers argue that the “power to ‘regulate importation’ plainly encompasses the power to impose tariffs.” They also say the court should defer to the president because tariffs involve foreign affairs and national security.

They said the president invoked the tariffs not to raise revenue but to “rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders.”

In response to lawsuits from small businesses and several states, judges who handle international trade cases ruled the tariffs were illegal. However, they agreed to keep them in place to allow for appeals.

Their opinion relied in part on recent Supreme Court’s decisions which struck down potentially far-reaching regulations from Democratic presidents on climate change, student loan debt and COVID-19 vaccine requirements. In each of the decisions, Roberts said Congress had not clearly authorized the disputed regulations.

Citing that principle, the federal circuit court said it “seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”

Trump said that decision, if allowed to stand, “could literally destroy the United States of America.” The court agreed to hear arguments in the tariffs case on Nov. 5.

A victory for Trump would be “viewed as a dramatic expansion of presidential power,” said Washington attorney Stephanie Connor, who works on tariff cases. Trump and future presidents could sidestep Congress to impose tariffs simply by citing an emergency, she said.

But the decision itself may have a limited impact because the administration has announced new tariffs last week that were based on other national security laws.

Last month, Trump administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to rule during the upcoming term on the birthright citizenship promised by the 14th Amendment of 1868.

They did not seek a fast-track ruling, however. Instead, they said the court should grant review and hear arguments on the regular schedule early next year. If so, a decision would be handed down by late June.

The amendment says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States.”

And in the past, both Congress and the Supreme Court have agreed that rule applies broadly to all children who are born here, except if their parents are foreign ambassadors or diplomats who are not subject to U.S. laws.

But Trump Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer said that interpretation is mistaken. He said the post-Civil War amendment was “adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children, not to the children of illegal aliens, birth tourists and temporary visitors.”

Judges in three regions of the country have rejected Trump’s limits on the citizenship rule and blocked it from taking effect nationwide while the litigation continues.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29e0eff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6123x3215+0+435/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F9e%2F831abe4e4ae69296cd11f8bb770d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2203860656,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:32.955435

,Policy,2025-10-05 11:16:41+00:00,Axios,How the U.S. bypassed rules to rush deportees to Africa - Axios,Brittany Gibson,,,,,https://www.axios.com/2025/10/05/us-trump-deport-criminals-africa,"It's unclear whether U.S. officials gave those deportees' home countries a chance to accept the return of their citizens — as has long been required by law — before sending them to the prisons in Africa.
A Mexican man was sent to South Sudan despite the Mexican government's policy of always accepting its citizens deported from the U.S.
It's unclear whether U.S. officials tried to contact Mexico before sending the man to South Sudan.
In the case of a Jamaican man who was sent to Eswatini, Jamaican officials say they learned of his deportation from media reports, not U.S. officials.
Eswatini agreed to accept 160 deportees for $5.1 million, according to a copy of the agreement signed May 14.","The Trump administration's rush to quickly deport immigrants with criminal records has led U.S. officials to send several men to prisons in Africa even though their home countries would have taken them back, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: President Trump's team has justified deportations to prisons in Eswatini and South Sudan by claiming that no other countries — including the immigrants' homelands — would accept criminals ousted from the U.S.

But foreign government officials, immigration attorneys and court filings indicate that wasn't the case with at least two groups of deportees this summer that included a dozen migrants from Mexico, Vietnam and Jamaica who'd been convicted of crimes such as murder and robbery.

It's unclear whether U.S. officials gave those deportees' home countries a chance to accept the return of their citizens — as has long been required by law — before sending them to the prisons in Africa.

Zoom out: Unlike the hundreds of Venezuelans the Department of Homeland Security deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador — or the dozens of asylum seekers sent to Costa Rica and Panama — the two groups of deportees whose cases were examined by Axios had judges' orders to be removed from the U.S.

For such deportees, U.S. law requires judges to designate a preferred country or the deportee's country of origin as the priority destination.

A second option is for the deportee to be sent to a country with which he or she has ties. Deportation to a ""third country"" unfamiliar to the deportee is only a last resort.

What they're saying: ""The Trump administration has just skipped all of those steps"" and simply moved immigrants ""to a country that's willing to accept them — and that, we think, is a clear violation of statute,"" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney leading a class-action lawsuit againsst ""third country"" deportations.

""DHS does not have unfettered discretion to decide where to send noncitizens,"" one court document argues in the lawsuit.

""This is all meant to be a punitive stunt, fear-mongering stunt to play out in the media,"" Realmuto told Axios.

Zoom in: Eleven people were on the first flights to South Sudan and Eswatini despite having no ties to those countries, and several more were put on flights to Rwanda and Ghana, Axios' review of the cases found.

A Mexican man was sent to South Sudan despite the Mexican government's policy of always accepting its citizens deported from the U.S. He's now been returned to Mexico.

It's unclear whether U.S. officials tried to contact Mexico before sending the man to South Sudan. ""Mexico accepts the returns of its nationals. Period. Full stop,"" said Anwen Hughes, an attorney for Human Rights First, who represented the man.

In the case of a Jamaican man who was sent to Eswatini, Jamaican officials say they learned of his deportation from media reports, not U.S. officials.

Jamaica's foreign minister said in a statement that her nation hadn't refused the return of any of its citizens from the U.S. The Jamaican deportee eventually was returned to his home country.

For a Vietnamese man deported to Eswatini and another deported to South Sudan, it appears U.S. immigration officials didn't notify Vietnam of its citizens' removals.

Tin Thanh Nguyen, an immigration attorney working on both men's cases, told Axios there's no evidence of U.S. officials requesting travel documents from the Vietnamese government, which typically starts the deportation process.

One of his clients was first told he was headed to Eswatini while sitting on the plane that was headed there, Nguyen said.

The latest: Officials in Eswatini and South Sudan now say they'll return all of the men to their native countries — eventually — despite the U.S. government's claims that wasn't possible.

""The repatriation process has already begun .... In, maybe, less than 12 months they should all be going back to their countries,"" Eswatini government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli said in an interview with South African Broadcasting.

South Sudan's foreign affairs ministry said it's also committed to returning the deportees that nation received to their home countries.

The other side: ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, you could end up in [El Salvador], Eswatini, South Sudan or another third country,"" U.S. Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Trisha McLaughlin said.

""President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens out of American communities and out of our country,"" McLaughlin added.

""Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States. Illegal aliens who commit barbaric crimes are frequently not taken back by their home countries.""

What to watch: Texts of two ""third country"" agreements, obtained by Axios, indicate the U.S. could send hundreds more deportees to Africa in exchange for millions of dollars.

Eswatini agreed to accept 160 deportees for $5.1 million, according to a copy of the agreement signed May 14.

Rwanda signed up to be paid $7.5 million to accept 250 deportees in a deal signed on June 3.",https://images.axios.com/o_baC1Y6hHmkWthjf0s1XfAJ3h4=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/09/19/1758309886071.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:35.978265

After a three-month recess, the nine justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket, and discuss appeals that have piled up over the summer. The high court will resume oral arguments to confront issues like gender identity, election redistricting, and free speech.

But looming over the federal judiciary is the return of Trump-era legal battles. The administration has been winning most of the emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since January, that dealt only with whether challenged policies could go into effect temporarily, while the issues play out in the lower courts — including immigration, federal spending cuts, workforce reductions and transgender people in the military.

In doing so, the 6-3 conservative majority has reversed about two dozen preliminary nationwide injunctions imposed by lower federal courts, leading to frustration and confusion among many judges.

FEDERAL JUDGES ANONYMOUSLY CRITICIZE SUPREME COURT FOR OVERTURNING DECISIONS WITH EMERGENCY RULINGS

Now those percolating petitions are starting to reach the Supreme Court for final review — and legal analysts say the bench may be poised to grant broad unilateral powers to the president.

The justices fast-tracked the administration’s appeal over tariffs on dozens of countries that were blocked by lower courts. Oral arguments will be held in November.

In December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.

And in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in a major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.

""A big fraction of the Supreme Court's docket will present the question: ‘can President Trump do?’— then fill in the blank. And that could be imposing tariffs; firing independent board members; removing illegal aliens; sending the military into cities like Los Angeles,"" said Thomas Dupree, a prominent appellate attorney and constitutional law expert. ""So, much of what the Supreme Court is deciding this term is whether the president has acted within or has exceeded his authority.""

The tariffs dispute will be the court's first major constitutional test on the merits over how broadly the conservative majority high court views Trump's muscular view of presidential power, a template for almost certain future appeals of his executive agenda.

Presidential prerogative or power push?

In earlier disputes over temporary enforcement of those policies, the court's left-leaning justices warned against the judiciary becoming a rubber stamp, ceding its power in favor of this president.

After a late August high court order granting the government the power to temporarily terminate nearly $800 million in already-approved health research grants, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said her conservative colleagues had ""ben[t] over backward to accommodate"" the Trump administration. ""Right when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints, the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.""

But some of Jackson's colleagues have denied they are paving the way for Trump's aggressive efforts to redo the federal government.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT WEIGHS TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER AS ADMIN OUTLINES ENFORCEMENT DETAILS

""The framers recognized, in a way that I think is brilliant, that preserving liberty requires separating the power,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh earlier this month at a Texas event. ""No one person or group of people should have too much power in our system.""

And Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Fox News' Bret Baier three weeks ago that she and her colleagues ""don't wear red and blue, we all wear black because judges are nonpartisan ... We're all trying to get it right. We're not playing for a team.""

Barrett, who is promoting her new book, ""Listening to the Law,"" said her court takes a long-term view, and is not reflexively on Trump's side.

""We're not deciding cases just for today. And we're not deciding cases based on the president, as in the current occupant of the office,"" Barrett told Fox News. ""I think the judiciary needs to stay in its lane ... we're taking each case and we're looking at the question of presidential power as it comes. And the cases that we decide today are going to matter, four presidencies from now, six presidencies from now.""

KAVANAUGH CITES 3 PRESIDENTS IN EXPLAINING SUPREME COURT'S BALLOONING EMERGENCY DOCKET

These sharp court fractures between competing ideologies will likely escalate, as the justices begin a more robust look at a president's power, and by dint, their own.

Divisive decisions

""He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,"" Trump cryptically posted on social media a month after retaking office.

Federal courts have since been trying to navigate and articulate the limits of the executive branch, while managing their own powers.

Yet several federal judges — appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents — have expressed concern that the Supreme Court has been regularly overturning rulings by lower courts dealing with challenges to Trump administration policies — mostly with little or no explanation in its decisions.

Those judges — who all requested anonymity to speak candidly — tell Fox News those orders blocking enforcement have left the impression they are not doing their jobs or are biased against the President.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TORPEDOES SCOTUS WITH EMERGENCY REQUESTS AND SEES SURPRISING SUCCESS

Those frustrations have spilled into open court.

""They’re leaving the circuit courts, the district courts out in limbo,"" said federal appeals Judge James Wynn about the high court, during oral arguments this month over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security data.

""We're out here flailing,"" said Wynn, an Obama bench appointee. ""I'm not criticizing the justices. They're using a vehicle that’s there, but they are telling us nothing. They could easily just give us direction, and we would follow it.""

Courting controversy

The president may be winning short-term victories in a court where he has appointed a third of its members, but that has not stopped him or his associates from criticizing federal judges, even calling for their removal from office when preliminary rulings have gone against the administration.

""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!"" Trump posted on social media, after a March court ruling temporarily halting the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members.

The target of the attack was DC-based Chief Judge James Boasberg, appointed to the bench by President Obama.

Top Trump White House policy advisor Stephen Miller, in interviews, has warned against some unaccountable and ""communist crazy judges"" ""trying to subvert the presidency.""

TRUMP TURNS TO SUPREME COURT IN FIGHT TO OUST BIDEN-ERA CONSUMER SAFETY OFFICIALS

According to ananalysis by Stanford University's Adam Bonica, federal district judges ruled against the administration 94.3% of the time between May and June.

But the Supreme Court has in turn reversed those injunctions more than 90% of the time, giving the president temporary authority to move ahead with his sweeping reform agenda.

As for the rhetoric, the high court has walked a delicate path, reluctant to criticize Trump directly, at least for now.

""The fact that some of our public leaders are lawyers advocating or making statements challenging the rule of law tells me that, fundamentally, our law schools are failing,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor at a recent Georgetown University Law Center event, without naming Trump by name. ""Once we lose our common norms, we’ve lost the rule of law completely.""

Chief Justice John Roberts in March offered a rare public statement criticizing impeachment calls from the right.

But several federal judges who spoke to Fox News also wish Roberts would do more to assert his authority and to temper what one judge called ""disturbing"" rhetoric.

The U.S. Marshals Service — responsible for court security — reports more than 500 threats against federal judges since last October, more than in previous years. Law enforcement sources say that includes Boasberg, who, along with his family, has received physical threats and intimidating social media posts.

TURLEY: JUSTICE JACKSON SHOWS ‘JUDICIAL ABANDON’ IN LONE DISSENT ON TRUMP LAYOFF RULING

""I think it is a sign of a culture that has, where political discourse has soured beyond control,"" said Justice Barrett in recent days.

""The attacks are not random. They seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity,"" said Justice Jackson in May. ""The threats and harassment are attacks on our democracy, on our system of government.""

The administration in recent days asked Congress for $58 million more in security for executive branch officials and judges, following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who led Turning Point USA.

Testy term awaits

A Fox News poll from this summer found 47% of voters approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, a 9-point jump since last year when a record low 38% approved.

""Over the past decade, public confidence in our major institutions has declined,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps conduct the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""The Court’s rebound could reflect its attempts to steer a middle course on politically polarizing questions or indicate an uptick in positive attitudes toward our more venerable institutions.""

Still, by more than 2-to-1, more voters think the court is too conservative (43%) than too liberal in its decisions (18%, a low), while 36% think the court’s rulings are about right. That continues a seven-year trend.

FEDERAL JUDGES ANONYMOUSLY CRITICIZE SUPREME COURT FOR OVERTURNING DECISIONS WITH EMERGENCY RULINGS

The public's views of the court's ability to steer clear of politics will be tested this term.

Besides the two Trump-related appeals, the justices are already scheduled to decide:

At least two appeals involving LGBTQ+ rights: which public school sports teams transgender students can join; and state laws banning so-called ""conversion therapy"" for minors who may have gender identity or sexual orientation issues.

Two election-related disputes involving partisan gerrymandering and federal campaign spending coordination that each could have major impacts on the 2026 midterms and beyond.

Precedent on a precipice

But court watchers are pointing to several hot-button pending appeals where ""stare decisis"" or respect for established landmark court rulings will be tested: same-sex marriage and communal school prayer.

The high court is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to put those petitions on its argument calendar, with possible rulings on the merits by June 2026.

But other cases are already awaiting a final ruling: the use of race in redistricting under the Voting Rights Act; and independent government boards.

""I think the likeliest candidates for being revisited are the ones that involve the power of the president to fire the heads of federal agencies,"" said attorney Dupree. ""This is an old precedent that's been on the books really back since the New Deal, and it's come into question in recent years. There's been a long shadow hanging over these decisions, and I think the Supreme Court is poised to revisit those this term and in all likelihood overrule that.""

The court may have already set the stage, by using the emergency docket in recent weeks to allow Trump to temporarily fire members of several other independent federal agencies without cause. The court's liberal wing complained that giving the president that power without explanation effectively unravels the 1935 precedent known as ""Humphrey's Executor.""

KAVANAUGH CITES 3 PRESIDENTS IN EXPLAINING SUPREME COURT'S BALLOONING EMERGENCY DOCKET

""Today’s order favors the president over our precedent,"" said Justice Elena Kagan in a blistering dissent against Trump's removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board.

The court's ""impatience to get on with things — to now hand the President the most unitary, meaning also the most subservient, administration since Herbert Hoover (and maybe ever) — must reveal how that eventual decision will go"" on the merits, added Kagan.

Sotomayor said recent overturned precedents were ""really bad"" for certain groups of people.

""And that’s what’s at risk, is in each time we change precedent, we are changing the contours of a right that people thought they had,"" she said this month. ""Once you take that away, think of how much more is at risk later. Not just in this situation.""

The conservative justices in recent years have not been shy about revisiting cases that had been settled for decades but now have been overturned: the nationwide right to abortion, affirmative action in education and the discretionary power of federal agencies.

Other pending issues the justices may soon be forced to confront which could upset longstanding precedent include libel lawsuits from public officials, flag burning and Ten Commandments displays in public schools.

One justice who has been more willing than his benchmates to overrule precedents may be its most influential: Justice Clarence Thomas.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.
Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.
Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.
As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.","Kemi Badenoch plans to create a new “Removals Force” modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.

The proposals, which will be set out in more detail as the Tory conference begins on Sunday, will see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

Mrs Badenoch told the Telegraph she “wouldn’t be surprised” if US President Mr Trump “loved” her migration plan, but said she was more interested in the views of people in the UK.

She pledged to stop “silly arguments” about human rights from stopping her doing the “right thing” if she was in No 10.

The new force will be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

In the US, Ice has been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and American citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.

Immigration is to be one of the key themes of the gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system, in which refugee status would be granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants, and saying there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The Tories have said they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if they win the next election, saying the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.

Her party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.

Asked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.

“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the country needed to “send a very clear signal” that anyone arriving illegally had “zero chance of making a life in the UK”.

He told the Sunday Express: “We have to secure our borders and we have got to bring the numbers of people coming into our country right down and give everyone breathing space.”

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/resources/images/20038062.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-10-05 11:56:20.289009

(KOIN) — Federal agents took several protesters into custody and deployed gas and pepper balls at least three times against a crowd of hundreds who gathered for a demonstration in front of the Portland ICE facility Saturday afternoon.

There was a noticeable contingent of counter-protesters among those gathered at the ICE facility throughout the day.

The events initially began as a march from Elizabeth Caruthers Park to the ICE facility organized primarily by Portland Contra Las Deportaciones (PDXCD).

One of the protesters into taken into custody was Holly Brown, one of the organizers of the march.

Brown, who was released around 5:30 p.m., said it was “really horrible inside.”

“There’s different holding cells with, like, really harsh fluorescent lights. There’s no bedding. It’s just like concrete. And the phones didn’t work. They didn’t have phones working in the entire facility,” Brown told KOIN 6 News. “There’s, all these different, like, posters on the wall encouraging people to self-deport. It’s a really horrible, horrible place.”

She said she was charged with trespassing on federal property.

KOIN 6 News saw at least one other person released from ICE custody. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to a KOIN 6 News request for details on how many people were arrested on Saturday.

The mood temporarily cooled down after the initial use of tear gas and protesters were seen dancing in the street. Then at round 3 p.m., after some vehicles were let through the streets near the facility, federal agents deployed more gas against protesters.

Dozens of pepper balls were also deployed by federal agents around 7 p.m. Then, shortly before 9 p.m., KOIN 6 News saw federal agents tear gas groups of people who were blocks away from the ICE facility.

“What we did not expect in the targeted arrests was the full-on pushing that they did,” protester Rainbow told KOIN 6 News. “In the pushing, I ended up getting clocked in the eye by one of the federal agents, then they started tear gassing really bad.”

Rainbow said she saw an elderly couple in the group of protesters. The woman got hit in the head with a tear gas canister and began bleeding, eventually receiving help from medics. Rainbow claimed federal agents “tear-gassed the heck out of” the man who was using a walker to move around.

Rainbow added that since there were elderly people in the group who marched, they were not expecting this level of force.

“Pepper bullets? Yeah. Tear gas? no,” she said.

A large presence of Portland police were also observed in full gear and staged a few blocks away from the ICE facility.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/ice-facility-macadam-h-10042025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-05 07:58:05.681503

We don't know when the next elections will be, but it seems that immigration will be one of the main topics of debate. Why?

— This is happening not only in Spain, but across all international agendas. For example, President [Donald] Trump's migration policy is instilling fear and causing pain. In Spain, we are committed to implementing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum from a humanist perspective. Migratory flows are inherent to human beings, not only because of the complex international context we are currently experiencing, but also because of climate change, so it's important to consider how migration policy is managed.

Last week, the People's Party (PP) proposed a points-based visa. What do you think?

— If you can call them proposals... The PP twisted and presented a reality that doesn't fit with what's happening. They talk about uncontrolled migration, and the figures refute this. Illegal arrivals represent only 6% of the total. We're looking at affiliation data in which foreigners play a very important role. These two issues alone dismantle the false narrative that the PP is trying to present about uncontrolled migration. They're trying to create new proposals, but what they are is a bravado of xenophobia and racism. The points-based visa is a regulatory aberration that contravenes European regulations and the Constitution, and is discriminatory. Mr. [Alberto Núñez] Feijóo would do well not to be swayed by misinformation and lies in the purest far-right style.

Is there first-class and second-class immigration?

— This is what the far right and the People's Party (PP) are playing with. They're trying to instill in society the idea that foreigners come to collect a state allowance, when the regulations themselves, for example, regarding the minimum living wage, require legal residency for at least one year. And they're also playing on the perception that there is a much larger foreign population, when the data doesn't reflect this; or on the perception that 40% are unemployed. It's important to dismantle this with data.

Is the right successfully setting the agenda on immigration?

— They're not setting the agenda. What's happening is that the PP has chosen to buy into the far-right's framework and create an irresponsible opposition. The reality is stubborn: Spain is a land of opportunity. Various international organizations assess the macroeconomic data and point out that they are sustained by the dynamic migration. This is what's setting the agenda. And the opposition, in a supreme exercise of irresponsibility, is trying to follow what the far-right dictates, because what they're doing is competing electorally with Vox. [...] I would say to Feijóo that if your rhetoric is like Vox's or if your policies are like Vox's, PP voters, when they have to make a decision, will vote for Vox.

For the welfare state, what does the migration phenomenon represent: a threat, a challenge, or an opportunity?

— What impoverishes our country is the extreme right's way of seeing life and its policies. I don't like to speak only in economic terms, but various organizations have estimated the need for some 300,000 foreign workers each year to sustain our welfare state. And it's a reality that there are more than 3 million foreign Social Security affiliates, another 20,000 in the last month, and 200,000 in the last year. Furthermore, we are an eminently foreign country. Before a Senegalese or a Latin American arrived, our grandparents sought a life abroad, fleeing the war.

Has a dehumanizing debate on immigration been established?

— The fight against hate speech on social media is very important, and the major platforms have taken a step forward and are aware that it is necessary to be much more forceful because it dehumanizes the migrant population, which can spread to society. We saw this this summer in Torre Pacheco. That's why speeches like Feijóo's in Murcia, in which there was not a shred of humanity in a context marked by the genocide in Gaza, are irresponsible.

Together speaks of a feeling of grievance because there are immigrant families who receive lunch scholarships and, on the other hand, families native are excluded. Should Catalonia increase investment in public services and social policies?

— Never before have so many resources been placed in the hands of the autonomous communities so they can assume and address their responsibilities. On migration policy, an important agreement has been reached between the PSOE and Junts, and I find it very positive and noteworthy that an autonomous community wants to take a step forward in assuming certain responsibilities in an issue as complex as migration policy.

But is the talk of grievance justified?

— But, look. Let's look at the housing issue, for example, in Catalonia. There is a state housing law that the autonomous communities must comply with. In Barcelona, ​​specifically, housing prices have dropped by 9% because it has been declared a stressed area. This is a reflection of institutional collaboration to respond to citizens' needs. In contrast, in Madrid, Mrs. [Isabel Díaz] Ayuso is addressing not those who have problems accessing housing, but investment funds, telling them that this is the best time and place to invest. It's important to see different ways of facing reality. And what has to do with the growth in membership also translates to Catalonia. There are more people working, more people who can develop their life plans in better conditions.

What self-criticism should left-wing forces engage in to prevent certain discourses from being imposed?

— I think it's important to analyze the agreement reached between the parties. An agreement that puts it in black and white, beyond discourses that may be shared more or less, or may not be shared at all. This is an agreement that speaks of protecting the vulnerable, of a social contract that grants rights and responsibilities to the entire population, that speaks of human rights, and that speaks of exciting future projects. This is the reality, the agreements that are being reached. And, of course, we must combat the misinformation that could link the migrant population to issues that are not in line with reality.

Are you worried that a party like Aliança Catalana will drag Junts into the far-right?

— What gives me confidence is the migration agreement between the PSOE and Junts. I'm familiar with the text, which has received a lot of opinions, but I don't know if it's been read enough. The Generalitat (Catalan government) and local governments are much more familiar with the productive fabric, the needs of businesses and workers, so it makes sense for them to participate in circular immigration programs with third countries. Or, for example, to facilitate the bureaucratic process with a one-stop shop. These agreements are made to move toward a more effective policy and to put human rights at the center and combat any kind of racism or xenophobia that some people want to instill.

Do you trust Junts not to buy the Aliança framework?

— What seems important to me is the agreement [on the delegation of powers] signed with Junts.

Will they try to bring the delegation of powers back to Congress, or will they look for other avenues?

— Political parties must take a stand. The [Spanish] government will continue working to move forward and fulfill the agreements.

The number of migrants arriving in the Balearic Islands is increasing, and the Balearic government is pointing to a lack of resources. Could a situation like the one in the Canary Islands be a possibility?

— These situations are not at all comparable; the numbers are completely irrelevant. Furthermore, I want to point out that in recent weeks, a significant emergency declaration was approved very quickly, with more than 7 million euros allocated to strengthen and adapt facilities to provide an appropriate response to the Balearic Islands.

I mentioned the events in Torre Pacheco earlier. Is Spanish society racist?

— No. I think it's the far right that's trying to disrupt our coexistence and, with their outlook on life and policies, trying to make us a poorer country socially and economically. But Spanish society isn't racist.

When families are uncomfortable with their children attending school with children of foreign origin, does this reflect a society that is not prepared for demographic change and that, at its core, racism does exist?

— We analyzed the CIS (Central Statistics Institute). A year ago, we asked if migration was a concern, and we saw that the number of people who considered it a concern was significant. On the contrary, when we asked if it concerned them in their daily lives, the number plummeted. Today, a year later, it's only a problem above others for 3.2% of the population. That's why a created concern is not the same as a real concern. When in Jumella (Murcia), the PP and Vox prohibit the use of a sports center for a Muslim celebration, violating freedom of worship, it is disrupting coexistence in a population where there is no problem. I insist on differentiating between a created concern and a real concern.

In Barcelona the so-called grow expatsBut there's no debate from a migration perspective. Is there a class bias?

— Absolutely. We can see it in the case of minors. Since Putin invaded Ukraine, more than 7,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived from the country. All the regions have done their best to welcome them. This hasn't made any headlines, nor has it sparked any controversy, nor has it become politicized. Instead, we're seeing how the PP-led regions are refusing [to welcome other unaccompanied minors]. Furthermore, they're lying because they're trying to convey the narrative that there are communities that aren't included in the reception scheme, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country.

On Thursday, we learned the new membership figures. What jobs are being created?

— Job creation goes hand in hand with quality. Incidentally, in Catalonia, 19% of the workforce is foreign, five percentage points above the Spanish average. We've managed to correct problems in our labor market, and this hasn't come out of the blue. It's the result of implementing policies in the right direction.

The ILP (Proposal for a Legalization of Half a Million Migrants) remains blocked in Congress. Is the Spanish government considering expediting the process through other means?

— It's a task for the political parties. It's in Congress where it should be debated.

A new contribution scheme for the self-employed is being negotiated. Will there be an agreement before the end of the year?

— Yes, I'm optimistic. Meetings are taking place frequently, and all the stakeholders who need to be there are present. Two important issues are on the table: improving access to cessation of activity and issues related to priority.

There's also no agreement on progressive sick pay for workers. This has raised concerns among unions about whether they're buying into employers' narratives about absenteeism. Do you think some workers are taking advantage of sick pay?

— I wouldn't put the focus on workers. Health is the focus, and no one in that country can work while on sick leave. We're putting measures on the table to advance the improvement of rights, and this has to do with this gradual reinstatement once discharged.

How do you ensure that workers are not pressured to return for fear of losing their job?

— A worker cannot work while on sick leave; they can only return to work when they receive a doctor's release. We're talking about a return to work that isn't from zero to one hundred percent, but rather progressive. For example, after a cancer treatment, under medical criteria, a worker can return to work gradually. I insist: medical criteria, voluntary return, and the health of workers are at the heart of the proposal.

Are you confident of closing the deal before the end of the year?

— I am an optimist.

Your predecessor, José Luis Escrivá, said in an interview with ARA that in Spain ""a cultural change is needed to ensure that people work more between the ages of 55 and 75"" and avoid early retirement. Do you agree with this?

— It's important to keep in mind the voluntary nature of decisions, ensuring that they have nothing to do with insufficient pensions. Extending the retirement age or working a few hours and counting them toward your pension, which is what we're talking about, cannot be conditioned on insufficient benefits. That's why it's so important to revalue pensions, guaranteeing security for pensioners and offering voluntary options to also take advantage of senior talent. The way we live, work, and life expectancy have changed.

Regarding the revaluation of salaries. Do you understand why young people are wary when an income agreement is requested and salaries are raised by 2% or 3% and the maximum pension by 8.5%?

— Trying to pit the elderly against their grandchildren is a perverse and dangerous war. Young people should know that many of the policies we are implementing are aimed at them: the minimum wage, extending maternity and paternity leave to 19 weeks... But, evidently, we are committed to guaranteeing this pension revaluation by law. Pensioners don't appear overnight; they are people who have been contributing to the system for 30 or 40 years, and we must provide them with security, social justice, and guarantee their pensions.

Is the Spanish government doing everything it can [in the face of the conflict] in Gaza?

— It's the government in the world that's doing the most to promote the resolution of both states, to achieve peace in Gaza, to demand an end to the genocide, to protect the flotilla through consular and diplomatic work. This is what the Spanish government is doing.",https://static1.ara.cat/clip/b2c87563-f539-419e-b99c-3bfe9cb17f3b_facebook-aspect-ratio_default_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 07:57:57.108392

More than half of Americans disapprove of how the Supreme Court does its job, according to Gallup, with a 65-point gap between how Republicans and Democrats view the conservative-dominated court.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration about 80% of the time, according to a study by professors at Washington University and Penn State.","Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has notched a run of wins at the Supreme Court, which has overturned or stayed multiple lower-court rulings. These emergency rulings, typically brief, unsigned orders, have served to greatly expand the power of the presidency and remove constraints on the executive branch.

Now, as the Supreme Court begins a new term on Monday, the legal basis of these rulings is facing fresh scrutiny. The nine justices, of whom three were appointed in President Donald Trump’s first term, must issue conclusive, reasoned rulings on some of Mr. Trump’s most controversial policies, from emergency tariffs to birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement. The stakes are high for the administration, the contours of U.S. democracy, and for the court itself, which faces searing questions about its political tilt and institutional integrity.

If the emergency docket was a pit stop, the 2025-26 term is when the rubber meets the road.

Why We Wrote This

Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Supreme Court has granted his administration an unprecedented 30 emergency docket rulings. With the new term opening Monday, the justices must now begin to explain the legal reasoning behind their decisions.

“This is an administration in a hurry. It tries to push all obstacles out of its way,” says Joseph Kobylka, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University. He adds, “This is an administration that is incredibly aggressive about advancing executive power.”

The nation’s highest court will be in the spotlight in an era of rising polarization and distrust. More than half of Americans disapprove of how the Supreme Court does its job, according to Gallup, with a 65-point gap between how Republicans and Democrats view the conservative-dominated court. (Gallup found 43% of those it polled in September see the body as “too conservative.”)

Perhaps the biggest question of all is how an unpopular court would muster its own legitimacy to stand up to the president, if his actions were unlawful. And if it does, would it risk seeing its rulings ignored or sidestepped, potentially upending the rule of law it is tasked to uphold?

“The court is terrified of having a head-on confrontation with the executive branch and making an order that the president won’t follow,” says Dan Farbman, an associate professor of constitutional law at Boston College. “What we’re going to see is a balance between the court’s institutional power, how much power it feels like it has, how many powers it’s willing to exert, and [its] legal reasoning.”

There have already been reported instances of noncompliance by the administration with federal court orders, notes Aziz Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago. This implicitly puts pressure on the Supreme Court not to confront the executive, since officials are suggesting they are willing to defy rulings that go against them, he says. But this political pressure makes it all the more important to impose lawful constraints – and to see that they are carried out.

“A world in which the executive threatens something and the court accedes regardless of the legality of the thing in question is just as bad as a world in which the executive doesn’t obey court orders,” says Professor Huq, who teaches constitutional law.

There are different views on whether people should trust the court intrinsically. Some people believe the court should be viewed as legitimate, regardless of its decisions, and others think the court is legitimate only when they agree with rulings, says Professor Huq.

The Supreme Court was viewed “with a large measure of distrust” by state courts before the Civil War, he says. “An interesting contrast today is you have this rumbling distrust coming not from state courts ... but from lower court judges.”

Examining the court’s legitimacy as a legislative check shouldn’t be conflated with whether its decisions are viewed as right or wrong politically, says Thomas Berry, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Constitutional Studies. “Even the justices shouldn’t like the policy outcome of every case they’re deciding, because legal questions are often different from policy questions.”

What is Humphrey’s Executor and why does it matter?

Among the politically charged cases on the docket for this term, which runs through next June, are the firings of commissioners at independent federal agencies. The administration argues that these agencies are part of the executive branch and that board members serve as the president’s pleasure. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, has held that appointees can only be removed for malfeasance and neglect of duty.

Conservative justices have said, however, that this precedent should be revisited. Judicial activists on the right have long sought to defang agencies that they view as overly independent and duplicative in ways that have exacerbated federal government bloat.

“You have a majority of the Supreme Court that pretty clearly disagrees with Humphrey’s Executor but has not yet overruled it,” says Mr. Berry.

The Trump administration has fired senior officials at several independent agencies. One, Rebecca Slaughter, an appointee at the Federal Trade Commission, successfully sued against her removal; her case, which was upheld on appeal, has been accepted by the Court. (Two other board members of independent agencies have asked for their firings to be reviewed.)

A separate employment case concerns Lisa Cook, a governor at the Federal Reserve, whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of improper mortgage documentation. After she sued, a lower court ruled that she should stay in her position; the Trump administration wants the Court to overturn that decision. Analysts say the Supreme Court may be less inclined to lessen the Federal Reserve’s independence, given its stature as a linchpin in the U.S. economy. (Ms. Cook remains in her post; the Court will hold hearings in January.)

Are President Trump’s tariffs constitutional?

Another case with broad economic consequences concerns the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Most of the tariffs imposed on foreign-made goods since January have been under a 1977 Act of Congress that had never been used for this purpose. The White House argues that its declaration of a national emergency under the act allows it to impose global tariffs.

“It’s hard to argue that this isn’t the most important case of the term,” says Mr. Berry. (Cato has filed amicus curiae briefs in federal court contesting the tariffs.)

How the Supreme Court decides the tariffs case, which lower courts have found unlawful, will have practical as well as constitutional implications. Importers have already paid hundreds of billions of dollars to the government that they would seek to recoup if the emergency tariffs are struck down, potentially widening the federal deficit. Administration officials have said they would find other ways to impose tariffs if they lose the case which will be heard in November.

Michael McConnell, a former appeals court judge appointed by President George W. Bush, has compared the tariffs case with a 1952 ruling, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that President Harry Truman couldn’t take control of steel mills to supply armaments for the Korean War. It laid down the principle, Mr. McConnell wrote in a New York Times op-ed, that “even in an emergency, the president cannot take upon himself powers that are granted neither by the Constitution nor by congressional statute.”

If the Trump tariffs are upheld, it would, by contrast, “be a major step toward a presidency that does whatever the president wishes to do,” wrote Professor McConnell, who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University.

What will happen with birthright citizenship?

Perhaps the most controversial, and to many legal scholars the most tendentious, case involves the administration’s efforts to end birthright citizenship. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, states that all persons “born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

In a Jan. 20 executive order, Mr. Trump ordered that children born in the U.S. not automatically qualify for citizenship if their parents are in the country illegally or temporarily. A flurry of lawsuits followed, resulting in nationwide court injunctions against the order. In June, the Supreme Court struck down the use of nationwide injunctions, but didn’t rule on the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship. The justices, however, left the door open to a class action suit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed. Multiple judges subsequently blocked the executive order from taking effect. Last week, the Trump administration asked the court to rule on the merits of its interpretation of the 14th Amendment.

The court ruling on court injunctions was a technical parsing of law that sidestepped the political minefield of who is and isn’t a citizen. But if the court does, as expected, take up the birthright case, it would be a stiff test of the porous divide between law and politics, say legal scholars.

“The court takes great pains, and Chief Justice Roberts has tried to do this in his opinions and public statements, to say the court is not a political entity but a legal entity,” says Professor Kobylka. Its institutional legitimacy rests, in part, on the idea that it’s above politics. But that idea is increasingly challenged both by its partisan tilt and rising public skepticism.

The unprecedented use of the emergency docket by this administration – 30 grants of emergency relief so far – has ratcheted up this tension, says Professor Huq.

In one such emergency ruling, the Supreme Court recently overturned a California district court ruling that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had unlawfully used racial profiling in its dragnet for unauthorized immigrants. In another ruling in July, the justices allowed the administration to proceed with mass firings of federal workers.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration about 80% of the time, according to a study by professors at Washington University and Penn State. By contrast, in the lower federal courts, “you have a mix ideologically of Republicans and Democrats deciding against Trump in about 95% of cases,” says Professor Huq.

Conservatives argue that federal justices in blue states, where many lawsuits are filed, are overreaching by obstructing the Trump administration. Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, has called this a “failed lower court revolt” that threatens the judicial order. He noted that Mr. Trump also faced pushback in his first term from lower-court judges.

“As soon as Trump began his second term, federal judges resumed their skepticism of everything Trump does. But what’s different this time is that the Boston [Brahmin] of the judiciary, determined to save the rule of law, are pushing back against the Supreme Court itself,” wrote Professor Blackman, who serves on a Trump-appointed advisory board on religious liberty.

Other scholars say these cases result from confusion, not defiance: Emergency rulings by the court that overturn federal court decisions, for example, on the removal of agency officials, without formally overturning the 1935 precedent, leave lower-court judges unsure how to apply the law.

Full hearings, followed by formal rulings that supersede the shadow docket, would end this dilemma while also pitching the Supreme Court into the political arena, where it prefers not be.

“Right now, the court’s been able to sort of give the administration a break without having to fully defend itself, to defend its reasons. But when it finally decides these cases, it has to actually write up the reasons for what they’re doing. And that could mean big changes in constitutional law, or it could mean a confrontation with the president,” says Professor Farbman.",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/10/1003_NNEWTERM_LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-10-05 07:58:19.385314

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality.","BOSTON -- A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that President Donald Trump cannot enforce his executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of people in the country illegally or temporarily. The court on Friday joined four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily -- and by extension, their children -- cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats -- both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority -- were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

""The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,"" wrote Chief Judge David Barron. ""It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.""

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to ""being vindicated by the Supreme Court.""

Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211214688_211213090-643b85249e794de5a8af7ec8e3f00dc9_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-05 06:57:25.431134

“Despite repeated outreach from Democratic and Republican committee staff, the Trump administration has completely discarded its legal obligation, leaving Congress in the dark and refugees in limbo,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement; Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee; and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), ranking member for the Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration.

The president effectively suspended the U.S. State Department’s 40-year-old refugee resettlement program on his first day in office. The program requires refugees fleeing conflict, famine, and persecution to pass background checks and medical exams before entering the country, and often involves yearslong waits in refugee camps before they are resettled in the U.S.

“What began as a so-called ‘suspension’ has now stretched into an eight-month shutdown, betraying the nation’s promise as a refuge for the oppressed,” said the Democrats. “Nearly 130,000 people facing persecution abroad who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements of our refugee program have been abandoned by this administration, left to languish in refugee camps around the world after being given the promise of safety and a new life in America.”

But for white South African farmers, also known as Afrikaners, Trump carved out an exception earlier this year that will reportedly be extended into 2026 — allowing them “to skip the line and rigorous vetting as countless others are shut out of the U.S.,” said the Democrats.

Trump and his billionaire megadonor, South Africa-born Elon Musk, have helped spread false claims that the country’s democratically elected Black government has systematically oppressed white Afrikaners, who enforced a racist apartheid system until 1994, and has allowed white farmers to be murdered — saying white people in the country face a “genocide.”

White South Africans hold 20 times the wealth of Black people in the country despite making up just 7% of the population, and control the vast majority of land.

“Poor Black citizens of South Africa are far more likely to be victims of violent crime and murder than white people,” wrote Joe Walsh at Current Affairs last year, noting that during one period, “when there were 49 murders on farms across the entire country, one of Cape Town’s predominantly Black townships called Khayelitsha recorded 179 murders, at a rate of approximately 116 per 100,000 people.”

While Trump plans to open the door to thousands of white South Africans, said Danilo Zak, director of policy at Church World Service, “more than 100,000 refugees from Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, etc., who have been through years of vetting, approved, [are] now left stranded.”

With Trump’s determination on refugee numbers “already signed and dated,” said Zak, it’s impossible for Trump to have completed an “appropriate consultation” with Congress to approve the abandonment of refugees across the world.

Trump previously set a record low number for refugee admissions during his first term, imposing a cap of 15,000 slots for resettlement.

The new plan was reported as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the second time in four months in favor of allowing the president to revoke Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 Venezuelans, putting them at risk for deportation — despite an earlier ruling by a federal judge who found Trump had acted illegally when he moved to revoke TPS.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2199006633.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:57.607782

Iranian state media also reported a sharp increase in returns through the Dogharoon border in Khorasan Razavi province, with officials saying between 2,000 and 3,000 Afghans are crossing back into Afghanistan every day. Amirullah Shamaghdari, the province’s deputy security and law enforcement chief, told IRNA that more than 80 percent of Afghan migrants in the province have already returned this year.

He said over 90 percent of those returns were voluntary, while around 10 percent involved deportations following police identification. Shamaghdari added that June and July saw the highest number of returns and announced that a new biometric registration system at Dogharoon would begin operating next week to track cross-border movement in real time.

IRNA reported that undocumented Afghans identified in 11 Iranian provinces are being sent back through three official crossings — Dogharoon in Khorasan Razavi, Milak in Sistan and Baluchestan, and Mahiroud in South Khorasan.

The surge in deportations from Iran and Pakistan has placed additional strain on Afghanistan, which is grappling with widespread poverty, unemployment and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Aid agencies warn that the influx of returnees is overwhelming border facilities and local communities already struggling to provide basic services.

Many returnees say they face an uncertain future. “There are no jobs, and women are not allowed to study or work,” one returnee told Amu, adding that he had lived in Pakistan for years before being forced to leave.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.

Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organizations. They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa program.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.

Supporters and Critics of H-1B Visas

Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programs say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.

Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.

Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.

Trump in his unprecedented order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.

He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B program have undercut its integrity and that the program threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology. He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B program threatens the country’s economic and national security.

Plaintiffs Argue Trump Overstepped Authority

The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa program and cannot under the U.S. Constitution unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.

“The Proclamation transforms the H-1B program into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.

The groups argue that agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. State Department likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”

H-1B Program Scope and Global Impact

The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees. The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.

India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.

Pope Francis’s openness to the LGBTQ community, advocacy for migrants and critiques of unrestrained capitalism saw him run up against strong conservative opposition inside and outside the church.

Leo, after gently dipping his toe into the US political fray, is now facing criticism from similar quarters to Francis. The opposition is coming from conservative Catholics in the US and MAGA supporters, some of whom, after Leo’s election, had hoped he would take the church in a different direction from Pope Francis.

The first American pope was asked on Tuesday about plans by the cardinal in Leo’s home city of Chicago to give an award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership. Cardinal Blase Cupich, an ally and friend of the pope, was planning to give Durbin a “Lifetime Achievement Award for support to immigrants,” but the move faced a backlash given Durbin’s support for abortion rights. Durbin decided to refuse the honor.

Unusually, around 10 US bishops even spoke out publicly against the award. Two of those who did – Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone and Bishop Thomas Paprocki – were both appointed a religious liberty advisory body by US President Donald Trump and had been at odds with decisions made by Francis.

Rather than condemn the award, Leo said it was important to look at Durbin’s “40 years of service in the United States Senate.” The pope then said that it’s “not really pro-life” to oppose abortion and support the death penalty, while also questioning whether it was “pro-life” to support the “inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States.”

Leo’s comments were immediately criticized. One conservative Catholic described it as “disappointing” and “largely irrelevant”, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh said it was a “terrible answer from Pope Leo” and Jack Posobiec, an influencer who is supportive of Trump, posted on X simply: “Some popes are a blessing. Some popes are a penance.” Joseph Strickland, the outspoken retired bishop of Tyler, Texas, said Leo’s remarks had created “much confusion”.

The day after, however, Leo generated more MAGA opposition when he took part in climate conference where he called for action on protecting the planet and blessed some ice. It all comes during a period when Leo had a private meeting with Reverend James Martin, a leading advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, spoke up against the “pandemic of arms” following the Minnesota school shooting and criticised huge CEO salaries and singling out Elon Musk.

Is the Chicago-born pontiff positioning his papacy as a counterbalance to the Trump administration? Along with his comments about abortion and immigration, he described Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s recent speech to generals as “worrying”.

Elise Ann Allen, who recently interviewed Leo for her biography of the pope for her book “Leo XIV: Citizen of the World, Missionary of the XXI Century,” said Leo does not want to be “anti-Trump”.

“He’s open to helping and dialoguing with him. He wants to be an interlocutor,” she told CNN. “His remarks are aimed at Catholics and what he’s saying is there is a ‘consistent life ethic’. Yes, abortion is wrong but being pro-life respects human dignity in all its forms, whether it concerns the death penalty or immigrants. Being from the United States, Leo is aware that the term ‘pro-life’ is often pigeon-holed into abortion.”

For some Catholics abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, while they question Francis’ decision to update church teaching and make the death penalty “inadmissible.”

Francis’ critics hoped that Leo’s distinct style – such as his decision to wear the red mozzetta cape after his election – might signal a course correction.

“Conservative Catholics had hoped that Pope Francis’ reforms would follow him into the tomb, that the universal church would view his papacy the way they did, as a bit of bad weather that had finally and thankfully passed,” Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic commentator, wrote in the National Catholic Reporter.

This week they were disappointed. Leo has shown he will, like Francis, try and avoid the culture wars. He doesn’t want to fuel any polarization. “They are very complex issues, and I don’t know if anyone has all the truth on them,” the Pope pointed out when asked about Durbin’s award. Leo will also speak up, when necessary, particularly on the treatment of immigrants, an issue close to his heart from his time as a bishop in Peru. While Leo’s aim is to be a peacemaker his intervention this week show he’s unafraid to face opposition when drawing lines on where the church stands.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2238069640.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-04 22:57:12.137644

She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,"" Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Judge: The federal response didn't match the facts

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

White House says it will appeal

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president’s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

Portland protests were small, but grew after deployment was announced

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, filed a lawsuit on Monday fighting the activation of 200 federalized members of the Oregon national guard.
In the restraining order released on Saturday, US district judge Karin Immergut – nominated by Trump – concurred with Oregon’s assertion that Trump deploying federalized national guard troops to Portland would likely inflame rather than calm protests, just as it did in 2020.
Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several US cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis.
Speaking Tuesday to US military leaders in Virginia, the president proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.","A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deploying the national guard to Portland, Oregon, according to court documents.

Donald Trump had announced on 27 September that he would deploy troops to Portland, “authorizing Full Force, if necessary”, ignoring pleas from local officials and the state’s congressional delegation, who suggested that the president was misinformed or lying about the nature and scale of a single, small protest outside one federal immigration enforcement office.

A coalition of 17 mayors in the state had opposed the deployment. Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, filed a lawsuit on Monday fighting the activation of 200 federalized members of the Oregon national guard.

In the restraining order released on Saturday, US district judge Karin Immergut – nominated by Trump – concurred with Oregon’s assertion that Trump deploying federalized national guard troops to Portland would likely inflame rather than calm protests, just as it did in 2020.

The plaintiffs say the deployment would violate the US constitution as well as a federal law that generally prohibits the military from being used to enforce domestic laws.

The stark divide in how the two sides described the situation on the ground in Portland was evident at a Friday court hearing before Immergut.

US Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton said “vicious and cruel radicals” had laid siege to the Portland headquarters of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The decision to send 200 troops – just 5% of the number recently sent to respond to Los Angeles protests – showed restraint, Hamilton said.

Caroline Turco, representing Portland, said that there had been no violence against Ice officers for months and that recent Ice protests were “sedate” in the week before Trump declared the city to be a war zone, sometimes featuring fewer than a dozen protesters.

“The president’s perception of what is happening in Portland is not the reality on the ground,” Turco said. “The president’s perception is that it is world war two out here. The reality is that this is a beautiful city with a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation.”

For years, Trump has promoted an inaccurate narrative that Portland is a “war-ravaged” city with anarchists engaging in chronic chaos. In late September, the president designated antifa as a “major terrorist organization”. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is not a centralized organization in the US but closer to an ideology with a loose network of activists.

“Today’s ruling validates what Oregonians already know: justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed,” Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, said after the restraining order was granted. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. No fires, no bombs, no fatalities due to civil unrest. The only threat we face is to our democracy – and it is being led by President Donald Trump.”

The ruling by Immergut in Portland is a setback for Trump as he seeks to dispatch the military to cities he describes as lawless over the objections of their Democratic leaders.

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several US cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to US military leaders in Virginia, the president proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.","The Conservatives have pledged to deport 150,00 people a year with a Donald Trump-style immigration crackdown.

Kemi Badenoch plans to create a new “Removals Force” modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.

The proposals, which will be set out in more detail as the Tory conference begins on Sunday, will see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

Mrs Badenoch told the Telegraph she “wouldn’t be surprised” if US President Mr Trump “loved” her migration plan, but said she was more interested in the views of people in the UK.

She pledged to stop “silly arguments” about human rights from stopping her doing the “right thing” if she was in No 10.

The new force will be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

In the US, Ice has been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and American citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.

Immigration is to be one of the key themes of the gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system, in which refugee status would be granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants, and saying there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The Tories have said they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if they win the next election, saying the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.

Her party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.

Asked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.

“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/04/22/7939b5b7e4c1471731106187119cbca1Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5Njk4NTY1-2.81876547.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-04 20:56:37.014231

“There was no rationale to detain Bibi Harjit Kaur,” Deepak Ahluwalia, Kaur’s attorney, told American Community Media in a Sept. 24 interview. “It’s all part of their effort to fill beds.”

“Her detention was nothing short of barbaric,” said Ahluwalia. “That type of treatment would affect most people. They chose to do this to a 73-year-old woman with disabilities and health issues.”

The elderly woman was initially taken to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Bakersfield and then transferred to the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Neither her family nor Ahluwalia was informed of the transfer.

No water, harsh conditions

Kaur was not given water to take her medications, according to Ahluwalia. When she asked for water, she was given a plate of ice instead, which she could not chew because of her dentures. In Lumpkin, Kaur was forced to sleep on the floor in a crowded detention facility; she could not easily get up from the floor, as she had surgery on both knees. The strict vegetarian got only meat-based meals for her first six days in detention. She was handcuffed numerous times during transfers.

The Stewart Detention Center is a private ICE detention center operated by CoreCivic.

Kaur — a seamstress who worked at the Berkeley Sari Palace for more than 20 years — had applied for asylum when she first arrived in the U.S. in 1991 with her two young sons, after the death of her husband. Her asylum claim was based on a credible fear of persecution in India. In the 1990s, thousands of Sikhs arrived in the U.S. on asylum claims, stating that they were under threat from the Indian government and the Punjab police after the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguard.

After Gandhi’s assassination, nearly 3,000 Sikhs were killed within days. Many international civil rights organizations have claimed the “anti-Sikh riots” amounted to a genocide. In 2023, California State Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains introduced AJR2 to recognize the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as genocide. The resolution passed the state Assembly and Senate. It did not need Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature; resolutions do not require the governor’s signature. Rep David Valadao, R-California, last October introduced a similar measure in Congress.

Arrested during ICE check-in

Kaur’s asylum case was denied twice: in the last, by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in 2013. She needed travel documents to return to India after her asylum claim was denied, but had not received the necessary paperwork when she was arrested by ICE on Sept. 8 during a routine check-in at the ICE office in San Francisco. Kaur had made the necessary check-ins every 6 months for the past 12 years. Ahluwalia said she had fully cooperated with immigration authorities throughout the lengthy process after her asylum claim was denied.

Kaur’s family was unable to sponsor her for permanent residency, said Ahluwalia. An undocumented resident’s family cannot apply for sponsorship if the person is in the U.S. Kaur would have had to return to India until she was granted a family-based visa, which she could not do because of a lack of travel documents. Kaur’s family could not sponsor her “from within” — while she was still in the U.S., explained Ahluwalia.

“Harjit’s case represents a failure of our immigration system. She has been a contributing member of her community for decades, paying taxes, working legally, and building relationships with neighbors and friends. Her detention is not only cruel but unnecessary.” Family statement

Her family released a statement last week, which read: “Harjit’s case represents a failure of our immigration system. She has been a contributing member of her community for decades, paying taxes, working legally, and building relationships with neighbors and friends. Her detention is not only cruel but unnecessary.”

“She has never refused to return to India but cannot without documents,” noted the family.

India’s consul general responds

Dr. K. Srikar Reddy, the Consul General of India at San Francisco, told ACoM it is the responsibility of ICE to request travel documents for people they are deporting. No such request had been made in the 12 years since Kaur’s asylum claim had been rejected by the 9th Circuit.

“Once ICE requests travel documents, it usually takes just a couple of days for us to issue them. But Mrs. Kaur had migrated more than 30 years ago, so we had no information about her. We had to connect with Indian authorities, which took some time,” said Reddy.

Asked if Kaur faces persecution when she returns to India, Reddy stated: “She was denied by the highest appeals court. That clearly shows that her fears of persecution were unfounded.”

In a statement released to NBC News, ICE defended its deportation of Kaur, noting that she had lost all of her legal remedies several years ago. “ICE is enforcing U.S. law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more U.S. tax dollars,” read the statement.

As of 2022-23, India was the fifth largest source of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., following Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, according to the Pew Research Center. Reddy said he has seen a slight increase in requests for travel documents over the past seven months.

Pritzker said the guard received word from the Pentagon in the morning that the troops would be called up. He did not specify when or where they would be deployed, but President Donald Trump has long threatened to send troops to Chicago.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said in a statement. ""It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to questions about Pritzker's statement.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Illinois follows similar deployments in other parts of the country. Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to help Memphis police.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to stop the deployment in Los Angeles and won a temporary block in federal court. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling that the use of the guard was illegal, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that it believes the government is likely to prevail.

Pritzker called Trump's move in Illinois a ""manufactured performance"" that would pull the state's National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs.

""For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,"" said the governor, who also noted that state, county and local law enforcement have been coordinating to ensure the safety of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago.

Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people protesting Friday near the facility, which has been frequently targeted during the administration's surge of immigration enforcement this fall.

Trump also said last month that he was sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city war-ravaged. But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when demonstrations and unrest gripped the city following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.

City and state officials sued to stop the deployment the next day. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments Friday, and a ruling is expected over the weekend.

On Friday, another federal court delivered a similar verdict.

A unanimous panel of the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston determined that President Trump cannot enforce the order. This decision aligns with four previous court rulings nationwide that have blocked the executive order.

Advt

The US Supreme Court is expected to have the final decision on birthright citizenship, as the Trump administration has already asked the High court for review.

Federal judges have repeatedly noted that the executive order conflicts with both Supreme Court precedent and the Constitution itself. Although the Supreme Court is not bound by the opinions of lower courts or even its own prior decisions, the repeated lower court losses could signal a challenging battle ahead for the administration—even before a Court that has often supported Trump’s policy actions.

The Right to Birthright Citizenship

Birthright citizenship has long been rooted in US law, widely acknowledged as granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868 to guarantee citizenship rights to Black Americans, including former slaves. The amendment’s citizenship clause states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are American citizens.

Lawyers for the administration have maintained that the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” language means that citizenship is not automatically extended to children born in the US unless the children have primary allegiance to the US. Accordingly, they argue, children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visitors, whose allegiance is presumed to lie elsewhere, should not receive automatic citizenship.

Advt

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson stated on Friday that the 1st Circuit’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment is flawed.

However, legal experts point to the amendment’s legislative history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings to refute the administration’s reading. Congressional debate at the time of its adoption shows lawmakers intended a broad birthright citizenship guarantee that included children of immigrants, with the “subject to the jurisdiction” phrase simply meaning subject to US law.

Historically, two groups—children of Native Americans on tribal lands and children of foreign diplomats—were the only exceptions contemplated by the clause.

Supreme Court and Lower Court Rulings

A landmark 1898 Supreme Court case recognized the US-born children of Chinese immigrants as citizens under the 14th Amendment. While the Supreme Court has never squarely ruled on the citizenship rights of children born to undocumented immigrants, a footnote in a 1982 case suggests no distinction between such children and those born to parents in the country legally.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority considered a challenge to the birthright citizenship order, but declined to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it used the opportunity to limit lower courts’ power to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policy—an outcome favorable to the administration.

Numerous lower courts, starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, have blocked the order. The Supreme Court’s June ruling left open the possibility for nationwide orders in class-action and state-led lawsuits.

In recent decisions, judges certified a class of all children born in the US after the order’s effective date who could be denied citizenship. Others found that differing state responses to the order would not relieve its burden, as people frequently move between states and could give birth outside their state of residence.

Since citizenship status determines eligibility for certain government benefits, the affected states would need to overhaul their eligibility systems, according to the decisions by the 9th Circuit and a federal judge in Boston.

The 1st Circuit panel described the issue in clear terms, noting that birthright citizenship is firmly established and questioning the legitimacy of recent efforts to challenge it.

White House Response

White House spokesperson Jackson indicated that the administration remains confident it will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court.

To implement the executive order, officials would require confirmation of parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers or passports, according to recent guidance. AP

A federal judge has granted Oregon's temporary restraining order on the National Guard deployment early Saturday evening.

People gathered around noon at Elizabeth Caruthers Park on South Moody Avenue. The group, which grew to several hundred people, then marched to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility on South Macadam Avenue.

Photos taken of the protesters show some of them holding signs and flowers, and others dressed up in costumes, including one person in a Handmaid's Tale costume.

At one point, a KGW crew saw federal agents use several rounds of some kind of chemical crowd control munitions — such as tear gas, mace and pepper balls — sprayed on protesters outside the ICE facility.

Holly Brown, who helped organize Saturday's protest and said that she's been protesting at the facility over the past months, stepped over the blue line on the ground marking federal property. She, along with two other people, was seemingly detained by federal agents.

Moments later, agents deployed tear gas and mace. KGW also photographed a person who said that they were hit with a pepper ball.

Much of the crowd dispersed in the immediate aftermath. KGW did not witness any violence coming from the side of the protesters.

In a news release, organizers with PDXCD accused Trump of militarizing the city, and also noted the city of Portland issued a land use violation against the ICE facility.

""I think a lot of people are very scared. A lot of people are very nervous. Sending the military after your own citizens is an egregious act,"" said Holly Brown. She said she's also been protesting at the ICE facility over the past few months.

""The people protesting at ICE are completely peaceful,"" Brown added. ""They are people who are going out there to stand up for their immigrant neighbors, and they are being painted in some press outlets and by Donald Trump as agitators, as people who don't belong here who are causing violence, and nothing could be further from the truth.""

FBI data released Thursday claims that they have made 128 arrests since June 9, but KGW has found that many taken into custody are not formally charged; those who have been charged are facing penalties, from trespassing to assaulting a federal officer.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release that federal agents “fired defensive shots” at “an armed U.S. citizen” during routine patrolling.

“Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” McLaughlin stated.

“Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds.”

McLaughlin continued, “The armed woman was named in a @CBP intelligence bulletin last week for doxing agents and posting online ‘Hey to all my gang let’s f–k those mother f—ers up, don’t let them take anyone.’”

The woman was found near 39th Street and Pershing Road and transported in fair condition to Mount Sinai Hospital, Chicago Sun-Times reports, citing Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Merritt.

Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem addressed Saturday’s shooting on X, writing, “Today in Chicago, members of our brave law enforcement were attacked—rammed and boxed in by ten vehicles, including an attacker with a semi-automatic weapon.”

“I am deploying more special operations to control the scene. Reinforcements are on their way. If you see a law enforcement officer today, thank them.”

Noem continued in a follow-up post, “Our brave men and women of law enforcement are being targeted and attacked by violent anarchists who seek to tear down America.”

“I want each and every member of law enforcement to know this: President Trump and I have your backs. Stand with ICE as they continue to protect and defend our homeland,” she said.

Since August, the Trump administration has deployed federal law enforcement to Chicago, citing a disputed rise in crime. ICE enforcement has grown more aggressive, including helicopter surveillance of raids and arrests of local officials and activists who oppose the operations.

Protests against ICE raids have occasionally turned violent as Saturday’s incident follows the fatal shooting of Mexican immigrant Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by an ICE officer in September.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker revealed Saturday that the Department of War gave him an ultimatum.

“Call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said on X, announcing that the Trump Administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,” Pritzker wrote.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/04/20/55/GettyImages-2239016043.jpg?trim=0,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-04 22:57:26.070974

In his 16-page ruling, Crenshaw said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern”, but one stood out.

Ábrego contends that, while imprisoned in El Salvador, he suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture.","A federal judge has concluded that the Department of Justice’s prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation to El Salvador.

The case of Ábrego, a Salvadorian national who was a construction worker in Maryland, has become a proxy for the partisan struggle over Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.

US district court judge Waverly Crenshaw granted a request late on Friday by lawyers for Ábrego and ordered discovery and an evidentiary hearing in Ábrego’s effort to show that the federal human-smuggling case against him in Tennessee is illegally retaliatory.

Crenshaw said Ábrego had shown that there is “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive”. That evidence included statements by various Trump administration officials and the timeline of the charges being filed.

The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to inquiries about the case on Saturday.

In his 16-page ruling, Crenshaw said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern”, but one stood out.

That statement, by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program after Ábrego was charged in June, seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged him because he won his wrongful deportation case, Crenshaw wrote.

Blanche’s ”remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Ábrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights” to sue over his deportation “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct”, Crenshaw wrote.

Likewise, Crenshaw noted that the Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into Ábrego days after the US supreme court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring him back.

Ábrego was indicted on 21 May and charged on 6 June, the day the US returned him from a prison in El Salvador. He pleaded not guilty and is now being held in Pennsylvania.

If convicted in the Tennessee case, Ábrego will be deported, federal officials have said. A US immigration judge has denied Ábrego’s bid for asylum, although he can appeal.

The Salvadorian national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager.

In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the US for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.

The human-smuggling charges in Tennessee stem from a 2022 traffic stop. He was not charged at the time.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Ábrego, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

Ábrego’s attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.

Ábrego contends that, while imprisoned in El Salvador, he suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbc352cfd6786d568196c7d3bd98462980f733b3/947_0_5178_4143/master/5178.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20d9708a691c56f6ccf0a4587ec697f7",N,,2025-10-04 18:56:40.050581

In an earlier iteration of the case, the justices in May agreed to temporarily block a judge’s order to retain the protections.
They characterized the administration’s claim against the lower court judge as a “baseless and dangerous accusation” that did not disregard the earlier Supreme Court order.
Trump administration lawyers defended Noem’s actions and said the statute at issue did not allow such legal challenges.
“This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the Supreme Court has abandoned law for politics,” he said in a statement.","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to lift protections for more than 300,000 Venezuelan immigrants who had been living in the United States without risk of deportation.

It was the second time in four months that the justices had agreed to allow the migrants to be deported.

In an earlier iteration of the case, the justices in May agreed to temporarily block a judge’s order to retain the protections. That order was unsigned and gave no reasons. Only Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

The case then returned to Judge Edward M. Chen of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California, who ruled for a second time last month in favor of the immigrants after reviewing a new claim and receiving additional evidence. Chen said he was not bound by the Supreme Court’s order from May, noting it “did not provide any specific analysis.”

In its brief, unsigned order, the court’s conservative majority said that “although the posture of the case has changed, the legal arguments and relative harms generally have not.” For that reason, the court said, “the same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.”

The three liberal justices noted their dissent, with Jackson sharply criticizing her colleagues for a “grave misuse” of the emergency docket.

The majority, she wrote, has used its power “to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

Jackson accused the majority of wrongly “privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power over countless families’ pleas for the stability our government has promised them.”

While the court’s ruling on Friday is again temporary, it means hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrations are at risk of immediate deportation as litigation continues. After the Supreme Court’s initial order, lawyers for the immigrants said “many thousands of families were torn apart,” Venezuelans who had been protected lost jobs, were jailed and “deported to a country that remains extremely unsafe.”

President Donald Trump has tried to end the protections under the Temporary Protected Status program as part of his aggressive mass deportation efforts.

In asking the Supreme Court to halt Chen’s latest order, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that the judge’s actions were another example of “the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket.”

As long as Chen’s order is in effect, Justice Department lawyers told the court, the Trump administration “must permit over 300,000 Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so even temporarily is ‘contrary to the national interest.’”

The Temporary Protected Status program, enacted by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows migrants from nations that have experienced national disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary instabilities to live and work legally in the United States.

The case began in February, when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem tried to end an 18-month extension of protections for certain Venezuelan migrants that had been granted by the Biden administration.

Immigrants affected by the change challenged the move, saying Noem had exceeded her authority and violated administrative procedures for terminating the program. The Department of Homeland Security failed, for instance, to review the conditions in Venezuela before deciding to end the program, according to lawyers for the immigrants led by Ahilan T. Arulanantham of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.

They characterized the administration’s claim against the lower court judge as a “baseless and dangerous accusation” that did not disregard the earlier Supreme Court order. More broadly, they said, the justices had repeatedly directed lower court judges in other recent cases to ensure government agencies were complying with the relevant statutes.

Trump administration lawyers defended Noem’s actions and said the statute at issue did not allow such legal challenges. They urged the justices to reject what they characterized as a do-over, saying the immigrant advocates “largely recycle legal arguments that previously failed to persuade the court.”

In response to the Supreme Court’s latest order, Arulanantham derided the majority for departing from past practice, including when it allowed lower court judges to block pro-immigrant policies during the Biden administration.

In a move that has sent shockwaves through America’s immigration and employment landscape, President Donald Trump’s administration recently enacted a dramatic increase in work visa fees, requiring applicants to pay an eye-watering $100,000. The announcement, made official by a presidential decree in September, set off immediate alarm bells among employers, advocacy groups, and would-be immigrants. The fallout has been swift, with a coalition of healthcare organizations, religious institutions, university faculty, and other stakeholders filing a class action lawsuit in a San Francisco federal court, according to Bluewin.

At the heart of the legal challenge lies the assertion that the fee hike has “thrown employers, employees, and federal agencies into chaos.” The new policy, critics argue, not only jeopardizes the prospects of skilled foreign workers but also undermines key sectors of the US economy that rely on international talent.

Impact on Employers and Workers

The $100,000 fee applies to the H-1B visa—a highly sought-after route for skilled professionals from around the world to work in the United States. Traditionally, this visa has enabled American companies, from Silicon Valley tech giants to rural hospitals, to fill specialized roles that often cannot be sourced locally. Now, with the cost of sponsorship rising to a level that dwarfs previous requirements, many businesses are left scrambling.

Healthcare providers warn that the fee could exacerbate critical staff shortages, especially in underserved communities already struggling to attract qualified personnel. University administrators fear a chilling effect on academic exchange, research collaboration, and the recruitment of international scholars. Religious groups, many of which rely on foreign clergy and humanitarian workers, see the move as an existential threat to their missions.

“This isn’t just a paperwork issue—it’s a seismic shift in how America engages with the world’s talent,” said an attorney representing the plaintiffs. “It prices out not only individuals, but also the communities and institutions that depend on their expertise.”

Policy Rationale and Political Backdrop

While the administration defends the fee as a measure to “protect American jobs” and deter what it describes as abuse of the visa system, critics see it as part of a broader pattern. In recent months, the Trump White House has taken a series of steps aimed at reshaping immigration policy, from limiting the number of foreign students to proposing tuition freezes at universities that accept federal funding.

The timing is notable: the visa fee hike comes amid a wider budget standoff in Washington, with a partial government shutdown disrupting federal agencies and stoking partisan tension. Some observers suggest the move may be intended to rally the president’s political base ahead of a contentious election season, positioning the administration as tough on immigration and foreign labor.

Yet, the decision has drawn criticism even from some traditional allies in the business community, who argue that it undermines American competitiveness. “We’re shooting ourselves in the foot,” said a spokesperson for a national technology council. “Talent is global. If the US closes its doors, innovation will simply move elsewhere.”

Legal Arguments and Prospects

The class action lawsuit, now pending in San Francisco, argues that the $100,000 fee violates both statutory and constitutional protections. Plaintiffs contend that the administration bypassed required regulatory processes and failed to provide adequate justification for such a steep increase. They also allege that the fee effectively discriminates against smaller employers and nonprofit organizations, who lack the deep pockets of major corporations.

“This fee is not just unprecedented—it’s punitive,” the complaint reads. “It serves no legitimate policy goal and risks doing irreparable harm to America’s economic and social fabric.” Legal experts note that courts have previously blocked or rolled back sudden immigration policy shifts that lacked clear statutory authority or posed disproportionate harm to certain groups.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security has so far declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. The agency is reportedly bracing for a deluge of legal challenges and administrative backlogs as the new fee structure takes effect.

Human Stories Behind the Policy

Beyond the legal filings and political rhetoric, the real impact is felt by individuals caught in the crossfire. For Priya, a software engineer from India with an offer from a US startup, the dream of working in Silicon Valley now seems out of reach. “There’s no way I can afford that kind of money,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking, because I’ve spent years preparing for this opportunity.”

Hospitals in rural areas, already struggling to fill nursing and specialist positions, warn that patient care could suffer. “We rely on international medical graduates to keep our doors open,” explained a hospital administrator in the Midwest. “If we lose that pipeline, whole communities could be left without access to critical services.”

Religious charities, too, face tough choices. “Our mission is to serve those in need, but with these costs, we have to decide between hiring a needed worker or cutting back on food programs,” said a director of a faith-based nonprofit.

Broader Implications for US Immigration Policy

This latest development is part of a larger debate over the future of US immigration. Supporters of a more open system argue that America’s strength lies in its ability to attract and integrate talent from around the world. Opponents, on the other hand, claim that unchecked immigration threatens domestic wages and job security.

The $100,000 fee, whatever its fate in the courts, is already sending a message. Immigration attorneys report a surge in inquiries from clients considering Canada, Australia, or the European Union as alternatives. Universities warn that international applicants are reconsidering their plans, and some companies are quietly exploring options for relocating operations abroad.

“America has always been a beacon for those seeking opportunity,” said a university president. “Policies like this risk extinguishing that light.”

As the legal fight unfolds, one thing is clear: the $100,000 visa fee is more than a bureaucratic hurdle. It is a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle to define America’s values and priorities in an interconnected world. The outcome will reverberate far beyond courtrooms, shaping the nation’s identity—and its place on the global stage—for years to come.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tmpe5nz_l1h.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 18:56:49.876425

“One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon. Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fired defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” McLaughlin said.

No agents were wounded during the incident.

McLaughlin added that the woman allegedly involved in the incident had been named in a CBP intelligence bulletin last week for allegedly doxing agents online.

“Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,” McLaughlin added. “The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

Sources confirmed to Nexstar’s WGN that the woman involved suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was hospitalized in critical condition.

Officials from the Chicago Police Department said officers initially responded to the incident when it came in as a call about a person shot, but were not involved in the incident or its investigation.

According to CPD, officers responded to the scene to document the incident and maintain safety, as well as conduct traffic control for those living and working in the area.

The incident comes after weeks of clashes between protesters and federal authorities as they conduct an immigration enforcement operation dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which focuses on Chicago and Illinois.

The operation has been met with intense scrutiny from state and local leaders as well as community members, including those who make up “rapid response teams,” who have been making their presence known on the streets of Chicagoland.

Despite the pushback, more than 900 arrests have been made in the weeks since the operation began.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP25276537580325-e1759606425489.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-04 17:57:38.754543

Paul SeddonPolitical reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester

The Conservatives say they would task officials with removing 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election.

Under plans unveiled as its annual conference begins, the party has pledged to ban people who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum.

It would also prevent those whose claims are rejected from challenging decisions in the courts, with appeals instead handled by Home Office officials.

Border officials would be instructed to remove people ""within hours or at most a few days"", the Tories say, with a reformed ""Removals Force"" unit seeing their funding doubled to £1.6bn per year.

It comes as Tory activists gather in Manchester for their annual party conference, amid dire poll ratings under leader Kemi Badenoch and questions over how they can head off a potentially existential challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.

In the run-up to the four-day gathering, the party has already said it would end the UK's 75-year membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to thwart asylum appeals, confirming a widely-expected policy shift.

Under the latest proposals, the Home Office's immigration enforcement unit would be rebranded as a ""Removals Force"" and given wider-ranging powers, along with an extra £820m per year the Tories say could be unlocked by closing asylum hotels.

The party says it would give the new unit a ""mandate"" to remove at least 150,000 people each year, totalling 750,000 during the five-year lifetime of a Parliament.

This would include people currently living in the UK illegally, the party says, as well as future illegal arrivals and all foreign nationals convicted of a crime more serious than minor parking or speeding offences.

It would represent around a five-fold increase from the 35,000 migrants who were removed from the UK over the last year - the majority of whom went voluntarily.

'No need for lawyers'

The party says it wanted to take inspiration from the US, where President Trump has handed immigration enforcement officers sweeping new powers to arrest and deport undocumented migrants.

The Tories say they would instruct police forces to check the details of everyone they arrest against biometric borders data, and would be allowed to use facial recognition without informing the public it is in use.

It plans to expand an unspecified ""existing facility"" to detain migrants before they are removed, with a capacity for between 1,000 and 2,000 people.

The party also plans to restrict the grounds for claiming asylum to those facing a threat from the government in their home country, excluding claims from those fleeing conflict or ""less tolerant"" laws on religion or sexuality.

Key to their proposals is a plan to abolish the Immigration Tribunal, which hears challenges to failed asylum claims, handing the appeals process instead to a team of officials within the Home Office.

The Tories also plan to abolish taxpayer-funded legal aid in immigration cases, with a document on the proposals arguing there ""will be no need for lawyers"" because claims would be ""fairly assessed against the criteria"".

ECHR divide

The Conservatives' plan comes after Reform UK made similar pledges over the summer to take the UK out of the ECHR and deport 600,000 migrants within five years if it won power.

Badenoch sought to portray her party's plans as more credible, adding that it was backed by ""comprehensive legal analysis"" in the form of a review by Tory peer and former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar.

""Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival,"" she added.

The Tory move to leave the ECHR creates a key dividing line with the Labour government, which has opted against leaving the treaty but is reviewing how it is applied in UK law.

Labour has also pledged tougher action to deal with small boat crossings over the English Channel, which are set to break record numbers this year.

Labour recently set out plans to lengthen refugees' route to permanent settlement in the UK in a bid to make the country less appealing to migrants, and has negotiated a ""one in, one out"" pilot scheme with France.

Unlike Reform, the Tories are not promising to formally disapply the Refugee Convention, a 1951 treaty that prevents signatory countries from returning refugees to countries where they face serious threats to their life or freedom.

But the party says it would legislate to prevent courts having regard to it in asylum cases, with a pledge to leave if ""activist judges attempt to override Parliament"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8569/live/c19342e0-a14e-11f0-8a00-7f108f799fea.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:14.622292

The Tories say this increase in funding would come from the closure of asylum hotels and ""tackling the wider costs of our out-of-control asylum system"".

Modelled on the ""successful approach"" of the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, this new force would be given ""sweeping new powers"", and over £1bn in new funding.

The pledge is part of the Conservative Party's broad new plans to stop illegal migration to the UK, set to be unveiled by Kemi Badenoch on the first day of their annual conference on Sunday, where reducing immigration and creating ""Strong Borders"" will be one of the key themes.

The new ""Removals Force"" that she will unveil will replace the existing Home Office Immigration Enforcement (IE) and will be given broad new powers, including being able to use facial recognition without warning in order to spot illegal immigrants.

It will be given funding of £1.6bn a year, up from the existing £820 million a year, to increase the number of removals annually from 34,000 to 150,000 - which would represent ""at least 750,000 removals"" across a five-year parliament.

The Tories say this increase in funding would come from the closure of asylum hotels and ""tackling the wider costs of our out-of-control asylum system"".

However, ICE in the US has been heavily criticised by politicians and the public in recent months, with the agency accused of arresting both legal migrants and US citizens and targeting people based on their race.

Expanding the use of live facial recognition technology is also likely to attract criticism from within the Tory party itself, on the grounds of it being a threat to individual freedom and privacy.

Tories to withdraw from multiple conventions

In addition to confirming plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), announced on Saturday, Ms Badenoch will also vow to fully repeal the Human Rights Act, and leave the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.

This, the Tories say, would ""end the legal blocks that allow illegal immigrants, and in some cases foreign criminals, to stay in the UK based on flimsy claims"".

A radical overhaul of the asylum system would see refugee status granted only to those threatened by a foreign government, and those fleeing conflict or ""less tolerant"" laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying ""few people will qualify"".

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Tories accusing solicitors of having ""defrauded"" the UK by ""coaching"" applicants and arguing there is ""no need for lawyers"" as people ""should simply tell the truth about their circumstances"".

'Labour is fixing the Tories' mess'

The plans come as Ms Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank from Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

But the party leader said the plans put forward by Nigel Farage's party are ""nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrivals"".

She also said the Labour government offers ""failed gimmicks"", adding: ""Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis. That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.""

A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""The Conservatives' message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won't apologise, now trust us.

""It won't wash - Kemi Badenoch's party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers' money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

Our ‘stronger borders’ plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.","The Conservatives will pledge to create a new immigration taskforce modelled on Donald Trump’s controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, the Guardian understands.

The party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, is expected to announce the policy on Sunday as the Conservatives heads into their annual conference after a year of historic low poll ratings. The proposed “removals force” will be tasked with deporting 150,000 people a year in a move to tackle illegal immigration.

Badenoch will say that the taskforce would be given £1.6bn and “sweeping new powers” if the Conservatives win the next election. This would include the ability to use facial recognition technology without warning to help identify those eligible for removal from the UK.

Under the plans, the taskforce would be expected to “work closely” with the police. Officers would be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest, Badenoch is expected to add.

Badenoch will say that the Ice model has proved to be a “successful approach” in removing migrants who have illegally entered the US. Ice removed nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of Trump’s second presidency, US media reported. However, it has also faced widespread criticism, both for arresting legal migrants and allegedly targeting people on the grounds of their race.

Immigration is expected to be a key theme of this year’s Conservative conference, which begins on Sunday. The removals force is understood to be a cornerstone of a new “borders plan”, which Badenoch will announce to delegates in Manchester.

Analysis of Home Office figures by the PA news agency shows 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year. This means 2025 is on course to break records for the most arrivals in a single year.

Badenoch will say: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders. That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

She is also expected to announce a radical overhaul of the asylum system as part of her borders plan. She will propose granting refugee status only to those who have been directly threatened by a foreign government. Those who have escaped conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion and sexuality will be excluded, Badenoch will say, adding that “few” people would qualify for asylum under the tightened rules.

She also wants to abolish immigration tribunals, with decisions instead taken directly by the Home Office. There would be limited rights of appeal, which would apply only in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority, it is understood.

The plans would also deny legal aid to those fighting immigration cases. Badenoch is expected to say that lawyers have “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants. Badenoch will argue there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

Badenoch announced on Saturday that the Conservatives would remove the UK from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) if the party regains power at the next election.

She said: “I have not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans and our citizens.”

The Conservative leader faces sustained pressure on immigration from the right of her party as polls consistently show Reform could win the next election, despite the fact it currently has just five MPs. Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage, has promised to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people in its first parliamentary term if it gains power.

Badenoch will tell delegates: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our ‘stronger borders’ plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't say how much migrants would get or when the offer would take effect, but The Associated Press obtained an email to migrant shelters saying children 14 years of age and older would get $2,500 each. Children were given 24 hours to respond.

The notice to shelters from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Families and Children did not indicate any consequences for children who decline the offer. It asked shelter directors to acknowledge the offer within four hours.

ICE said in a statement that the offer would initially be for 17-year-olds.

""Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin,"" ICE said. ""Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option.""

ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department did not immediately respond to questions about the amount of the payment and age eligibility.

ICE dismissed widespread reports among immigration lawyers and advocates that it was launching a much broader crackdown Friday to deport migrant children who entered the country without their parents, called ""Freaky Friday.""

The administration has also offered $1,000 to adults who voluntarily leave the country. Advocates said $2,500 may prevent children from making informed decisions.

""For a child, $2,500 might be the most money they've ever seen in their life, and that may make it very, very difficult for them to accurately weigh the long-term risks of taking voluntary departure versus trying to stay in the United States and going through the immigration court process to get relief that they may be legally entitled to,"" said Melissa Adamson, senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law.

Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, echoed concerns about the offer, saying it ""pressures children to abandon their legal claims and return to a life of fear and danger without ever receiving a fair hearing.""

U.S. border authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021. A 2008 law requires them to appear before an immigration judge before being returned to their countries.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters since the Trump administration put them under closer scrutiny before releasing them to family in the United States to pursue their immigration cases.

The additional scrutiny includes fingerprinting, DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers. Over the summer, immigration officers started showing up and arresting parents.

Pritzker said the guard received word from the Pentagon in the morning that the troops would be called up. He did not specify when or where they would be deployed, but President Donald Trump has long threatened to send troops to Chicago.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said in a statement. ""It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to questions about Pritzker's statement.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Illinois follows similar deployments in other parts of the country. Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to help Memphis police.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to stop the deployment in Los Angeles and won a temporary block in federal court. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling that the use of the guard was illegal, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that it believes the government is likely to prevail.

Pritzker called Trump's move in Illinois a ""manufactured performance"" that would pull the state's National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs.

""For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,"" said the governor, who also noted that state, county and local law enforcement have been coordinating to ensure the safety of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago.

Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people protesting Friday near the facility, which has been frequently targeted during the administration's surge of immigration enforcement this fall.

Trump also said last month that he was sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city war-ravaged. But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when demonstrations and unrest gripped the city following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.

City and state officials sued to stop the deployment the next day. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments Friday, and a ruling is expected over the weekend.

If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants.

Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities.

The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues.

The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities.

In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.

The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.

More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were 3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report.

Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor.

CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mohave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield.

A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter.

“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.

She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters.

Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.

Counties reviewing inspection law

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service.

Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections.

The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”

California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.

ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center.

MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City.

California has seven immigration detention centers

All of the facilities are located in Southern California: Three in Kern County, two in San Bernardino County, one in Imperial County and one in San Diego County.

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary.

As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles.

It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature.

GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.

“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.”

“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

Adelanto cleared county review

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports.

San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows.

“Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.

Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.

Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.

An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility.

During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.

“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”

A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care.

“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity. Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”

California tried to ban for-profit detention

The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility.

State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.

Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional.

Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do. The authority rests more with the federal government, particularly Congress,” he said.",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092225_CalCity-Detention_MV_CM_16-Large.jpeg?fit=1280%2C853,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:29.007606

Australia is awash with political rhetoric about “mass immigration.” Headlines, parliamentary speeches, and public commentary insist the nation is being “flooded” with arrivals. Yet the statistics do not bear this out. Immigration intake numbers fluctuate, but the dominant trend of the past decade has not been runaway growth — it has been the unprecedented expansion of deportations. Under the Migration Act 1958 and specifically its notorious section 501 provisions on “character grounds,” deportations have reached historic highs.

From the turn of the century to 2014, only around 40–60 people per year were deported; today, the figure routinely reaches into the hundreds and at times exceeds 1,000 annually. This is not immigration at all — it is exclusion, expulsion, and destruction of lives.

At the heart of this practice is a policy choice: to allow ideologues and ministers unchecked discretion to brand people – often long-term residents – as unworthy of remaining in the only home they know. These decisions are not about protecting the community from imminent danger. They are about the systematic use of “character” as a weapon, eroding the principle that punishment ends when a sentence is served.

This article examines the legislative framework, the expansion of deportations, the case law that has sought (and often failed) to constrain ministerial power, and the profound human cost. It will highlight the advocacy of myself, and in the past, Julian Burnside, David Manne, George Newhouse and Claire O’Connor and others in exposing this injustice, and argue that Australia’s deportation regime is both unlawful in spirit and inhumane in practice.

Section 501 of the Migration Act: A legislative overview

Section 501 of the Migration Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs (or their delegates) to refuse or cancel a visa if the holder does not pass the “character test.”

The test is notoriously broad. A person fails it if they have:

a substantial criminal record (defined to include a prison sentence of 12 months or more);

an association with a group or person suspected of criminal conduct;

or where the Minister reasonably suspects the person is not of “good character” and cancellation is deemed in the national interest.

What is extraordinary is not only the breadth of these grounds, but the fact that the Minister can personally intervene to cancel visas without affording the usual merits review. This “God power,” as critics call it, creates a zone of unfettered executive authority.

Originally, deportations under s 501 were rare. The section was framed as a safeguard for extraordinary cases. But since 2014, following legislative amendments and political focus on “tough on crime” posturing, it has been weaponised into a routine tool of banishment.

The numbers: From dozens to thousands

The contrast is stark. In 2013, deportations under s 501 numbered fewer than 60. By 2015–16, following policy hardening, deportations surged past 1,000 in a single year. Every year since has seen hundreds expelled. This is not a blip, but a structural shift. Australia is now one of the most aggressive deporting nations in the world relative to population size.

These numbers matter because they undercut the myth of “mass immigration.” Net migration figures are misleading when used in isolation. Yes, people arrive, but thousands are simultaneously being removed — many of whom have lived virtually their entire lives in Australia. Deportation is thus not the management of borders. It is the forced re-drawing of personal lives, the destruction of families, and the destabilisation of communities. Many arrive on short-stay visas, study visas, and when they conclude their stay, they return home.

Deportation as extra-judicial punishment

The legal and moral problem is profound: deportation under s501 punishes people twice.

Take a person convicted of an offence. They are tried by an Australian court, sentenced according to law, serve their time, and are released. That should be the end of the matter. The rule of law requires finality. Yet s501 allows the Minister to impose a further, indefinite penalty – banishment from the community – based on the very conviction that has already been dealt with.

This constitutes an extra-legal punishment, untethered from judicial oversight. As the Federal Court recognised in Moana v Minister for Immigration (2015), cancellation powers under s501 are administrative, not judicial. The effect is quasi-penal, undermining the separation of powers and the integrity of sentencing.

The High Court in Minister for Immigration v Nystrom (2006) upheld the validity of deporting long-term residents, but the dissenting voices warned that the practice flouted basic fairness. Critics argue that it creates a two-tier justice system: citizens who are punished once, and non-citizens who are punished twice.

The ideology of “character”

What does it mean to fail the “character test”? The definition is circular and vague. The Minister may “reasonably suspect” a person is of bad character. But suspicion is not proof, and “bad character” is not a legal offence. It is a political judgment.

The use of character grounds is particularly egregious when applied to those with minor or historical convictions. People who migrated as children, grew up in Australia, and committed offences in youth are stripped of visas despite decades of rehabilitation. This is not about risk management—it is about moral condemnation.

As I have constantly argued, the redeemer principle is at stake: the possibility of redemption is essential for a humane society. If people are forever branded as “bad character,” rehabilitation becomes meaningless. Deportation extinguishes the very possibility of return to community, of repair, of belonging.

Case law and judicial review

Courts have grappled with s 501 cases, but the jurisprudence shows the breadth of ministerial power.

In Hands v Minister for Immigration (2018), the Federal Court found the Minister had failed to properly consider the best interests of children when cancelling a visa.

In Aldous v Minister for Home Affairs (2020), the Court emphasised that decision-makers must engage with international human rights obligations.

Yet in many cases, including Falzon v Minister for Immigration (2018), the High Court upheld broad ministerial discretion.

This patchwork of authority illustrates the limits of legal challenge. While procedural fairness must be observed, the substantive power to deport remains largely intact. It is a system stacked against those facing removal.

The High Court’s decision in Love v Commonwealth (2020) introduced a small but significant limitation. In Love, the Court held that First Nations Australians, as members of political communities with deep and continuing connection to country, cannot be considered “aliens” under s 51(xix) of the Constitution.¹⁵ While the case did not involve deportations under s 501 directly, it highlights the boundaries of the aliens power and underscores that Parliament’s capacity to expel people is not unlimited. More recent Federal Court challenges, such as Tesoriero v Minister for Home Affairs (2021), have tested whether ministerial discretion has been lawfully exercised. Yet, despite scattered victories, the overall trajectory has been judicial deference. The courts have shown reluctance to intrude upon the executive’s claimed prerogative to decide who belongs.

Advocacy and human resistance

Alongside the legal battles stands a history of extraordinary advocacy.

George Newhouse and Claire O’Connor were central in the defence of Cornelia Rau, a stateless German-born Australian resident wrongly detained under migration powers in 2004–05. The case became emblematic of the cruelty and dysfunction of immigration detention, sparking the Palmer and Comrie reports. Their work revealed the dangers of unchecked executive power in migration law, which continue today under s 501 deportations.

David Manne’s work has been similarly vital, particularly through the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre (RILC), where he has defended asylum seekers against refoulement and unlawful detention. Julian Burnside KC has fought landmark refugee cases, from Tampa through to multiple High Court challenges, insisting on the centrality of human dignity and international law.

And in recent years, I have been at the forefront of resisting deportations under s501, averting removals in numerous cases. The successful advocacy in the matters of Robert Taylor and Stephen Pokrywka, both covered in ABC News, revealed how deportation tears apart long-standing Australian residents. In another case, that of Ian Orario, I won a decisive victory in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, securing protection against unjust removal. I have succeeded with 23 individuals from 25, avoiding deportation and in securing their liberty from immigration detention. These interventions underscore how individual resistance can temporarily blunt systemic brutality. Yet they also show the limits: for every victory, hundreds of deportations continue.

Human cost: Families and communities shattered

Behind every statistic is a family torn apart. Deportations often target individuals who arrived in Australia as infants or children, never formalised citizenship, and know no other country. To send them “back” is a misnomer — many have no connection to their birth country, no family there, no language skills, no cultural ties.

Communities lose fathers, mothers, siblings. Children are left behind. The trauma reverberates across generations. Deportation is not just a legal act — it is a social wound.

Advocates such as I, George Newhouse, Claire O’Connor, David Manne, and Julian Burnside have fought tirelessly to stop removals, often succeeding in isolated cases. But systemic reform is needed. Without legislative change, each victory is temporary, each reprieve fragile.

International law and human rights

Australia is a party to numerous international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 12 guarantees the right to liberty of movement, and Article 17 protects against arbitrary interference with family life. Deportations under s 501 regularly breach these obligations.

The UN Human Rights Committee has repeatedly criticised Australia’s deportation practices. It has noted that deportations of long-term residents amount to arbitrary expulsion, especially when individuals have served their criminal sentences.

Australia’s Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) obligations also intersect with deportation policy. Forced removals often involve detention in harsh conditions, raising serious questions about compliance with anti-torture norms.

Political rhetoric versus reality

The fixation on “mass immigration” is a distraction. Politicians gain mileage by stoking fear of influx, yet the reality is that deportations outstrip arrivals in significance for many communities. The narrative is one of control, toughness, and deterrence.

But at what cost? The moral panic about immigration blinds the public to the human rights crisis unfolding in plain sight. Deportations are sold as protection of the community, when in fact they fracture it.

Toward reform: Restoring justice

What is needed is wholesale reform of s501. Options include:

Limiting the character test to serious, ongoing threats, rather than historical convictions.

Restoring judicial oversight, ensuring that deportation decisions are made in courts, not ministerial offices.

Introducing a tenure-based protection: those who have lived in Australia since childhood should not be deported under any circumstances.

Embedding international human rights standards into domestic law, ensuring that family unity and proportionality are central.

The principle of redemption must be restored. A society that denies people the chance to rebuild after mistakes is a society without compassion.

There is no mass immigration in Australia. There is mass deportation. I challenge anyone to sit down with me, face the public record and community reckoning, and we discuss the immigration numbers, disaggregate. The record will demonstrate permanent migration at levels below or as required to continue procuring Australia’s annual double trillionaire economy. However, the record on deportations is a gross disgrace. Record numbers of people – many raised here, many rehabilitated – are being expelled under a draconian interpretation of s501 of the Migration Act. This is extra-judicial punishment, contrary to the rule of law, destructive of families, and corrosive of human dignity.

The rhetoric of “bad character” disguises the truth: deportation is not about safety. It is about exclusion, othering, and political gain. The advocates who resist it – Gerry Georgatos, George Newhouse, Claire O’Connor, David Manne, Julian Burnside – illuminate a better path, one grounded in humanity, legality, and justice.

Australia must confront the truth: a just society does not cast out its most vulnerable. It redeems them.

The Portland Police Bureau arrested two people at the protest for allegedly blocking the street from vehicles passing through. Earlier in the evening, federal law enforcement agents detained an individual after they allegedly stepped onto the ICE facility property.

KOIN 6 News crews were on the scene outside the federal building on South Macadam Avenue, where protests continued, as the threat looms of President Trump deploying Oregon National Guard troops in the coming days.

According to witnesses, a protester had crossed the blue line, indicating they were stepping on federal property, after which about 10 federal law enforcement agents ran after them across the street and tackled the person. The person was then taken behind the gate and into the ICE facility building.

In a separate incident later on in the night, Portland police arrested two people for allegedly blocking neighborhood traffic on South Bancroft Street after giving the crowd multiple warnings to clear the street for traffic, according to the PPB Events Messages X account.

Police said the two were also seen engaging in aggressive behavior towards each other in the street and both were using sound amplification devices. They were booked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on charges of second-degree disorderly conduct. Additionally, one was in possession on a can of bear spray and a collapsible metal coil baton, officials said.

This comes after a tense protest outside the ICE facility took place on Thursday night, in which federal agents deployed pepper balls and pepper-spray at protesters. That same night, three people were arrested, including a prominent right-wing influencer, by the Portland Police Bureau for allegedly getting into physical fights.

Portland Police Association President Sgt. Aaron Schmautz told KOIN 6 News that PPB’s role during protests is very different than that of federal law enforcement agents, noting PPB officers do not engage in the enforcement of immigration laws.

“So, everything that we do, all our entire crowd control response is born out of the events of 2020. Specifically, the DOJ, we have a consent decree. They instructed and informed a lot of that,” Schmautz said.

Portland police now use officers in white shirts, known as community liaison officers.

“We have liaison officers who are specifically assigned to be present to kind of help navigate who might help, but they are also not there specifically to engage or run into or investigate crime.”

PPB also has officers on bikes and others patrolling on foot during protests, though they may not make their presence known. All of this is in the name of keeping the peace, Schmautz said.

“Every single person who puts a uniform on does it with the desire to serve their community. They’re doing their level best. There’s new information and very confounding circumstances. But it is just an incredibly untenable situation,” Schmautz said.

After the individual was arrested by federal agents outside the ICE facility on Friday night, the incident appeared to upset other people at the demonstration. Randall Blazak, a sociologist and part of Cure PNW, is part of a group that comes to the demonstrations every week to teach people de-escalation skills in what can be a highly contentious environment.

“Part of this has been teaching de-escalation skills, giving people skills in the protest movement and as well as with the police to help sort of bring things down when the tensions get high, because people get very emotional,” Blazak said.

On Friday, there were many different groups outside the federal facility, not just anti-ICE protesters. There appeared to be counter-protesters, as there was on Thursday night, as well as different people in media documenting what’s happening, and people from around the state just observing what’s happening.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/Federal-agents-arrest-a-protesters-outside-the-Portland-ICE-facility-on-Friday-October-3-2025-KOIN3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:53.594262

Portland police said they arrested two people Friday night. They said those two people were blocking the street. The two men were seen yelling at each other before they were arrested.

One was a self-described video blogger, and the other was a Trump supporter.

Earlier in the day, federal officers chased down a protester, tackled him and sprayed pepper spray in his face. They carried him into the ICE facility. The protester was seen jumping over a line and onto federal property.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment Friday about the arrest and the use of pepper spray.

The arrests came during a tense day outside the facility in South Portland.

Earlier Friday, President Donald Trump’s spokesperson said that . Trump on Sunday authorized mobilizing 200 members of the National Guard to guard federal buildings, including the ICE facility, in Portland.

Friday’s announcement came after Portland police arrested , Nicholas Sortor, on Thursday night. Authorities accused him of disorderly conduct in connection with a fight outside the ICE building.

Meanwhile, this weekend on a request from Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield for temporary restraining order to block the National Guard deployment. Rayfield argues the deployment is unlawful and unwarranted.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have pushed back on the assertion the National Guard is needed.

The deployment of the National Guard has not yet been seen in Portland.

The crowd outside the ICE facility on Friday night was larger than those seen since Monday.

There were also more conservative protesters at the facility, which led to some confrontations between them and anti-ICE protesters. But otherwise, it was peaceful.

There was also a bigger law enforcement presence in the air and on the ground. Federal officers launched a drone, and a helicopter circled the area.

Portland Police Bureau spokesperson Sgt. Kevin Allen told KATU in an email that the police bureau continues to monitor the protest.

The court on Oct. 3 paused a federal judge's September ruling that the administration hadwrongly ended a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States amid perilous conditions back home.

The high court also sided with the administration at an earlier stage in the case. In May, the justices lifted a California federal judge's temporary order, keeping the program in place while the case is litigated.

In a brief, unsigned order, the court on Oct. 3 said that while the posture of the case has changed, the legal arguments and balance of potential harms to both sides have not.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the court said.

The court’s three liberal justices said they would have rejected the administration’s request.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissenting opinion, called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“Because, re­spectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous, and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent,” she wrote.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said that the lower courts were disregarding the Supreme Court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said when asking the court in September to pause the judge’s ruling. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision did not explain why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said the courts nowhave more evidence to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security had run a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

“This case is about whether a federal agency acted outside the scope of its delegated authority and contrary to the procedures Congress required it to follow,” lawyers for the advocacy group and the Venezuelans challenging the administration’s actions told the Supreme Court.

The lawyers also said the court should let the appeals process play out before intervening since the justices didn’t get involved during the Biden administration when a judge temporarily halted some of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.

""Our presence here is not an emergency, no matter what the government says,"" said one of the Venezuelans, identified as M.H., who is married to a U.S. citizen and has two children.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

When the Supreme Court, in May, allowed the administration to end deportation protections temporarily, thousands of families were torn apart, lawyers for the National TPS Alliance told the Supreme Court in September.

We vehemently disagree with those who take a hard line on deporting undocumented immigrants, but it’s not an unreasonable position.","The Trump White House has a simple — and dishonest — explanation for why the government is shut down: Democrats are demanding free health care for undocumented immigrants.

Senate Democrats have “shut down the government,” said Vice President JD Vance during a White House briefing on Thursday, “because we won’t give billions of dollars to health care funding for illegal aliens.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson put out a statement with the wordy title, “Democrats are Choosing Health Care for Illegal Aliens over American Troop Pay, Nutritional Assistance for Women, Infants, and Children.”

In a bizarre and bigoted AI video posted on Trump’s X and Truth Social feeds — and since boosted by the White House’s X account — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is shown wearing a sombrero and a mustache. Next to him is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who, in a fake voice, says everyone hates Democrats and that’s why the party wants to give undocumented immigrants free health care, so “they can vote for us.”

Of course, none of this is true. But it’s par for the course with this White House.

Since Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has employed one dehumanizing and racist attack after another against undocumented immigrants. They have called immigrants an invading force, depicted them as bloodthirsty criminals and described them in terms that cross the line into dehumanization.

As Johnson and Vance are undoubtedly aware, undocumented immigrants cannot purchase federal health insurance plans. They’re not eligible for Medicaid, and they are prohibited from purchasing subsidized health care coverage via Obamacare.

In reality, Democrats are pushing to extend Obamacare tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year and also roll back Medicaid cuts that were included in the Republican tax cut bill, enacted in July. But not only has the White House continued to make these false claims, Vance’s comments on Thursday went a step further, far beyond the pale.

According to Vance, “If you’re an American citizen and you’ve been to the hospital in the last few years, you’ve probably noticed that wait times are especially large and very often somebody who’s there in the ER is an illegal alien. Why do those people get health care benefits at hospitals paid for by American citizens?”

Most Americans could answer this question rather easily.

Denying emergency care to someone with a life-threatening condition, simply because they are an “illegal alien” — or for any reason — is morally abhorrent.

Vance also ridiculed Democratic claims that they aren’t looking to cover undocumented immigrants by pointing to a program in New York state to allow undocumented immigrants over the age of 65 to purchase health insurance. Never mind that this is a program paid for with state, not federal dollars, but what kind of a person — particularly one who calls themselves a pro-life Catholic — opposes letting senior citizens buy health insurance?

Vance is not alone in his inhumanity. When asked if emergency rooms should check immigration status before treating a dying patient, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “That’s a question for health care professionals and legal experts to answer.”

To be clear, there is a very specific legal answer — and quite obvious moral response — to the question posed to Leavitt.

Hospitals are required by law to provide lifesaving care to anyone who enters an emergency room. It’s a provision of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which was signed into law by the original “Make America Great Again” Republican president, Ronald Reagan, in 1986.

The Medicaid program reimburses hospitals that provide emergency care. This is not health care coverage for “illegal aliens.” Instead, it is meant to defray the costs of providing care for anyone who enters the ER, whether they are undocumented migrants or Americans without health insurance.

But forget the law. Leavitt also calls herself a devout Catholic and often leads the White House press team in a daily prayer. The key constituency of Donald Trump is evangelical, “pro-life” Christians. One might expect both to support the preservation of life above all else. But as is so often the case with those who work for this White House — and many who support it — crude, cynical and heartless politics trumps all else.

You don’t have to take my word for it.

Consider, for example, the words of Pope Leo XIV. Earlier this week, he was asked about the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago’s decision to present a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin (Pope Leo is originally from Illinois). The Archdiocese’s move has sparked controversy because Durbin supports abortion rights and, of course, the Catholic Church is adamantly opposed to abortion.

According to Leo, “Someone who says ‘I’m against abortion’ but says ‘I’m in favor of the death penalty’ is not really pro-life. So, someone who says that ‘I’m against abortion, but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”

Imagine if someone asked Leo about the pro-life bona fides of someone who questions providing potentially lifesaving health care.

Not surprisingly, Leavitt pushed back on the pope’s comments, saying she rejects the idea that “illegal immigrants” are receiving “inhumane treatment … under this administration.” But when members of the Trump administration are complaining that “illegal aliens” are receiving lifesaving emergency care or using the bogeyman of undocumented immigrants receiving health care coverage as a cynical political talking point, the inhumanity is evident to all.

Americans do not see eye to eye on immigration. Plenty of Americans share my view that immigration — even illegal immigration — is a net positive for America, both economically and culturally. We vehemently disagree with those who take a hard line on deporting undocumented immigrants, but it’s not an unreasonable position. One can look at the same issue and fail to see eye to eye.

But what shouldn’t be in disagreement is that the millions of undocumented migrants who reside in the United States deserve a modicum of respect and basic humanity. They are not less human simply because of their legal status.

However, that is precisely the position taken by the Trump administration and its supporters. The repeated dehumanization of undocumented immigrants, which has become so routine that it is hardly even remarkable anymore, is a stain not just on the White House but on America. We can and should be better than this.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CtyQiWmmlOEclsNJaYcDkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/b6955d7c9cf569a49f8ea667ec16594e,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:33.407930

The Department of Homeland Security has begun targeting unaccompanied children in the immigration system with what they call a “voluntary option” to return to their countries of origin. Lawyers told LAist they are deeply concerned the program will result in children waiving their rights to see an immigration judge before being removed from the country.

What we know so far: Unverified reports spread through social media and immigration rights advocate circles Thursday suggested ICE was planning to offer unaccompanied children in the immigration system 14 years and older $2,500 in return for waiving their rights to see an immigration judge.

A spokesperson for DHS acknowledged the new program in a social media post today.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” the DHS account wrote, also referencing an option for “access to financial support when returning home.”

What lawyers are saying:

“[The offer is] problematic because they are giving up their opportunity to be before a judge,” said Yasmin Yavar, deputy director for the American Bar Association’s Children’s Immigration Law Academy. Yavar added that children may not understand the consequences of that choice.

Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, legal services director at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told LAist in an emailed statement that they represent hundreds of unaccompanied children and that the $2,500 incentive “has the potential to exploit their unique vulnerabilities as unaccompanied minors in government custody.”

The Department of Homeland Security has begun targeting unaccompanied children in the immigration system with what they call a “voluntary option” to return to their countries of origin.

Lawyers representing children who entered the country apart from their immediate family have told LAist they are deeply concerned about the program because it appears children will be asked to waive their rights to see an immigration judge before being removed from the country.

This effort by DHS comes after the department attempted earlier this year to stop funding a program to provide legal support to children in the immigration system. All funding to the program was halted in March but ordered by District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín to resume in April in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and federal policies. Last month, 76 undocumented minors were nearly flown to Guatemala in the middle of the night, before the deportations were stopped by District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.

Representatives for DHS and HHS have not immediately responded to LAist’s requests for comment.

What we know so far

Unverified reports spread through social media and immigration rights advocate circles Thursday, citing supposedly leaked information about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement action called “Operation Freaky Friday” set to begin today.

The reports suggested ICE was planning to send “offer” letters to unaccompanied children in the immigration system 14 years and older, where they would be promised $2,500 in return for waiving their rights to see an immigration judge.

It was also claimed that if children refused the offer they would be detained upon turning 18 and their family members living in the U.S. would also be arrested. Plans to threaten detention or arrest have not been independently verified by LAist.

In a social media post today, a spokesperson for DHS denied the name of the operation, saying that it was made up by “anti-ICE activists,” but acknowledged that there is now a program in place that is similar in some regard to what was shared in the unverified reports.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” the DHS account wrote, also referencing an option for “access to financial support when returning home.”

Unaccompanied children are required to be transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee and Resettlement, known as ORR, shortly after they are detained by DHS according to a legal settlement made by the federal government in 1997.

In an email from HHS to legal service providers that was shared with LAist, HHS confirmed that DHS will provide $2,500 to undocumented children 14 years or older who take the offer, excluding minors from Mexico or those who have left their custody.

What lawyers are saying

Yasmin Yavar, deputy director for the American Bar Association’s Children’s Immigration Law Academy, told LAist that children who take this offer could end up waiving their rights.

“[The offer is] problematic because they are giving up their opportunity to be before a judge,” Yavar said, adding that children may not understand the consequences of that choice.

Yavar said that children who are detained and in the custody of ORR are supposed to get a “Know your Rights” presentation and be able to consult with an attorney to provide information about their rights and responsibilities.

Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, legal services director at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told LAist in an emailed statement that they represent hundreds of unaccompanied children and that the $2,500 incentive “has the potential to exploit their unique vulnerabilities as unaccompanied minors in government custody.”

The DHS social media post defended the move saying many unaccompanied children had no choice in coming to the U.S. and would be returning to family outside the country.

Multiple lawyers who spoke to LAist said that unaccompanied children commonly live with family in the U.S., and that federal regulations direct ORR to prioritize releasing children to parents or immediate family members in the country while they go through immigration court.

He said Abrego was entitled to obtain further evidence from the government and have a hearing to decide whether the case should be dismissed.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville, Tennessee, cited statements administration officials made celebrating the charges brought against Abrego as evidence the indictment may have been pursued in retaliation for a lawsuit he brought in Maryland challenging his wrongful deportation.

Crenshaw pointed to “remarkable statements” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche made on Fox News that prosecutors started investigating Abrego after a judge in Maryland questioned his removal and found the government “had no right to deport him.”

Blanche during the June 6 interview said Abrego was not returned to the United States “for any other reason than to face justice.”

Crenshaw said those statements could directly establish that the motivations for Abrego’s charges stem from the exercise of his rights to bring suit against the administration over his deportation, “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct.”

Federal law allows for the dismissal of criminal charges if a judge determines they were brought to punish someone for exercising their due process rights. Such requests rarely succeed.

But Crenshaw, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, said Abrego had carried his burden of showing he was likely vindictively prosecuted. He said Abrego was entitled to obtain further evidence from the government and have a hearing to decide whether the case should be dismissed.

Representatives for Abrego and the Justice Department declined to comment.

Abrego, a native of El Salvador who had been living in Maryland, was deported and imprisoned in El Salvador in March despite a 2019 judicial ruling that he could not be sent there because of a risk of gang persecution.

Abrego challenged that deportation in a civil lawsuit before a federal judge in Maryland. The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld an order from the Maryland judge that the Trump administration facilitate Abrego’s return.

In June, Abrego was returned to the U.S. after prosecutors secured an indictment in Tennessee accusing him of transporting migrants in the U.S. illegally as part of a smuggling ring. Abrego has pleaded not guilty and has disputed that he was a gang member.

The most contested is known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S.

The latest volley at the decades-old program came late Friday, when in a brief, unsigned order, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the government to lift the form of protection for Venezuelan immigrants, ultimately leaving some 600,000 people at risk of deportation by November.

The T.P.S. program allows foreign nationals to stay in the U.S. for about 18 months when circumstances such as natural disasters or armed conflict make returning to their home countries unsafe. But the initiative has become all but permanent for people from some nations that have continued to be unstable for many years, such as Haiti and until recently, Syria.

Critics of the program such as Mr. Trump say that has made it ripe for exploitation. But immigrant and refugee advocates say that this form of immigration relief has become one of the few paths to safety for people in an outdated and overburdened immigration system that Congress has failed to adapt to the modern challenges of global migration.

Now, a wave of litigation from coast to coast has plunged hundreds of thousands of people — as well as their employers and families — into uncertainty over whether they can maintain the work permits and deportation protections under the program and for how long. Some have already been fired, held in detention or deported. Others are worried they will be abruptly expelled and forced to return to the dangerous homelands they had fled.

Which Countries Have T.P.S. Right Now?

This year, the Trump administration has taken steps to eliminate the program for more than one million people from eight nations: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela. But immigrant and civil rights groups have filed six lawsuits across the country in attempts to stave off most of those actions. Plaintiffs from Haiti have won relief in the courts and remain protected for now. The Supreme Court emergency decision immediately ended the protections for 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2023, leaving them at risk of deportation. The program will expire for an additional 250,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2021 on Nov. 7.

For nine other countries, including El Salvador and Ukraine, the Trump administration has left T.P.S. in place. But those protections are scheduled to begin expiring as early as next month.

In two other cases, federal appeals courts have allowed federal officials to terminate the program for some 80,000 people, mostly from Honduras.

Syrians became the latest group facing the loss of protections in September. That same month President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria appeared before the United Nations General Assembly to paint a new picture of his country after an offensive he led last year toppled the dictator Bashar al-Assad and ended a 13-year civil war. The T.P.S. program will expire for 4,000 people at the end of November, after which they can be deported.

Even favorable rulings for Haitians and Venezuelans would leave their status, along with that of hundreds of thousands of others, unsettled: The National TPS Alliance and the Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association, two advocacy organizations that have filed suits, are continuing their litigation to preserve the protections for both groups. The National TPS Alliance is also preparing to contest the termination of T.P.S. for people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal in November. And the U.S. government has indicated it plans to issue a new directive on Haitian protections by December.

Why does the Trump administration want to end the program?

Mr. Trump has long targeted T.P.S. The form of legal protection, passed with bipartisan support by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was created to aid people experiencing humanitarian emergencies.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration tried to end T.P.S. for more than 400,000 people, saying that conditions in some countries had improved and that the initiatives did not align with its efforts to tighten the nation’s borders. But the attempts to end the program were successfully challenged in court by the National TPS Alliance and other organizations.

President Biden later went on to expand T.P.S. protections and create new temporary humanitarian programs as his administration struggled to process record levels of migrants arriving at the southern border.

Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has tried to dismantle those Biden-era initiatives, claiming migrants who have entered through the programs are abusing the protections and have not been properly vetted. Now, as in Mr. Trump’s first term, immigrant and civil rights groups are challenging the administration’s actions, arguing that federal officials have violated administrative procedures and acted with racial bias in revoking the program.

In March, Judge Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court in San Francisco prevented the administration from ending T.P.S. for Venezuelans and Haitians while their legal challenge moved forward. Mr. Chen cited discriminatory statements made by Mr. Trump and his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, against Venezuelans as evidence that racial animus could have been a factor. He also said termination of the program for hundreds of thousands of people would inflict irreparable harm on families, cost U.S. businesses and industries billions in economic activity and hurt the health and safety of communities.

But in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to temporarily pause the program. Throughout the summer, the fate of Venezuelans and Haitians was in flux, until Judge Chen issued a final ruling in September to restore the protections. The Ninth Circuit upheld that decision, after which point the government asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.

What has been the impact?

The back-and-forth in the courts has created a fraught environment for T.P.S. holders. Many have been applying for asylum, work visas or other forms of legal relief. But the pathways to legal residency are slim, and petitions can take years to process.

After days of stress and deliberation, Rita, a labor delivery nurse in Texas whose T.P.S. expired in August, decided to return to her native Nepal. But she had to cancel her flight hours before her departure as violent political protests erupted in Kathmandu, the capital, shutting down international airports. Dozens were killed, and government offices and Parliament buildings were left scorched.

Rita, a plaintiff in the National TPS Alliance who asked that her last name be withheld for security reasons in Nepal, said she is now waiting to receive work authorization in Canada and trying not to feel “trapped.” “There has been no stable day,” she said.

Jhony Silva, another plaintiff in the case who was born in Honduras and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he had been protected under the T.P.S. program since he was 3 years old, when he and his mother fled the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. His parents have since been able to acquire legal residency through his sibling, but he has been stuck in legal limbo.

He has lost his position as a nursing assistant at Stanford University and is relying on community support to get by. But he said he cannot leave his 9-year-old child, nor the United States, the only country he has ever really known.

Madison police didn’t even know about the ICE raid until it was over, according to chief John Patterson.
So far, Wisconsin has not been targeted for the massive escalation in immigration raids taking place in neighboring states.
And some communities that have been tempted to accept federal dollars and cooperate with ICE have begun to think twice.
In Palmyra, where the local police department signed an agreement with ICE, community pushback has slowed down implementation of the agreement.","A family friend who lives in Mexico flew into Chicago last week to visit his college-aged son. We exchanged messages about getting together. Could the two of them come up to Madison, I asked. “The truth is with everything that’s been happening in Chicago, and the arbitrary arrests, we almost haven’t gone out at all these last three days,” my friend wrote back. “This stuff with ICE, it’s unbelievable,” he added. “But there it is. It’s happening.”

Sadly, he felt safer staying in his son’s apartment and then dashing to the airport Saturday to fly back to Mexico than driving across the border to visit us in Wisconsin.

The same day we exchanged messages, an ICE raid on the northeast side of Madison, not far from my home, swept up seven people. Madison police didn’t even know about the ICE raid until it was over, according to chief John Patterson.

So far, Wisconsin has not been targeted for the massive escalation in immigration raids taking place in neighboring states. But the Thursday morning arrests in Madison and a Sept. 25 sweep of dairy farm workers in Manitowoc mark a sudden shift.

Darryl Morin of the nonprofit Forward Latino addressed the Madison and Manitowoc raids at a Friday press conference in Milwaukee. “While other states such as California and Illinois have borne the brunt of these new immigration enforcement actions,” he said, “I fear we are turning the page and entering a new chapter, a new sad chapter, in immigration enforcement right here in our great state.”

“What we’re seeing in Chicago is now starting to hit closer to home,” agreed Jennifer Maldonado, an immigrants’ rights advocate in Manitowoc, who joined the press conference by video link. She described fielding calls from terrified family members after the crackdown in her area. “Many are people asking, ‘Should I send my children to school? Should I go to work?’” she said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims it disrupted an international sex and drug trafficking ring when it grabbed the 24 Manitowoc farm workers at a Walmart parking lot and in a door-to-door operation targeting workers’ homes.

But this is the same Department of Homeland Security that insisted a Mexican-born Milwaukee resident wrote a letter threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump — even after the person who actually wrote the letter, Demetric Scott, admitted that he was the real author and that he was trying to frame the other man to keep him from testifying against Scott at trial. Long after that confession a statement from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem celebrating the detention of “this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump” remained on the DHS website, uncorrected, connecting the wrong person to an image of the letter written by Scott.

Dubious hype about immigrant workers, portraying them as dangerous, violent criminals, is the now-familiar backdrop to a crackdown that does not, in fact, have anything to do with fighting crime. Fewer than half of the people ICE has arrested under Trump are convicted criminals. Of those, only 7% have been convicted of violent crimes and only 5% of drug-related crimes, Tim Henderson of Stateline reports.

In Manitowoc, “This [criminal network] narrative was pushed without any basis to try to paint a negative image of an entire community,” Christine Neumann-Ortiz of Voces de la Frontera said during the Friday press conference. Of the 24 people arrested, ICE identified one person who faced serious criminal charges. But, as Henry Redman reported, that person was not among those rounded up and was already sitting in custody during the Sept. 25 raid.

Neumann-Ortiz described seeing disturbing videos documenting ICE actions — agents barging into a home “as if this were some kind of cartel, when it’s a working class family” and of a father who was grabbed by ICE while taking out the garbage. “It’s disturbing. It’s very, very disturbing,” she said.

One bright spot, she said, has been the community response to “the tragedy that we’re witnessing around the U.S. and here in Wisconsin as well.” She praised Wisconsinites’ sense of “urgency to build community — to support each other.”

Voces and other groups have been training community members across the state, with Know Your Rights seminars and instruction on how to effectively document ICE activity without escalating a dangerous situation. They’ve been lobbying local communities to reject 287(g) ICE cooperation agreements along with the cash incentives the federal government is offering local law enforcement in exchange for rounding up immigrants — a system Neumann Ortiz described as allowing local police to “essentially function like bounty hunters.” And they’ve been trying to help immigrants prepare for the worst, connecting them with immigration attorneys and helping them make contingency plans by naming caretakers for their property and guardians for their children in case they are deported. Forward Latino is sharing helpful information in a “family separation toolkit.”

Advocates, Neumann-Ortiz said, are getting good at “combatting lies,” connecting immigrants with legal support, and moving fast.

Several Manitowoc workers have already been deported, she said, and another was moved to detention outside of Wisconsin, where it’s hard for his family members and his lawyers to be in touch with him.

Morin said he was on the phone with a Wisconsin resident who had been detained by ICE and he could hear an agent yelling in the background that the man had to sign a self-deportation order. Morin was also yelling, telling the man not to sign, and that they had to let him see a lawyer. “That’s happening on a daily basis,” Morin said. “The violation of constitutional rights is happening right now on a daily basis.”

Against a gale of misinformation, immigrants’ advocates are fighting to get out the truth.

“You can fight your deportation. But people need to know that and not be tricked or conned into signing deportation orders,” Neumann Ortiz said.

“It’s not a crime to be undocumented in the US. It’s a civil violation,” Morino added.

Farmers, alarmed at the prospect of losing the immigrant workers who perform 70% of the labor on Wisconsin dairy farms, have been communicating with each other and with immigrants rights groups, Neumann-Ortiz said, trying to help their employees protect themselves.

“We need to scale it up even more, so that people are not tricked into giving up their rights,” she said.

The federal immigration crackdown, and the way it has seeped into local communities, does nothing to improve public safety. We are all safer if immigrants are confident enough to call 911 to report crime and abuse “or if their neighbor’s house is on fire,” as Morin put it.

Despite the dire news, advocates see progress in community engagement and responsiveness.

“In the early days we were getting flooded with false reports,” Morin said. “People wanted to spread fear.” Now, through training and preparation, advocacy groups have created a reliable channel for information about ICE raids and are able to screen out unsubstantiated rumors.

And some communities that have been tempted to accept federal dollars and cooperate with ICE have begun to think twice.

In Palmyra, where the local police department signed an agreement with ICE, community pushback has slowed down implementation of the agreement. In Walworth County, Neumann-Ortiz said, public pressure helped persuade the sheriff to reject a 287(g) agreement and Ozaukee County rolled back an agreement to accept federal money in exchange for detaining immigrants arrested by ICE.

The massive increase in funding for ICE — and the incentives it offers local law enforcement agencies to pursue immigrants in their communities — is funded through the same “Big Beautiful Bill Act” that slashes health care, food assistance and education funding. “We’re taking away food from hungry kids, medical care, money from schools, to do what?” Neumann-Ortiz said, referring to the push to terrorize immigrants. “That does not promote public safety.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dsc05045_51265400144_o-2048x1365.png,N,,2025-10-04 16:59:16.107868

It’s unclear how many people, exactly, have been detained by ICE agents at the Fresno USCIS office, and whether federal officers are targeting green card applicants with prior arrests.

ICE agents also detained another man in July during a scheduled appointment at the Fresno USCIS office.","ICE agents have recently detained individuals applying for green cards at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office in downtown Fresno, according to local immigration attorneys.

Until recently, attorneys said it was rare for people to be detained during routine green card appointments at the USCIS office.

USCIS is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees lawful immigration to the United States and processes applications for citizenship, permanent residency, asylum, work permits and other immigration benefits.

Jeremy Clason, an immigration attorney in Fresno, said a client of his who is married to a U.S. citizen was detained during his green card interview in July at the USCIS office in Fresno.

“From 2005 up until when this particular client was detained, I had only had one other client ever detained at a USCIS office in 20 years of practice,” he said.

It’s unclear how many people, exactly, have been detained by ICE agents at the Fresno USCIS office, and whether federal officers are targeting green card applicants with prior arrests. But immigration attorneys said the recent detainments may deter some people from applying for a green card.

Clason said he suspects USCIS coordinated with ICE agents to detain his client, because his client’s wife was asked to remain in the lobby during the green card interview.

“This interview was very strange. I could tell from the beginning that the officer didn’t really want to ask the questions that she needed to ask him to determine whether he was eligible to become a green card holder,” Clason said.

Clason said that the ICE agents didn’t provide a reason for detaining his client, though he suspects his client’s past criminal history was a factor.

“He was never convicted for any criminal offenses. They detained him purely on arrests that didn’t result in convictions,” he said. “They didn’t even give him a chance to explain the details of those two arrests.”

Clason said his client was sent to a McFarland detention facility in late July, and immediately filed a request for a bond hearing. An immigration court judge ultimately granted his client’s release on a $10,000 bond in August.

Clason said his client was likely able to secure release on bond because he entered the country legally on a student visa, is married to a U.S. citizen and thus has a legal path to remain in the U.S., and has never been convicted of any crimes.

ICE agents also detained another man in July during a scheduled appointment at the Fresno USCIS office.

Fresno attorney George Rios said his client arrived at his green card interview with his wife, a U.S. citizen, but she was asked to step into the waiting area before ICE agents arrived and detained him.

“The position that ICE has officially taken regarding his detention is that they believe he entered the country unlawfully,” Rios said. “I believe the real reason they detained him is because of his criminal history. In my opinion, he is eligible for his green card because of the way he entered. He was a child, driven across the border at the age of four, and presented himself to immigration officials, which counts as a legal entry.”

Rios’s client is currently detained at a detention facility in McFarland.

Rios said he will need to prove several requirements at a hearing this month to give his client a chance to stay in the country. He said his client has been in the U.S. for at least 10 years, maintained good moral character during that time, and has no criminal convictions.

Rios said his client’s deportation would cause extreme hardship on his wife, a U.S. citizen, and children, the youngest of whom is less than a year old.

Clason, the Fresno attorney, said that, given the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, other people who have filed for their green cards may risk detainment at USCIS appointments.

Clason said a recent immigration decision, known as Matter of Yajure Hurtado, which holds that anyone who entered the U.S. unlawfully — regardless of how long ago — is subject to mandatory detention with no bond, will mean many people will face their cases while detained.

“Many more immigrants are going to be detained at the Fresno field office,” he said. “I think what’s discouraging from my perspective, the people being detained right now, filed applications last year, relying on USCIS’s policies last year.”

Whenever clients get interviews for their green cards now, Clason explains to them the risks and in some cases recommends that they wait to get their green cards until the Trump administration is out of office.

“Clients are becoming more apprehensive of attending interviews or filing in the first place because the chances of them getting detained are now much higher,” Clason said.

MPD posted this update on its website Friday:

“The Madison Police Department was not made aware of the presence of ICE officials in Madison yesterday until after their enforcement action was complete, and after they were already gone from our community. We were made aware of their possible presence by trusted community partners, and we were later able to confirm it by contacting federal partners. The Madison Police Department works closely with our community partners to ensure that we are doing everything that we can to aid in effective communication and ease concerns for the entire community.”

Centro Dane County, which advocates for immigrants, said seven people were arrested by those ICE agents on the northeast side of Madison Thursday. Spectrum News is trying to confirm more details.

Meanwhile, the FBI in Milwaukee shared this on social media on Sept. 25:

“Today, FBI Milwaukee and Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE) led a joint operation with the assistance of the U.S. Marshals, DEA, CBP, IRS-CI in arresting 21 subjects in Manitowoc County. All the subjects are in the country illegally. Nine of the subjects were targeted for their suspected involvement in the sexual assault and/or trafficking of minor American girls. FBI Milwaukee and our law enforcement partners are dedicated and focused on protecting and safeguarding our Wisconsin communities every day.”

However, the FBI has provided no evidence of their claim that nine of those people who were detained were believed to be involved in the sexual assault and/or trafficking of minor American girls. Immigration advocates in Manitowoc County dispute those claims and say many were dairy workers.

All of this comes as the Milwaukee Business Journal reported that ICE is looking to lease a large office space in downtown Milwaukee for immigration enforcement activities.

On Friday, some Milwaukee aldermen, faith leaders, advocates and organizations working to protect immigrant rights, gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to talk about ICE activity in Wisconsin.

Voces de la Frontera and Forward Latino are among the groups working to track ICE activity and help families.

“We are trying to document everything that’s happening for potential litigation and connect with families to try to meet their needs, like we are doing in Madison and Manitowoc right now to connect the people affected to legal services,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, the executive director of Voces de la Frontera. “It is traumatic for families and communities.”

They are also hosting seminars and trainings to make sure people know their basic rights, like you do not have to open the door to your house unless agents have an order signed by a judge. You have the right to remain silent and ask for an attorney, and you do not have to sign any documents you don’t understand.

“The overwhelming number of undocumented immigrants who have been detained or deported have no criminal record,” said Darryl Morin, the president of Forward Latino.

Trump allocated $250 million for voluntary deportations

Under US federal law, migrant children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian are classified as unaccompanied and placed in federal shelters until they can be released to a relative or foster care.

The process will start with 17-year-olds, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official, but will not include minors from Mexico.

""Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin,"" ICE said in a statement.

""Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option.""

Under President Donald Trump, $250 million was allocated to DHS in June by the State Department for voluntary deportations, with migrants being offered $1,000 to self-deport.

Critics decry 'cruel tactics'

Rights advocates have criticized the program.

Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, told Reuters news agency that it is ""a cruel tactic"" which undermines protections for children fleeing violence.

Melissa Adamson of the National Center for Youth Law told AP news agency that $2,500 ""might be the most money they've ever seen,"" making it hard for children to assess the long-term risks of voluntary deportation versus staying in the US.

Meanwhile, the administration's efforts to speed deportations have faced legal pushback. A federal judge recently barred the removal of Guatemalan minors with pending immigration cases.

As of Thursday, more than 2,100 unaccompanied children were in federal custody, according to HHS. Since 2019, more than 600,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed the US-Mexico border, government data shows.

Mario Guevara, 48, boarded a flight around 4 a.m. on Oct. 3. A federal appeals court earlier in the week denied his request to stop his removal, allowing his deportation to take place despite concerns raised by human rights, free speech and press freedom advocates.

In El Salvador, Guevara, an Emmy Award-winning journalist, emerged out of a Salvadoran Border Patrol truck along a roadway. Press flanked him as he returned to the country he left more than two decades ago.

“It’s not how I wanted to return to my country, but here I am,” he said, wiping away tears. His news outlet, MG News, was on scene streaming to tens of thousands of people on his Facebook page. A reporter immediately handed him a microphone.

“Am I live?” he asked, before taking questions from other reporters about his detention and deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to email requests for comment.

Guevara’s deportation has drawn scrutiny of threats to press freedoms in the United States during President Donald Trump's second term.

“Mario Guevara’s deportation is a troubling sign of the deteriorating freedom of the press under the Trump administration,” said Katherine Jacobsen, the North America program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, in a statement.

In a statement, Paul O'Brien, executive director of the human rights organization Amnesty International USA, called Guevara's deportation a “grave injustice and yet another attack by the Trump Administration on human rights, including press freedom, arbitrary detention, and the rule of law.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson previously told USA TODAY in a statement that Guevara's case had ""absolutely nothing to do with the First Amendment and any suggestion otherwise is laughable.""

""The Trump Administration will continue enforcing the law without apology,"" she said.

Arrested covering a protest

In June, Georgia police arrested Guevara while he covered a “No Kings” anti-Trump protest in metropolitan Atlanta, wearing a press vest and streaming on his phone.

Local law enforcement dropped all criminal charges against Guevara. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continued to hold him in custody as they began removal proceedings, saying he was in the country illegally and subject to removal.

The federal Board of Immigration Appeals allowed Guevara’s imminent removal based in part on Guevara not paying an immigration bond in 2012. Guevara’s lawyers, including the ACLU, disputed this, providing an ICE receipt showing he made a $500 bond payment as requested before ICE later cancelled the bond in 2015.

On Oct. 1, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, denied his motion to stay his removal, though it affirmed all people within the United States, regardless of immigration status, are guaranteed “the rights to free speech, free assembly, and free press,” even if they are noncitizen immigrants.

Guevara entered the country on a visitor visa in 2004. His wife and children live in the United States, and his lawyers said he originally fled El Salvador after receiving death threats for his work as a journalist at a conservative newspaper.

After the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2012 ended removal proceedings against him, he obtained work authorization. He recently applied for a green card through his adult son, an American citizen, his lawyers said. However, federal appeals judges determined he could be deported since he didn't properly file to adjust his status in the country.

Guevara said he was treated as a criminal in detention because of his work as a journalist covering the country's immigration crackdown.

As thunder roared in El Salvador, he said he planned to continue reporting, including on migrants he met in detention. When Salvadoran authorities received him earlier in the day, he said more than a hundred others were also deported with him, many of them crying.

“There are a lot of human stories, mine isn’t the only one,” he said.

Guevara hoped to one day return the United States. He called it his second ""patria,"" or homeland, where his children are.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/25/USAT/86348058007-img-5827-2.jpg?crop=4283,2410,x0,y1142&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-04 11:59:13.455922

Rather than come into compliance with Title IX, FCPS chose to sue the federal government and has been unsuccessful in its efforts, both in the Eastern District of Virginia and in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.","Today, America First Legal (AFL) re-filed its case in federal court against the Fairfax County School Board on behalf of Jane Doe, a recent Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) student, challenging policies that compel student speech on gender ideology and deny girls equal access to female-only facilities. In addition to asserting violations of the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Virginia Constitution, the new filing adds claims of Title IX discrimination.

AFL’s complaint details how Fairfax County forced Jane Doe to forgo her religious views and affirm beliefs she does not hold. Doe, and all her peers, are required to use other students’ “preferred pronouns” as mandated by FCPS’s “Student Rights & Responsibilities” (SR&R) guide. The guide also details punishments for students who do not comply, and requires parental signature and acknowledgement. Under the perceived protection of its SR&R guide, FCPS has continuously narrowed girls’ access to common facilities by allowing males to use restrooms and locker rooms based on their “gender identity” and subjective comfort, while forcing girls who object to find uncommon, private alternatives.

This case is about the rule of law and basic fairness. FCPS defends free speech and demands special accommodations for students who align with its radical ideology, but tramples the constitutional rights of those who dissent. Public schools cannot force children to echo contested ideology or sacrifice their privacy to satisfy leftist bureaucrats.

AFL’s new claims of discrimination under Title IX strike at the core inequality: FCPS gave male students safe, male-only restrooms but denied female students safe, female-only restrooms. In Jane Doe’s case, a male classmate was permitted to use the girls’ restroom because he said he felt unsafe in the boys’—but Jane, who felt unsafe and uncomfortable due to the male’s presence, was told to get over it or use a private facility. By allowing a male student to use girls’ restrooms while directing girls to uncommon alternatives, FCPS chose to treat a male more favorably than a female in the use of a female-only private facility—precisely what Title IX forbids.

Relatedly, in July of this year, the United States Department of Education determined that FCPS’s bathroom and locker room policies violate Title IX. Rather than come into compliance with Title IX, FCPS chose to sue the federal government and has been unsuccessful in its efforts, both in the Eastern District of Virginia and in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

“The law could not be more clear: schools cannot compel speech, cannot trample religious liberty, and cannot sacrifice girls’ equal protection rights in the name of a vague and arbitrary ideology that Fairfax County Public Schools can’t even define with any reasonable clarity,” said Ian Prior, Senior Counsel for AFL. “This case is about restoring sanity, fairness, and the constitutional rights every student deserves.”

“The School Board’s policies are untenable,” said Andrew Block, Senior Counsel for AFL. “We’re in federal court to vindicate our client’s rights and to make clear that the law—not gender ideology—governs in public schools.”

Ald. Jessie Fuentes said she was at Humboldt Park Health Friday, after there was a report of immigration agents at the facility.

She said when she asked the agents if they had a warrant to make an arrest at the medical center, they would not respond and shoved her.

Fuentes said she was later handcuffed and threatened with arrest.

""This is violence,"" Fuentes said.

Video shows the incident. Agents are seen claiming Fuentes was impeding their work.

The director of the hospital said, while United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can come into the emergency room, they cannot go into the operating room.

The hospital has no plans of releasing the person agents were originally trying to detain, who had broken his leg.

Fuentes said he broke his leg running from the agents. Attorneys were brought in to represent the person.

Fuentes also said federal immigration agents have brought a number of people to local hospitals, when they were injured during arrests.

That's false - NPR,Scott Neuman,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5560987/shutdown-undocumented-immigrants-medicaid-obamacare,"The White House and congressional Republicans say that Democratic lawmakers caused the federal government shutdown as part of an effort to extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants.
Republicans have accused the Democrats of holding the government hostage to a ""far-left wish list,"" including funding the health care of ""illegal aliens.""
They do not qualify for tax credits on the [ACA health care] exchanges,"" he says.
Gruber, who has worked on health and health care coverage policy for several decades, says the shutdown ""isn't about undocumented immigrants getting health care.
Gruber says health care is a complicated issue and ""the more complicated the issue, the easier it is to make a misleading claim.""","The White House and congressional Republicans say that Democratic lawmakers caused the federal government shutdown as part of an effort to extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants. However, as several independent experts interviewed by NPR note, that claim is false.

At the center of the standoff is the Trump administration's Working Families Tax Cut Act, also known as President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed into law in July.

Democrats say it amounts to tax breaks for billionaires and pays for them with deep Medicaid cuts. The White House insists the law protects taxpayers by preventing undocumented immigrants from getting government health benefits — but such individuals were already barred from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, exchanges.

""It's a complete distortion,"" says Leighton Ku, the director of George Washington University's Center for Health Policy Research. It is ""simply wrong in the details,"" he says.

In the weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, when funding for the federal government was due to expire, GOP lawmakers introduced a continuing resolution to extend the funding until Nov. 21. But Democrats demanded that it also include an extension of ACA subsidies — set to expire at the end of the year — and the reversal of Medicaid cuts.

Republicans have accused the Democrats of holding the government hostage to a ""far-left wish list,"" including funding the health care of ""illegal aliens."" The White House has said the Republicans' legislation ensures ""that taxpayer dollars are focused on American citizens and do not subsidize healthcare for illegal immigrants.""

Jonathan Gruber, the chairman of the Economics Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the Republican claim is false. People living in the U.S. who are undocumented ""do not qualify for Medicaid. They do not qualify for tax credits on the [ACA health care] exchanges,"" he says.

KFF, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that analyzes national health issues, notes that U.S. health coverage programs for immigrants are generally limited to those lawfully present. Medicaid and CHIP — which provides low-cost coverage to uninsured children and pregnant women — are restricted to immigrants with a ""qualified"" status, such as refugees and asylees, most of whom must wait five years before enrolling.

Subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage is available to these qualified immigrants as well as others, including those with Temporary Protected Status or certain work visas, while Medicaid eligibility is limited to lawfully present immigrants who meet age and work requirements, according to KFF. The Center for Children & Families at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University has also fact-checked the claim and come to a similar conclusion.

By contrast, some states provide fully-state-funded medical care for some undocumented individuals, but even those programs are being rolled back. Beginning next year in California, for example, undocumented adults will no longer be able to enroll in that state's Medi-Cal program, although children will still be covered regardless of their immigration status.

Gruber, who has worked on health and health care coverage policy for several decades, says the shutdown ""isn't about undocumented immigrants getting health care. It's about cutting health insurance"" for millions of low-income Americans.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — another priority for Democrats — will be reduced by more than $1 trillion over the next decade as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Ku, of George Washington University, says part of the confusion is over the definition of who is and who isn't undocumented. ""Sometimes when Republicans use the phrase 'illegal immigrant,' they include people who actually have legal status — like asylees, refugees, or those with Temporary Protected Status — just because they don't like them.""

Although Emergency Medicaid does technically cover undocumented people, it serves mainly as a backstop for hospitals, who are required by law to treat patients turning up in emergency rooms, regardless of their immigration status. ""Medicaid just helps hospitals cover those costs,"" Ku says.

""Emergency Medicaid is one or two billion dollars out of a trillion-dollar program. It's a tiny fraction,"" he adds. ""This is a tail-wagging-the-dog problem. These issues are a minuscule part of Medicaid and ACA spending, but they're being blown up into something they're not.""

Gruber says health care is a complicated issue and ""the more complicated the issue, the easier it is to make a misleading claim.""

An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll published earlier this week found that 38% of Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown, 27% blame Democrats, and 31% believe both parties are to blame.

He says that for Republicans, claiming the shutdown is about extending health care to undocumented individuals ""sounds good, it feels good, and it plays into the idea that people who 'don't look like they belong here' are getting benefits. But it's just not true.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5269x2964+0+40/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F83%2F7f6e70ef4e91bbad17b82a2de801%2Fgettyimages-2238610200.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 11:58:54.598462

“The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin.
Downloads of apps including IceBlock have surged as the Trump administration steps up immigration enforcement with surprise raids.
“We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,” Apple said in a statement.
Officials said last month that a gunman who opened fire on an Ice facility in Dallas had searched for apps that tracked the presence of Ice agents.","Apple has removed an app from its App Store that uses crowdsourcing to flag sightings of US immigration agents after facing pressure from Donald Trump’s administration.

IceBlock, a free iPhone-only app that lets users anonymously report and monitor activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, was no longer available on Friday. The app’s developer said last month that it had more than 1 million users.

“We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock has been removed from the App Store due to “objectionable content’,” the developer said in a social media post. “The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin. We have responded and we’ll fight this!”

Even though it has been removed from the app marketplace, those who have already downloaded the app should still be able to use it. Downloads of apps including IceBlock have surged as the Trump administration steps up immigration enforcement with surprise raids. The technology has come under fire from authorities after agents were targeted.

“We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,” Apple said in a statement. “Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.”

The app, first launched in April, was founded by indie musician turned entrepreneur Joshua Aaron. It’s a Waze-like app that allows users to alert others when they see Ice agents within a 5-mile radius of their current location. When Aaron first tried to put it on the Apple App Store, the release was pushed back for three weeks as he went back-and-forth with the company’s legal team and other “higher-ups” about the parameters of the app – including whether Aaron would be able to protect the privacy of IceBlock users.

“There were conversations almost on a daily basis with senior people there saying: ‘Is this even legal? Can we do this? Are we going to get in trouble for having this?’” Aaron previously told the Guardian.

The founder said Apple had a particularly difficult time understanding how Aaron, who did not intend to profit off the app and thus would not collect any data, would protect the privacy of the app’s users.

“Apple had a hard time wrapping their head around it, because they were like: ‘What do you mean you’re never going to make money? What do you mean you’re never going to track anything?’” Aaron said. “I was like: ‘Yeah, that’s the point. I don’t care.’ I don’t care about people’s data as far as being able to get analytics or track them or sell their data. I don’t care about any of that. I care about keeping people safe. That is literally the whole point. Eventually they allowed it on.”

In June – within two months of the app’s launch – Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said the app and its founder were “obstructing justice”. At the time, Noem suggested prosecuting CNN for reporting on the app. Months later, Aaron’s wife, Carolyn Feinstein, lost her job at the Department of Justice – a move the duo said they believe was “retaliation” for the creation and operation of IceBlock.

In a July interview on Fox News, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, said crowdsourced apps that allow people to communicate about the location of law enforcement officers is not allowed, specifically referring to IceBlock.

“We are looking at him and he better watch out because that’s not a protected speech,” Bondi said at the time, referring to Aaron.

Aaron responded to Bondi’s threat directly, telling the Guardian: “Please, come on. I better watch out? Why? I’m protected under the first amendment. This is perfectly legal, and I made sure of that.”

Yet there are many apps that track law enforcement and remain available to users, such as Waze or Google Maps. Those apps, in addition to providing navigation, alert drivers of potential locations of speed traps.

The Proclamation requires employers to pay a $100,000 fee with any new H-1B petition for foreign workers outside the United States, effective Sept. 21, 2025. The stated purpose is to address perceived misuse of the H-1B program and protect the domestic labor market.

On Oct. 3, 2025, a coalition of immigration advocacy organizations and affected employers filed a lawsuit in federal court in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the legality of the Proclamation. The plaintiffs include healthcare staffing companies, unions, academic associations, religious organizations, and individual workers.

The lawsuit contends that the $100,000 fee is unauthorized by statute, was implemented without required procedures, and will cause significant harm to U.S. employers, workers, and the public interest. The lawsuit alleges:

The Proclamation exceeds presidential authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs assert that INA §§ 212(f) and 215(a) do not authorize the President to impose such a fee.

The $100,000 fee was imposed without notice-and-comment rulemaking, violating the Administrative Procedures Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The $100,000 fee is arbitrary and capricious, untethered from the actual costs of adjudicating H-1B petitions.

The complaint also details how the fee has “sparked chaos,” caused confusion, forced workers to return to the U.S. abruptly, and led employers to halt or cancel recruitment and hiring of foreign talent. Plaintiffs argue that the fee will worsen shortages in healthcare, education, and religious services, and disrupt ongoing research and innovation.

Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the fee from taking effect, requesting that the court:

Declare sections of the Proclamation and related agency policies unlawful and set them aside.

Enjoin enforcement of the $100,000 fee requirement as to H-1B petition adjudications, visa issuance, and admission.

Order agencies to process H-1B petitions under existing law, without the new fee.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California, is led by a coalition of religious organizations, health care providers, unions, higher education professionals and others.

“Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators,” Democracy Forward said in the press release. “The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.”

Trump penned a proclamation on Sept. 19 raising the fee on H1-B visas to $100,000, arguing the program has been exploited to replace Americans with foreign-born workers who get paid less. Days later, the White House said the $100,000 is a one-time fee for future H-1B applicants and those with the visa will not have to pay the fee again to enter back into the U.S.

“By discouraging the best and brightest minds from around the world—individuals who have enriched American higher education for decades—he’s sending a message: ‘You’re not welcome here. Go elsewhere,'” Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, wrote Friday.

This short-sighted policy doesn’t just hurt universities — it hurts every American by slowing research breakthroughs, weakening our economy, and putting our global leadership at risk,” he added.

Critics of the H-1B visa program, which was created by Congress to attract highly skilled workers from overseas, argue that it is a way for U.S. companies to hire foreign-born workers who are open to working far below market value, particularly in the tech sector.

About a third of workers with this type of visa are nurses, teachers, physicians, scholars, priests and pastors, according to the lawsuit. Many H-1B visa holders work in the technology sector, but over a third of all H-1B workers are other fields, according to the lawsuit.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Reuters that the administration is engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.”

H-1B visas are valid for three years and can be extended up to six, according to according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

A lawsuit filed today in Northern California District Court seeks to stop the Trump administration from imposing a $100,000 fee on new H1-b visa applications.

The program is designed to bolster the labor pool of occupations facing a labor shortage such as technology, health care and education.

A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations joined together to file the lawsuit. The fee would be paid by employers.

The complaint alleges both President Trump and numerous government agencies including Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection and Department of State overstepped their statutory authority in imposing the fee.

It also accuses the plaintiffs of bypassing rulemaking procedures which require the public to be given an opportunity to comment before rules are finalized and implemented.

“South Asians make up the majority of H-1B workers and are part of the fabric of America, staffing rural hospitals, advancing lifesaving research, and driving innovation in businesses across the country. This unlawful fee threatens workers, their families, and the financial and social wellbeing of the communities in which they live,” said Kalpana V. Peddibhotla, Executive Director of the South Asian American Justice Collaborative.

The Justice Collaborative along with Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, and Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation joined together to file the case for the plaintiffs.

US Circuit Judge David Barron said Trump's order violated the US Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen. He said the length of the court's 100-page ruling should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question was difficult.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the court had misinterpreted the 14th Amendment.

""We look forward to being vindicated by the Supreme Court,"" she said in a statement.

Meanwhile the US Supreme Court has again cleared the way for the Trump administration to revoke a temporary legal protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants.

The justices granted the administration's request to put on hold a judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted under President Joe Biden while litigation proceeds. The Court's three liberal justices dissented.

""I view today's decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,"" liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote.

The court, Jackson wrote, is ""privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power"" over judgements made by lower courts that these 300,000 people should not be ""left vulnerable to job loss, family separation and deportation"" to Venezuela until the legality of the administration's actions is fully resolved.

Jackson noted that the US government in January concluded that Venezuela was experiencing a humanitarian crisis.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

""This is another win for the administration affirming what we have always maintained: Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary. It was never intended to be a pathway to permanent status or legal residency,"" Abigail Jackson said after the decision.

And in a separate anti-immigration strategy, the Trump administration said it would pay migrant children $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries.

The notice to shelters from the US Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Families and Children did not indicate any consequences for children who decline the offer.

Officials dismissed widespread reports among immigration lawyers and advocates that it was about to launch a much broader crackdown to deport migrant children who entered the country without their parents.

Advocates said $2,500 may prevent children from making informed decisions.

""For a child, $2,500 might be the most money they've ever seen in their life, and that may make it very, very difficult for them to accurately weigh the long-term risks of taking voluntary departure versus trying to stay in the United States and going through the immigration court process to get relief that they may be legally entitled to,"" said Melissa Adamson, senior attorney at the National Centre for Youth Law.

US authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021.

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.

A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. The court joined the four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The 14th Amendment

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily — and by extension, their children — cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration’s interpretation is countered by the amendment’s history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats — both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority — were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

Supreme Court rulings

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause’s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court’s conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Lower court decisions

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order’s February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

“The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,” Chief Judge David Barron wrote. “It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.”

White House response

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to “being vindicated by the Supreme Court.”

To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.

The main message, Cedillo and others told mourners: remember the names of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Norlan Guzman Fuentes.","Candles in the shape of a heart were placed outside Dallas City Hall Friday night as dozens of community members gathered to mourn the loss of two migrants killed in last month’s shooting outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office.

Norlan Guzman Fuentes from El Salvador died in the attack early Sept. 24; Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez from Mexico died almost a week later from his injuries.

""We have to fight for a future for a world where these things don't happen. A future where immigrants can live safely and can live in peace,"" said Judith, a community organizer with Venceremos DFW, who only identified herself by her first name.

A third victim, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, was recently released from Parkland Hospital and is in ICE custody at the Prairieland Detention Center. Large signs with Guzman Fuentes’ and Garcia Hernandez’ names served as a backdrop to the event.

During the vigil, people placed bouquets of flowers and hand-painted umbrellas that read “keep families together.”

Several community groups and activists partnered for the vigil, including Noemi Rios, a community organizer and founder of Vecinos Unidos DFW. The vigil was to acknowledge the victims, who she said weren’t treated humanely after their injuries.

“We are here to name that but as well as to acknowledge that this isn't isolated,” she said. “The brutality that ICE is bringing to Dallas is the same as the brutality we are seeing across the country.”

Activists read a statement from Guzman Fuentes’ sister, who lives in North Carolina. She wanted people to know that he had a family -- ”eight siblings and a mother who loved him dearly.”

In the statement, she said she hasn’t been able to see her brother’s body and properly grieve.

""She wants people to know she was told she didn't need to identify her brother because they took his fingerprints,” the statement read. “She's asking for justice for her brother and all those whose families have been victims of this violence.”

Federal authorities say the suspected shooter, Joshua Jahn of Fairview, was targeting law enforcement when he opened fire on the ICE office from the roof of a nearby building, striking the three detainees.

Garcia-Hernandez was taken into ICE custody since Aug. 8. He had lived in the U.S. since he was a teen, his wife, Stephany Gauffeny, told NPR.

Eric Cedillo, a immigration attorney and civil rights advocate who represents Gauffeny, told the audience that she wanted to be there, but had given birth earlier in the day to a son named Miles Alexander Garcia.

“ A little boy unfortunately who will never know his father, because Miguel's life was taken, f or absolutely no good reason,” Cedillo said.

Cedillo said there was a story about Miguel Angel that wasn’t being told. On the day of the shooting, Miguel Angel was sitting on the bus at the ICE field office, talking to an 18-year-old man about his wife and kids, when bullets crashed through the window.

“He turned to the boy and said, ‘I don't think I'm going to make it. Get underneath me. Let me shield you,’” Cedillo said. “That's the story that needs to get out. The heroism that was Miguel Garcia.”

Kate Lincoln-Golfinch, an immigration attorney and legal adviser for the League of United Latin American Citizens saidit’s important to counter the narrative about migrants without legal status and appreciate and respect them instead.

""It takes a whole lot for somebody to pick up their whole life and come to a brand new culture just because they want something better for themselves and their children,” she said. “That is something that I have a lot of admiration for and I know a lot us do. And that's the message that we need to be talking about more than what we're hearing on the other side.""

The main message, Cedillo and others told mourners: remember the names of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Norlan Guzman Fuentes.

“Everyone here, remember those names, remember those people, remember those families that we've lost,” Cedillo said, “because unfortunately, over the next few months, there's going to be so many others that we're never going to hear about.”

Lawyers for Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia say the Constitution demands his habeas corpus lawsuit, challenging his current detention and potential deportation, must go on during the U.S. government shutdown — and that he should be placed on home detention.

It comes after Justice Department lawyers filed a motion Wednesday requesting a stay in all aspects of the case because of the shutdown. They said government attorneys “are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ’emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.’”

But in a motion filed late Thursday, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argued the government failed to mention that the habeas corpus law “expressly instructs that in the event of a lapse of appropriations, this Court will continue to ‘hear and dispose of pending cases.’”

As of Friday morning, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis had not issued an order on whether an evidentiary hearing in Abrego Garcia’s case scheduled for Monday will proceed as scheduled.

With the status of the case uncertain, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers also note the government doesn’t have the right to detain him indefinitely.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers suggest Xinis impose the same conditions a Tennessee judge earlier ordered when releasing him before a trial there for human smuggling — third-party custody, electronic monitoring, home detention and regular reporting to Pretrial Services.

“If this Court orders Petitioner’s release from immigration custody, he would remain under these strict supervision requirements, ensuring both his appearance at future proceedings and addressing any alleged public safety concerns, however misplaced those may be,” Abrego Garcia’s lawyers wrote.

A U.S. immigration judge in Baltimore denied a bid for asylum on Wednesday, rejecting an application to reopen Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum case. He has 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Outside of court, officials with President Donald Trump’s administration have repeatedly referred to Abrego Garcia as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

In recent weeks the Broadview facility has become the site of escalations by federal agents against protesters and journalists. Videos of agents deploying tear gas, pepper balls and roughly throwing protesters to the ground have gone viral, amidst the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The Trump administration targeted Chicago with federal law enforcement starting in August, falsely claiming there had been a rise in crime in the city in recent years. Since then, there have been increasingly aggressive reports of Ice enforcement in communities, including helicopters hovering over apartment raids. There have also been arrests of local officials and candidates for office who were protesting, including Illinois’ ninth congressional district Kat Abughazaleh, who went viral with a video of an Ice agent slamming her to the ground, Daniel Biss, the Evanston mayor, and a city alderman who were aggressively arrested while trying to advocate in a hospital setting.

In Broadview, several people were arrested early Friday morning, after Ice along with Illinois state police, the Cook county sheriff’s office and other local law enforcement arrested and shoved protesters gathered for a weekly demonstration.

A local cabinet-making business, adjacent to the Broadview Ice processing facility, has had tear gas seep into their warehouse and workers hit by pepper balls, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

On Thursday, a group of Illinois law enforcement agencies, including the Broadview police department had announced they were forming a unified command to “enable the peaceful expression of the first amendment”, as well as ensure that local businesses and people in Broadview were kept safe, according to a press release. The statement also said: “The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law.”

Broadview, the mostly Black, working-class suburb of around 8,000 people, has become a flashpoint in what the Department of Homeland Security has deemed “Operation Midway Blitz.” There aren’t any figures publicly available for how many people are detained at the Broadview facility, which is not staffed or intended to be run as a detention center.

In the state of Illinois, almost 5,000 people have been detained this year, according to data from The Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Chicago Sun-Times.

For the people detained inside the facility, they describe not receiving adequate food or water, and having to use the bathroom in public. One person described to a Chicago Sun-Times reporter, not having soap or toothpaste and dealing with severely overcrowded conditions.

Katrina Thompson, the Broadway mayor who has been in office in since 2017, said in a letter to DHS that Ice agents were “making war in our community”, last Friday, and in response the agency warned there would be a “s—t show” in Broadview.

The treatment of protesters and journalists has drawn attention to Broadview.

One protester, named A’keisha who declined to share her last name, said that it seemed like Ice agents wanted to hurt protesters.

“What was unique on the first day is that it didn’t feel like Ice had planned to use their legal tools to remove us,” she said. “They have the right, right to say, ‘Y’all gotta leave, arrest them.’ But they didn’t. They chose instead to be violent and, like, push us and throw us to the ground and drag us.”

A’keisha has been involved in faith-based movements to end mass incarceration for years and has organized against militarization for almost a decade. She said she was moved to join protests because of her Haitian heritage and solidarity with immigrant communities.

Another protester, Reverand David Black of the First Presbyterian church of Chicago, said that he was pelted with about seven or eight “pepper exploding pellets” that hit his head, face, torso, arms and legs, while in a position of prayer.

“I’m not a political ideologue, but I am very deeply rooted in my faith, in the ways that it calls me to show up in this moment as someone who can proclaim the good news and call these Ice agents into their right mind,” he said.

Local journalists have been detained or attacked by federal agents as well. Over the weekend, Steve Held, Unraveled Press co-founder and reporter, was detained by agents while covering a protest outside of the facility. A Chicago-Sun Times reporter was also tear-gassed and pelted with “rubber projectiles”, according to the outlet.

On Sunday morning, CBS Chicago News reporter Asal Rezaei, was attacked by an Ice agent who shot a pepper ball into her car from about 50ft away and was exposed to chemicals on her face. She said in a social media post that after the incident, she was “puking for two hours”.

In addition to protesters and journalists, legal observers, often delineated in the Chicago-land area by their bright neon green hats that read “legal observer” were also attacked in recent weeks by Ice agents.

“There has been an extreme escalation in the use of force by federal agents at that facility against people who are exercising their first amendment rights, and targeted attacks against members of the press and legal observers with The National Lawyers Guild,” said Molly Armour, a volunteer attorney with the National Lawyers Guild Chicago for over 15 years.

A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the ICEBlock link to the Apple store delivers a message, “App not available.”

Watch on Deadline

Last month, FBI Director Kash Patel said that the assailant who opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas had search ICE tracking apps.

Joshua Aaron, the creator of the app, said in a statement, “I am incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions. Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move. Apple has claimed they received information from law enforcement that ICEBlock served to harm law enforcement officers. This is patently false.

“ICEBlock is no different from crowd sourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple’s own Maps app, implements as part of its core services. This is protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.”

He said that they were “determined to fight this with everything we have. Our mission has always been to protect our neighbors from the terror this administration continues to reign down on the people of this nation. We will not be deterred. We will not stop.”

The White House previously lashed out at CNN for even reporting on the app, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was working with the DOJ to see if they could prosecute the network.

At the time, a CNN spokesperson said, “This is an app that is publicly available to any iPhone user who wants to download it. There is nothing illegal about reporting the existence of this or any other app, nor does such reporting constitute promotion or other endorsement of the app by CNN.”

At the start of his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ensure that “no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.”

At the time, Trump and others on the right had alleged that the Biden administration had exerted undue pressure on social media platforms to remove Covid-related content they deemed as misinformation.

Trump’s executive order said, “Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve.”

“The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,” said Illinois State Police spokeswoman Melaney Arnold.
However, those laws don’t prevent police from helping ICE in other ways – in this instance, helping control crowds around the Broadview facility.
JB Pritzker has long said that state and local police cannot help federal immigration authorities under the TRUST Act.","Illinois State Police were among several state and local agencies in Broadview Friday morning during a protest in what’s becoming a series of near-daily demonstrations at the suburban ICE processing facility.

State troopers joined police from Broadview, the Cook County Sheriffs’ Dept. and the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS) as they assisted ICE to control the crowd of roughly 100 people.

The tensions flared in the morning following the installation of concrete barriers along Beach St. near the ICE facilities in an attempt to create a protest zone to keep people out of the roadways.

Why were state police there? Doesn’t state law prevent them from helping ICE?

Top Illinois Democrats have said for months that local police won’t participate in immigration investigations, but they also won’t stand in the way.

Illinois State Police officers were in Broadview Friday morning with other local agencies as part of a temporary unified command to handle public safety at the site. The village of Broadview requested the concrete barriers as part of the plan.

“The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,” said Illinois State Police spokeswoman Melaney Arnold.

But State Police officers were seen on video controlling the crowd – standing alongside federal officers in camouflage gear as multiple agencies, local and federal, attempted to control the protest.

What do Illinois’ sanctuary laws say about this?

Local police aren’t allowed to get involved in federal civil immigration enforcement under the Illinois TRUST Act. They can’t arrest people solely based on their real or perceived immigration status, and they can’t give information to the feds that isn’t already public.

However, those laws don’t prevent police from helping ICE in other ways – in this instance, helping control crowds around the Broadview facility.

What are Illinois’s elected leaders saying?

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has long said that state and local police cannot help federal immigration authorities under the TRUST Act.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul also released a statement Friday supporting ISP’s efforts in Broadview. He said their presence is crucial to protecting local homes and businesses.

“In accordance with the TRUST Act, the purpose of the activities conducted by the unified command is to maintain public safety and the ability to lawfully exercise First Amendment rights – not to engage in federal immigration enforcement,” Raoul said in the statement.

“State and local law enforcement do not violate the TRUST Act by establishing and maintaining designated protest areas and ensuring the unobstructed use of public roads - even if federal immigration enforcement activity is occurring nearby.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/62e1fd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7011x4002+0+337/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8b%2Fbf%2Fe05e957e444f83543ec83e923b34%2Fbroadviewprotest-100425-023.JPG,N,,2025-10-04 03:56:27.566925

The President directed the Department of War [sic] to conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.
Congress hasn’t authorized any military action against cartels.
The ambiguous language of the proposal would also potentially allow U.S. military action against anyone the military deems to be involved with cartels across 60 different countries.
Meanwhile, the White House has indicated that it hasn’t ruled out using military force within Venezuela, where many cartels operate.","President Donald Trump told Congress on October 2 that the United States is now formally engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which his administration has labeled “unlawful combatants” — an attempt to provide legal cover for unilateral action against civilians.

Trump’s announcement was made without a formal Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) from Congress and violates constitutional requirements saying that only the legislative branch can declare war.

The news comes after the U.S. military illegally bombed at least three boats in the Caribbean Sea over the past month, claiming, without evidence, that they were targeting drug traffickers. The attacks killed 17 people and have been condemned by human rights organizations as “unlawful extrajudicial killings.”

The memo to Congress states in part that:

Based upon the cumulative effects of these hostile acts against the citizens and interests of the United States…the President determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations. The President directed the Department of War [sic] to conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.

Congress hasn’t authorized any military action against cartels. Ordinarily, members of cartels are civilians, subject to the domestic criminal laws of the countries they operate in, and afforded due process. Under this logic, the administration’s strikes on the boats in the Caribbean would amount to extrajudicial killings, which is what some legal experts have already designated the attacks. This new determination from the Trump administration attempts to bypass that, equating drug cartels in general to “non-state armed groups” and individuals to “unlawful combatants,” and suggesting that “their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States.” This would mean the administration’s actions were subject to international humanitarian law, rather than domestic U.S. law. Even international humanitarian law requires the parties of armed conflicts to distinguish between combatants and civilians when targeting attacks.

The move essentially means the U.S. has been engaged in a “secret war” for the past several weeks, many critics contend, even as the administration has yet to provide evidence that the boats it bombed were actually operated by drug cartels. Indeed, a woman who identified herself as the wife of a man killed by the strikes said her husband was a fisherman with four children. He left for work one day and never came back, she said.

Geoffrey S. Corn, a retired judge advocate general lawyer, told The New York Times that the administration’s action goes beyond the pale.

“This is not stretching the envelope. This is shredding it. This is tearing it apart,” Corn said.

Meanwhile, a draft proposal to obtain an AUMF has been circulating in Congress. If passed, it would grant the Trump administration broad powers to target so-called “narco-terrorists” under domestic law. The ambiguous language of the proposal would also potentially allow U.S. military action against anyone the military deems to be involved with cartels across 60 different countries.

It’s unclear whether the White House has enough votes in Congress to pass such a measure, as it would likely be blocked by a Senate filibuster.

Meanwhile, the White House has indicated that it hasn’t ruled out using military force within Venezuela, where many cartels operate. Such an action would likely lead to a crisis — and potentially a war — between Venezuela and the U.S.

“If Venezuela is sending drug cartels to the United States by land or sea, he’ll consider action on it,” a senior official in the Trump White House told Semafor, notably leaving out that, legally, Congress would have to weigh in on the matter.

Critics condemned Trump’s announcement, warning that bypassing Congress to declare war could have dire consequences.

“Trump doesn’t get to ‘determine’ we’re at war — that’s Congress’s job,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said, adding that the matter “isn’t about public safety” but rather is “a power grab” by Trump.

“Trump’s actions are illegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) chimed in.

“These children have every right to pursue SIJS,” said Sophia Gregg, ACLU senior immigrants’ rights attorney.
According to the ACLU, their detention is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to classify immigrant youth with SIJS as “arriving noncitizens,” subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond hearings.
The ACLU is seeking the immediate release of the named plaintiffs, as well as a ruling that would guarantee bond hearings for similarly situated minors nationwide.
The complaints accuse the federal agencies of tampering with webpages and automatic out-of-office emails to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s administration’s policy of detaining immigrant children without bond hearings, stating the practice violates decades of federal law intended to protect vulnerable youth.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Eastern District of Virginia, names four plaintiffs who came to the U.S. after being abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents. All have obtained or applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a legal designation Congress created nearly 40 years ago to provide a pathway to citizenship for children who cannot safely return to their home countries.

“These children have every right to pursue SIJS,” said Sophia Gregg, ACLU senior immigrants’ rights attorney. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “recategorizing and reconsidering the entire federal regulations … and their justification really doesn’t hold any water.”

The four plaintiffs are currently being held at the Farmville and Caroline detention facilities in Virginia. According to the ACLU, their detention is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to classify immigrant youth with SIJS as “arriving noncitizens,” subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond hearings.

“We’re seeing this across the country for all individuals. Millions of people, potentially, are in immigration detention who would otherwise not have been a few months ago,” Gregg told WTOP. “Those unaccompanied minors are protected under the many federal laws and anti-trafficking laws that are specifically intended to protect children.”

Under the SIJS process, immigrant children must first be released to a sponsor, placed under custody orders from a state judge, and then they can apply for status. Visa availability can take years, but the protections Congress established were designed to prevent children from being detained while they wait.

Instead, the ACLU lawsuit argues, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is keeping children locked up and cutting them off from the ability to pursue their cases and effectively pressuring them to abandon their rights.

Gregg called the policy part of “a mass deportation agenda,” adding these are kids “Congress intended to protect … and identified as being the most vulnerable and in need of protection.”

“The immigration courts are now taking the position, as is the rest of the Trump administration, that nobody, including this specifically vulnerable group, is entitled to hearings for the release under bond pending their immigration cases,” Gregg said.

The case, Sarmiento v. Crawford, was filed with co-counsel Tanishka Cruz of Cruz Law, and Patrice Kopistansky. The ACLU is seeking the immediate release of the named plaintiffs, as well as a ruling that would guarantee bond hearings for similarly situated minors nationwide.

Violation of the Hatch Act

On Friday, the watchdog group Public Citizen filed 11 complaints against major agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration and the White House.

The complaints accuse the federal agencies of tampering with webpages and automatic out-of-office emails to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.

As of Friday afternoon, HUD’s website featured a banner and a pop-up message blaming the “Radical Left” for the current federal government shutdown.

Ethics experts argue the edits violate the Hatch Act, which bars political activity in federal workplaces and protects employees from partisan pressure. They warn the coordinated changes not only misrepresent federal workers but also use government resources to sway voters.

“This is unique. … These agencies are the biggest agencies in the federal government. You’ve got a coordinated effort coming from the White House to get the entire federal government and all the different agencies working together to try to influence the electoral mood of the American public to support Donald Trump and oppose Democrats. I’ve never seen this type of scope of violation of the Hatch Act before in my life,” government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman said.

Holman, who filed the complaints with Public Citizen, added, “This ought to be enough to actually make the Office of Special Counsel do something, or if they don’t do something, it gives me grounds for litigation.”

The migrants called the accusations “baseless and dangerous,” arguing that the administration was misrepresenting the lower courts’ work.
They warned the justices that allowing Trump to strip protected status would tear families apart and cause billions in economic losses, including Social Security and other tax revenue.
Lower court judges have reportedly become increasingly agitated by the Supreme Court’s scant explanations on the emergency docket.
“A temporary pause in implementing a policy change — even an important one — cannot by itself constitute irreparable harm,” the migrants wrote.","WASHINGTON (CN) — The Supreme Court sided with President Donald Trump Friday in a tug-of-war over protected status for nearly 300,000 Venezuelan migrants living in the U.S., spurning lower courts facing the White House’s wrath.

In an unsigned statement, the court said legal arguments had not changed since May, when the justices previously ruled in favor of Trump in a nearly identical appeal.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the court wrote, declining to explain its decision further.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, both Barack Obama appointees, said they would have denied the application.

Just like in May, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Joe Biden appointee, wrote a solo dissent arguing that the court was abusing its emergency docket.

“This court should have stayed its hand,” Jackson wrote. “Having opted instead to join the fray, the court plainly misjudges the irreparable harm"" and was instead “privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power over countless families’ pleas for the stability our government has promised them.”

With a choice between allowing 300,000 people to remain working legally in the United States or subjecting those individuals to job loss, family separation and deportation, Jackson said the lower courts had chosen the obvious, least disruptive and most humane option.

“We once again eschew restraint … and wordlessly override the considered judgments of our colleagues,” Jackson wrote. “We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

Trump filed an impassioned emergency appeal asking the justices to let his administration strip temporary protected status from the migrants, who face dangerous conditions in Venezuela. According to the administration, the lower courts blocked the White House’s policy in defiance of a prior Supreme Court order.

The migrants called the accusations “baseless and dangerous,” arguing that the administration was misrepresenting the lower courts’ work. They warned the justices that allowing Trump to strip protected status would tear families apart and cause billions in economic losses, including Social Security and other tax revenue.

Following the Supreme Court’s May ruling, the lower courts held subsequent hearings in the case, concluding that when the case proceeds, the migrants should prevail.

On Sept. 5, Senior U.S. District Judge Edward Chen issued a final judgment finding that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sidestepped review requirements. The Barack Obama appointee called Noem’s actions unprecedented and illegal.

The Ninth Circuit refused to pause Chen’s September ruling, stating that the high court’s one-page, unexplained stay order from May left judges to guess at the justices’ view of the merits of the case. The appeals court reasoned that the more developed record bolstered the migrants’ claims against the government.

Lower court judges have reportedly become increasingly agitated by the Supreme Court’s scant explanations on the emergency docket. The administration, however, viewed what some judges called confusion as insubordination.

“This court’s orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote. “Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them — as the lower courts did here — is unacceptable.”

Temporary Protected Status is a designation applied to nationals of certain countries where violence or economic duress make deportation difficult or unsafe. Venezuelans make up the largest number of such status holders in the nation.

Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden issued an 18-month extension of TPS for Venezuelans. In February, Noem revoked the extension, ending TPS status for almost 350,000 migrants.

During a Fox News interview, Noem called Venezuelan immigrants “dirtbags” and insinuated they were members of criminal gangs. Venezuela migrants and the National TPS Alliance, an immigrant advocacy group, sued the administration in February, claiming that Noem’s actions were unlawful and motivated by racial animus.

Chen ruled that Noem’s comments and actions against all beneficiaries showed that she made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS holders.

The Trump administration dismissed the claims, arguing that Noem’s actions were based on reasoned policy determinations. The Justice Department faulted Chen for stepping into the case, claiming that the ruling interfered with executive branch prerogatives and delayed sensitive policy decisions.

The migrants said interfering with Trump’s policy preferences did not meet the high standard for a stay, noting that the justices denied applications from the Biden administration on those same grounds.

“A temporary pause in implementing a policy change — even an important one — cannot by itself constitute irreparable harm,” the migrants wrote. “If it did, this court would have granted stays of the lower court orders that halted pro-immigrant federal policies promulgated during the Biden Administration. The same rules must apply now.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/07/donald-trump-and-kristi-noem-tour-alligator-alcatraz.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-03 23:57:38.816297

Reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity near Santa Barbara City College, UC Santa Barbara, and Franklin Elementary school on Thursday, October 2, raised the alarm among immigrant rights advocates who are concerned federal immigration operations are creeping closer to spaces that have traditionally been protected from ICE enforcement.

The 805 Immigration Coalition — which runs the 24/7 Rapid Response Hotline to monitor potential federal immigration enforcement on the Central Coast — reported several sightings of ICE vehicles early Thursday morning, including in the areas of Chino, Milpas, and Haley streets in Eastside Santa Barbara, with one sighting reported near Franklin Elementary School (though the school was closed for a holiday, and no students were on campus).

Rapid Response Hotline volunteers immediately follow up to verify reported incidents as they happen, sending legal observers to document any arrests and cross-reference the often-unmarked vehicles with a list of “known ICE vehicles” that have been confirmed to be used during previous operations, either for arrests or transporting individuals to ICE processing facilities in Santa Maria or Camarillo. These incidents are further corroborated by legal representatives who work directly with the families of individuals detained, arrested, or deported.

Just after 7 a.m. the same morning, Rapid Response Hotline legal observers were alerted to another incident near the Santa Barbara City College campus, in the adjacent residential neighborhood on Oceano Avenue. In this incident, 805 Immigrant Coalition confirmed at least four people were taken into custody by ICE officers in bulletproof vests and federal agents wearing navy blue “FBI” jackets. According to witnesses at the scene, the four people were taken away in unmarked vehicles after the federal agents smashed the driver’s side window of the detainees’ car.

After the early-morning incidents in Santa Barbara, 805 Immigrant Coalition dispatched multiple community response teams to patrol neighborhoods on the Eastside, Westside, and other areas of the city that have become hotspots for ICE activity in recent months. “Let’s protect each other and keep watch for our community,” the group wrote in a post on Instagram.

Another incident involving federal immigration enforcement — originally reported by UCSB’s student-run newspaper the Daily Nexus — occurred at a student dormitory on El Colegio Road around 10:30 that same morning. According to reports from firsthand witnesses, an individual who later identified himself as a federal immigration officer was able to gain access into the main lobby of the Santa Catalina Residence Hall (an area accessible only to residents with an electronic key), likely after a resident either entered or exited the front door.

The Daily Nexus spoke to a staff member who asked to remain anonymous, who reportedly said the officer — who was either with ICE or another federal agency — showed a front desk worker a file with the name of an individual whose address was listed at the student dorm. Santa Catalina Residence Hall staff could not confirm whether the individual in question currently lives in the building, and federal agencies could not confirm whether the officer had a warrant to enter the property.

Dormitory staff members and supervisors did not reveal any information about the individual, due to university policies which prevent the disclosure of any information about student residents without the student’s permission. After a few minutes, the federal agent reportedly left the dormitory without any further incident.

The Independent reached out to UCSB and the Department of Homeland Security for more information regarding the incident at the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. ICE did not respond to specific questions, and the agency does not comment publicly regarding day-to-day operations.

UCSB spokesperson Kiki Reyes addressed the incident in a statement sent to the Independent on Friday afternoon, in which she said the federal agent who entered the lobby of the student dormitory may not have been from ICE, but could have been from another agency inquiring about a student’s immigration status.

“The university is looking into a report concerning individuals identifying themselves as federal representatives who entered the lobby of one of our housing residences and asked to speak to an individual regarding an expired international student immigration status,” Reyes said. “By university policy, and in accordance with [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act], the university did not disclose any information and the individuals were denied access to the residence hall. At this time, the campus does not believe that the individuals were agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

According to University of California’s informational page regarding immigration policies (updated July 28, 2025), UCSB does not technically have the authority to prevent federal immigration enforcement officers from coming on campus to enforce federal law, though staff and UCPD are not required to assist in any capacity.

The policy makes a distinction, however, between public areas of the campus — which are accessible to any member of the public, including ICE officers — and “private” areas, such as dormitories and buildings with monitored entryways restricted to those with key cards. Specifically, the policy states, ICE requires a judicial warrant (signed by a judge) to enter non-public areas like college dorm rooms.

“UC employees are not required to affirmatively assist federal immigration authorities or grant permission to enter limited access space when officers do not have a judicial warrant to enter,” the policy states. “If an immigration officer seeks your consent to enter limited access space or requests information or documents from you about another individual, take steps to ensure that you have authority to provide the requested access, information or documents. Ask the officer for their documentation of their name, identification number, agency affiliation, and business card; ask for a copy of any warrant they may have.”

Since January, there have been more than 600 immigration-related arrests on the Central Coast, with more than 100 confirmed arrests in Santa Barbara County (though these arrests, recorded by 805 Immigrant Coalition, represent a low estimate, counting only those reported through the Rapid Response Hotline). The vast majority of ICE-related activity has occurred in neighborhoods with high concentrations of working-class Latino families, such as Santa Barbara’s Eastside and Westside and Old Town Goleta. While reports of ICE activity near school campuses has raised the level of fear among immigrant advocates and community watchdogs, there have been no confirmed instances of ICE entering a school property in Santa Barbara County this year.",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-11.00.15-AM-Large.jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 00:57:21.767679

This year protests against aggressive operations by Ice have been small in Portland, but Trump has used them as justification to deploy troops.","Protests in Portland, Oregon, continued on Thursday night, with locals clashing with officials and rightwing provocateurs, amid the latest federal deployment by the Trump administration.

A rightwing commentator was arrested and briefly detained by local officials after allegedly engaging in a fight outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility, local police said. Nick Sortor, a rightwing commentator who regularly visits protest sites to record videos, was released on Friday morning.

“You PROVED what we’ve all been saying for years: you’re CORRUPT and CONTROLLED by violent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets,” Sortor posted on X in a message to the local Portland police.

Another rightwing commentator said he spoke with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, who promised a “surge” of Ice resources in Portland following Sortor’s arrest.

For the past few weeks, protesters in Portland have been demonstrating outside of the Ice facility in opposition to the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. In response – despite fervent opposition by local leaders – the Trump administration had pledgedto deploy national guard troops on federal orders and federal officials to the city.

A coalition of 17 mayors in the state are opposing the deployment. Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, filed a lawsuit fighting the activation of 200 federalized members of the Oregon national guard. A federal judge will hear arguments on Friday on whether to temporarily block the troop deployment.

For years, Donald Trump has promoted an inaccurate narrative that Portland is a “war-ravaged” city with anarchists engaging in chronic chaos. In late September, the president designated “antifa” as a “major terrorist organization”. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is not a centralized organization in the US but closer to an ideology with a loose network of activists.

During his first administration in 2020, Trump deployed federal forces to the city amid the protests over the murder by police in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The protests spread nationwide and internationally but were especially politically polarized in Portland as it became the site of rightwing gatherings, counterprotests and clashes. This year protests against aggressive operations by Ice have been small in Portland, but Trump has used them as justification to deploy troops.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44f0d9dcbe63fcb6f73f781880ed09515d0bd9ee/458_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c447d0ba67ed5820fbf07a30035ab620",N,,2025-10-03 23:56:55.172962

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction won by Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates that stopped the Republican president's executive order from taking effect.

Trump's order, issued on his first day back in office on January 20, directs agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a ""green card"" holder.

The principle of birthright citizenship has been recognized in the U.S. for more than 150 years, deriving from the 14th Amendment that states that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen.

Another appeals court, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in July similarly upheld a nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order from taking effect on the grounds that it violated the citizenship clause of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.

The administration last week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal in that case and a related one. If the Supreme Court agrees, it would mark the second time the litigation is before the high court, after its 6-3 conservative majority in June limited the power of judges to block that and other actions by Trump on a nationwide basis.

The Supreme Court at that time did not weigh in on the validity of Trump's birthright citizenship order. But in three cases where judges had declared it unconstitutional, the court limited the ability of judges to issue so-called universal injunctions and directed lower courts that had blocked Trump's policy nationally to reconsider the scope of their orders.

The Supreme Court's ruling opened the door to Trump's order taking effect in parts of the country, fueling uncertainty for immigrants and states grappling with the implications of a potentially patchwork system of citizenship rules. Yet in the months since, lower-court judges have repeatedly blocked it from being implemented anywhere in the country.

The 1st Circuit was reviewing a ruling by U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, who ruled in favor of 18 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in February.

After the Supreme Court's June ruling, he reaffirmed his original decision to halt the policy nationwide.

He said a patchwork approach to citizenship would generate confusion, given the substantial movement of noncitizen parents and children between states and the impact Trump's order would have on administering social services to them.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108162838-17507131022025-06-17t160330z_1656582856_rc2e4fa07nci_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump-venezuela.jpeg?v=1750713142&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-04 01:57:18.188519

As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem met with employees inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Broadview, a crowd grew over several hours, some riled by newly installed barricades to separate them from law enforcement officers stationed outside. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the protests and any detentions at the scene.

Noem, whose visit to Chicago was confirmed by Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, also accompanied agents Friday on a raid near a local Walmart store, according to conservative media personality Benny Johnson. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Noem’s visit to the area.

Some protesters have aimed to block vehicles from going in or out of the area in recent weeks, part of growing pushback to a surge of immigration enforcement that began in early September. Federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response, and at least five protesters have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

Local law enforcement stepped up its own presence Friday at the facility about 12 miles west of Chicago. Several streets around the site were closed, patrolled by Illinois State Police officers wearing riot helmets and holding batons on patrol. The state police set up concrete barriers Thursday night to segregate protesters and designate spaces to demonstrate.

It was unclear how many people were detained Friday. One man was seen struggling on the ground with agents after he appeared to break through a line into the roadway and in front of a vehicle.

“Every week, ICE escalates its violence against us,” said Demi Palecek, a military veteran and candidate for Congress. “With this level of escalation, it’s only a matter of time before someone is killed.”

A spokesperson for Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker lashed out at President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday afternoon for the way federal agents, many of them masked to hide their faces, have been treating protesters over the past month, saying that they have “grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility.” The spokesperson said in a statement that the agents had engaged in “inhumane” tactics including slamming protesters to the ground, arresting a reporter and firing chemical agents into the crowds.

Pritzker’s spokesperson said a newly established “unified command” of the Illinois State Police, Cook County Sheriff’s Department and others on Broadview’s streets will control crowds while ensuring protesters their First Amendment right to free speech.

“They show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois,” the governor’s spokesperson said in the statement. “It is clear federal agents cannot be trusted to act to protect the safety and constitutional rights of the public.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations from the governor’s spokesperson.

On Thursday, Pritzker demanded Noem face the public by answering reporters’ questions and divulging details about the ongoing operation.

Noem, alongside Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, was surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew while standing beside a sniper’s post, according to footage shared online by Johnson. Johnson also posted video outside a Walmart store where he said agents, accompanied by Noem, had conducted a raid.

Noem said in a post on social media on Friday afternoon that she and her team were blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building in Illinois.

The village of Broadview said in a statement Friday afternoon that since Noem had appeared that morning “unannounced, at Broadview’s Village Hall asking for a meeting while Mayor Katrina Thompson was out of the building, the mayor returned her visit.”

“Mayor Thompson went to the ICE center, accompanied by the Broadview Police Chief Thomas, and officers, to ask for the illegal fence to be dismantled,” David Ormsby, the village’s spokesperson said in the statement. “The mayor was told by agents at the gate the secretary was unavailable to meet.”

Several demonstrators said they were frustrated by the designated protest zone, saying keeping them off public streets violated their First Amendment right to free speech. Others were angered by officers from local or state agencies standing shoulder to shoulder with federal officers, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE, the Bureau of Prisons and others.

Most ignored the zone to protest on the other side of the facility, where Illinois State Police officers held them back.

Jonny Bishop, a 28-year-old former teacher from Palatine, Illinois, who is from a Mexican immigrant family, said he has been hit by tear gas and pepper balls at previous protests. He said the main contrast between Friday’s protests and earlier efforts is local, county and state law enforcement agencies working alongside federal agents.

“ICE acts with impunity,” he said. “They know that they can shoot at us. They can tear gas us. And Broadview Police Department is not going to do anything.”

The Broadview Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, state police officers joined Border Patrol in advancing toward protesters, forming a larger perimeter around the building. Some protesters yelled in law enforcement officers’ faces while the officers grabbed them by the shoulders and pushed them back.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251003--broadview-protest-ew-246p-93e30f.jpg",N,,2025-10-03 22:56:31.878967

Critics of the tech giants capitulating to the Trump administration say it shows the sway President Trump has over Silicon Valley in his second term.

Apple said it yanked an app called ICEBlock from its app store after the ""safety risks"" of the app were made known to the company. The anonymous, crowd-sourced app describes itself as ""Waze but for ICE sightings,"" and claims to serve as an early warning system informing people when ICE agents are nearby.

The app was launched in April and garnered hundreds of thousands of downloads, but it was only after Attorney General Pam Bondi put Apple on notice, demanding the app be pulled from the App Store, that the company made it unavailable.

""We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so,"" said Bondi in a statement to Fox News.

The Justice Department did not respond to NPR's questions about its request.

Since the app never had an Android version, it was not on Google's Play Store. Still, a company spokesperson told NPR that it, too, ""removed similar apps for violations of our policies,"" falling in line with Apple's actions.

The developer of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, said he made the app in response to the Trump administration's stepped up immigration enforcement. After it was booted from Apple's app store, Aaron blamed political pressure and vowed to fight it.

He argued the app's service was engaged in a type of protected speech not unlike some of Apple's own apps, like the company's mapping app which allows users to crowdsource accidents, hazards and police speed traps along roadways.

""Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,"" Aaron said in a statement.

Apple's action has reignited the debate about what's known as jawboning, when government officials censor speech through intimidation and threats.

Conservatives for years accused the Biden administration of this tactic over communications it had with tech companies related to accounts that were spreading COVID and election misinformation.

Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension by ABC following comments from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was widely regarded by legal experts as illegal jawboning.

Kate Ruane, Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project, said Apple's move should also be viewed as the government's heavy hand muzzling free expression.

""When companies agree to the administration's demands in order to achieve some other goal, whether it be avoiding tariffs or getting merger approval, they send a message to others that it's ok to do the same,""Ruane said. ""What's worse, they erode the promise of the First Amendment for all of us at the same time.""

Apple CEO Tim Cook has made strides to ingratiate himself with Trump, as the administration enacts an aggressive tariff policy that could hurt Apple's bottom line, since much of its production happens in China, India and elsewhere overseas.

Cook in August walked into the White House and gave Trump a 24-karat gold plaque, a move that has come to symbolize Silicon Valley's deference to the president.

Trump has given Apple and other tech companies something of a gift, too, by exempting smartphones, including Apple's iPhones, from tariffs.

""I think many large organizations are trying to keep their metaphorical heads down and act cautiously, even when the government is acting improperly or even unconstitutionally,"" said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Cornell University, who believes Apple would have a jawboning case but does not expect the company to pursue it. ""Compliance will only incentivize further government demands.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7874x4429+0+697/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2Fd4%2F955ed608460aa801a278ec1b4478%2Fgettyimages-2233926823.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 23:56:58.577923

Lawyers representing children who entered the country apart from their immediate family have told LAist they are deeply concerned about the program because it appears children will be asked to waive their rights to see an immigration judge before being removed from the country.

This effort by DHS comes after the department attempted earlier this year to stop funding a program to provide legal support to children in the immigration system. All funding to the program was halted in March but ordered by District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín to resume in April in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and federal policies. Last month, 76 undocumented minors were nearly flown to Guatemala in the middle of the night, before the deportations were stopped by District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.

Representatives for DHS and HHS have not immediately responded to LAist’s requests for comment.

What we know so far

Unverified reports spread through social media and immigration rights advocate circles Thursday, citing supposedly leaked information about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement action called “Operation Freaky Friday” set to begin today.

The reports suggested ICE was planning to send “offer” letters to unaccompanied children in the immigration system 14 years and older, where they would be promised $2,500 in return for waiving their rights to see an immigration judge.

It was also claimed that if children refused the offer they would be detained upon turning 18 and their family members living in the U.S. would also be arrested. Plans to threaten detention or arrest have not been independently verified by LAist.

In a social media post today, a spokesperson for DHS denied the name of the operation, saying that it was made up by “anti-ICE activists,” but acknowledged that there is now a program in place that is similar in some regard to what was shared in the unverified reports.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” the DHS account wrote, also referencing an option for “access to financial support when returning home.”

Unaccompanied children are required to be transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee and Resettlement, known as ORR, shortly after they are detained by DHS according to a legal settlement made by the federal government in 1997.

In an email from HHS to legal service providers that was shared with LAist, HHS confirmed that DHS will provide $2,500 to undocumented children 14 years or older who take the offer, excluding minors from Mexico or those who have left their custody.

What lawyers are saying

Yasmin Yavar, deputy director for the American Bar Association’s Children’s Immigration Law Academy, told LAist that children who take this offer could end up waiving their rights.

“[The offer is] problematic because they are giving up their opportunity to be before a judge,” Yavar said, adding that children may not understand the consequences of that choice.

Yavar said that children who are detained and in the custody of ORR are supposed to get a “Know your Rights” presentation and be able to consult with an attorney to provide information about their rights and responsibilities.

Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, legal services director at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told LAist in an emailed statement that they represent hundreds of unaccompanied children and that the $2,500 incentive “has the potential to exploit their unique vulnerabilities as unaccompanied minors in government custody.”

The DHS social media post defended the move saying many unaccompanied children had no choice in coming to the U.S. and would be returning to family outside the country.

Multiple lawyers who spoke to LAist said that unaccompanied children commonly live with family in the U.S., and that federal regulations direct ORR to prioritize releasing children to parents or immediate family members in the country while they go through immigration court.

Some lawyers say that taking this offer could put children at greater risk.

“ It is really difficult to explain to kids what their rights are in not just clear language, but also child-friendly language,” said spokesperson Bilal Askaryar from the Acacia Center for Justice. He said the idea that an agent with no background in child welfare could get their informed consent to sign something that returns them to danger is “deeply troubling and it's cruel.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc97bc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1886x990+0+126/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F22%2Fbb76d65c4411af814d1495677ba7%2Fgettyimages-2235443593.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 23:57:08.014952

While protesters have flocked to the facility for weeks to protest the Trump administration's enhanced immigration enforcement, the scene outside Broadview looked markedly different Friday morning.

On Beach Street, long concrete barriers were erected overnight to create a designated area for protesting, keep demonstrators and federal agents apart and keep the street clear for emergency vehicles.

Protesters began gathering in that area early Friday morning, but just before 8 a.. that area started to empty out and the demonstrators moved to the 25th Street entrance around the corner and about a block and a half away.

That was around the time Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was spotted on the roof of the facility Friday morning, where she appeared to be filming something. Later she was seen outside, chatting with Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who is overseeing ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

The largest concentration of law enforcement — including officers from the Broadview Police Department, Illinois State Police troopers, Cook County sheriff's deputies and officers from neighboring suburbs like North Riverside, Hillside and Maywood — was and remains as of 11 a.m. around that front entrance to the building, as well as the usual federal agents behind the facility gates and on the roof. About 100 to 200 protesters gathered at that area throughout the morning.

At one point, police formed a line keeping protesters back from the ICE facility. A special team of officers dressed in black and wearing riot gear marched in and helped control the crowd.

The crowd of protesters has steadily thinned out since the morning. As of 11 a.m., there were more law enforcement officers than protesters remaining at the facility.

At least five people have been arrested by either Illinois State Police or Broadview Police; some for aggravated battery to a police officer, others for resisting and obstruction, according to the Cook County Sheriff's office:

Ezra Q. Imes, 27, was arrested by Broadview police and charged with aggravated battery to a police officer.

Rafael L. Menon, 20, was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with resisting and obstruction.

Audrey J. Gladson, 32, was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with resisting and obstruction.

Eman T. Abdelhadi, 36, was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with battery to a police officer, resisting and obstruction. She is a sociology professor at University of Chicago.

Tricia Black was arrested by Illinois State Police and charged with resisting and obstruction.

Court records show only Gladson had any prior criminal history. She pleaded guilty earlier this year to trespassing, tied to another protest in 2024.

At least a dozen people were detained and lined up behind the Broadview facility Friday morning. It was unclear if any of those seen being detained were among the five people arrested and charged. At least one person who was detained was also given medical attention in a nearby ambulance.

Shortly before 9:30 a.m., a large armored vehicle with an armed agent stationed out its top, made its way slowly through the crowd, though it was not apparent why.

There are also counter-protesters at the facility in support of ICE and federal agents.

There are digital signs around the facility warning people to stay off the streets and the majority of the state and local police involvement appears to be related to keeping people out of the roadway.

25th Avenue is closed until further notice between the entrance to the Eisenhower down to Roosevelt due to the protest.

The village of Broadview shut down its municipal building around noon, and the police chief did not respond to numerous calls from CBS News Chicago to ask if this was the kind of response or police support he had hoped for after asking for Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff's deputies to help handle the crowds of protesters.

Protests outside the ICE facility have repeatedly grown heated, with ICE agents firing projectiles and using tear gas at times. So far, none of that has happened on Friday.

Illinois and Broadview police said they are not assisting ICE with any detention operations in accordance with state law.

The Illinois State Police released a statement, writing, ""At the request of the Broadview Police Department, the Cook County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) and the Illinois State Police (ISP), with assistance from the Cook County Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA), have established a temporary Unified Command to coordinate public safety measures in Broadview around the facility being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Unified Command set up designated areas where people can safely exercise their rights, which will support the safety of the public, and ensure local vehicular traffic can safely access the roads in the area. As part of this, ISP has deployed a crowd control team. The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law.

Much of the activity was centered around a 9 a.m. news conference by aldermen, previously arrested demonstrators, and political candidates, who demanded transparency and safety protocols. They want to know why ICE has allegedly been holding people for days and weeks at a time. Speakers said they have heard that detainees are being deprived of basic needs like beds and blankets.

""That's apparently the United States government,"" said 40th Ward Ald. Andre Vasquez, gesturing at the facility behind him. ""We're barely united at this point. I can hardly call that government. What it's been has been the politics of division.""

Noem also accompanied agents Friday on a raid near a local Walmart store and later engaged in a tit-for-tat over unannounced visits — and even bathroom use — with the Broadview mayor.

Immigrants’ rights advocates and residents separately reported that federal agents had used tear gas near grocery or hardware stores they had targeted for enforcement elsewhere in Chicago on Friday and detained a city council member as she questioned the attempted arrest of a man. The federal government has restricted airspace over Broadview, officials said Friday, and Gov. JB Pritzker called for an investigation into an immigration raid on the city's South Side early Tuesday morning.

Objections to barricades, local police step up

At the ICE facility, some protesters have aimed to block vehicles from going in or out of the area in recent weeks, part of growing pushback to a surge of immigration enforcement that began in early September. Called “Midway Blitz,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Friday that it has resulted in more than 1,000 immigration arrests.

Federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response and at least five people have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

While Friday's demonstration was quieter at Broadview, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reported 13 protesters were arrested. Charges were not released but McLaughlin said they included alleged assaults on federal officers.

The Illinois State Police, whose officers patrolled the grounds wearing riot helmets and holding batons, set up concrete barriers Thursday night to segregate protesters and designate spaces to demonstrate, with several adjacent streets being closed. Many demonstrators ignored the zones to protest on the other side of the building, saying the corrals prevented free speech rights.

Others were angered by local and state officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder with federal agents, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE, the Bureau of Prisons and others. At one point, Illinois State Police joined Border Patrol in pushing back a crowd.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

Jonny Bishop, a 28-year-old former teacher from Palatine, Illinois, and from a Mexican immigrant family, said the cooperation concerned him.

“ICE acts with impunity,” said Bishop, who’s previously encountered tear gas and pepper balls. “They know that they can shoot at us. They can tear gas us. And Broadview Police Department is not going to do anything.”

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it has restricted Chicago airspace, with Border Patrol citing “a credible threat” against law enforcement amid ongoing clashes with protesters at the Broadview site. The restriction, which is in effect from Oct. 1-12 and targets drones, extends in a radius of 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) and includes Broadview. Critics question the length of time and the geographic breadth of the prohibition, worried about oversight of ICE operations.

Tear gas used on quiet street; city council member handcuffed at hospital

In a Chicago neighborhood, Andrew Denton, 39, stopped at a grocery store for lunch and heard honking from an SUV stopped behind a motorcycle parked in the middle of the street. He realized ICE agents were in the SUV and started shooting video just before the agents threw canisters of gas near passersby.

“There was no reason to use tear gas on the crowd,” he said. “No one was threatening them in any way.”

Denton said he immediately began tearing up. His nose began running, and he felt like he was choking. He said the 20 or so people in the area included seniors, families with children and children outside at recess at an adjacent elementary school.

In a near West Side neighborhood a few miles away, Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes shared video appearing to show her being handcuffed as she confronted federal agents at a hospital. She said a resident had fallen and broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

Fuentes arrived after an emergency room staff member called to say there were ICE agents in the room with him. In the video, none of them answers when she asks if they have a signed warrant. One agent then says, “You need to leave,” and handcuffs her from behind as she repeats her question about a warrant and then says, “You’re hurting me.” Fuentes said agents escorted her outside and released her.

Noem participates in raid, engages in restroom dispute

Noem, alongside Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, appeared on the Broadview building's roof, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew while standing beside a sniper's post, according to footage shared online by conservative media personality Benny Johnson.

Johnson also posted video outside a Walmart store where he said agents, accompanied by Noem, had conducted a raid. Another video showed detainees in a parking lot where Noem noted “consequences for breaking the law and jeopardizing our law enforcement.""

Noem attempted to visit Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson at the village hall, but she was not there, and Noem was turned away when she asked to use the facilities.

“The city police wouldn’t even let us use the restroom,” she said in a video.

Broadview village spokesperson David Ormsby said Thompson later “returned her visit” at the ICE facility, where she too was refused access.

""We are distressed to hear that the bathrooms are unavailable at the ICE facility,” Ormsby said in a statement.

Governor decries anonymous, ‘inhumane’ tactics

Pritzker, the governor, lashed out at the Trump administration for the way federal agents, many of them masked to hide their faces, have treated protesters over the past month. He castigated officers’ “inhumane” tactics including slamming protesters to the ground, arresting a reporter and firing chemical agents into the crowds.

“It is clear federal agents cannot be trusted to act to protect the safety and constitutional rights of the public,” the Democrat said.

Pritzker also ordered state agencies to coordinate possible action to “hold federal agents accountable” for a raid on an apartment building in the city's South Shore neighborhood early this week in which residents, regardless of status and including children, were detained for hours, some handcuffed. Children were separated from their parents, while officers smashed windows and tore through apartments, leaving piles of debris in the hallways.

Homeland Security officials said 37 undocumented immigrants were arrested, some with criminal histories and two allegedly members of a criminal Venezuelan gang.

As Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem met with employees inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in Broadview, a crowd grew over several hours, some riled by newly installed barricades to separate them from law enforcement officers stationed outside.

Noem also accompanied agents Friday on a raid near a local Walmart store and later engaged in a tit-for-tat over unannounced visits — and even bathroom use — with the Broadview mayor.

Immigrants’ rights advocates and residents separately reported that federal agents had used tear gas near grocery or hardware stores they had targeted for enforcement elsewhere in Chicago on Friday and detained a city council member as she questioned the attempted arrest of a man. The federal government has restricted airspace over Broadview, officials said Friday, and Gov. JB Pritzker called for an investigation into an immigration raid on the city’s South Side early Tuesday morning.

Objections to barricades, local police step up

At the ICE facility, some protesters have aimed to block vehicles from going in or out of the area in recent weeks, part of growing pushback to a surge of immigration enforcement that began in early September. Called “Midway Blitz,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Friday that it has resulted in more than 1,000 immigration arrests.

Federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response and at least five people have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

While Friday’s demonstration was quieter at Broadview, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reported 13 protesters were arrested. Charges were not released but McLaughlin said they included alleged assaults on federal officers.

The Illinois State Police, whose officers patrolled the grounds wearing riot helmets and holding batons, set up concrete barriers Thursday night to segregate protesters and designate spaces to demonstrate, with several adjacent streets being closed. Many demonstrators ignored the zones to protest on the other side of the building, saying the corrals prevented free speech rights.

Others were angered by local and state officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder with federal agents, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE, the Bureau of Prisons and others. At one point, Illinois State Police joined Border Patrol in pushing back a crowd.

Jonny Bishop, a 28-year-old former teacher from Palatine, Illinois, and from a Mexican immigrant family, said the cooperation concerned him.

“ICE acts with impunity,” said Bishop, who’s previously encountered tear gas and pepper balls. “They know that they can shoot at us. They can tear gas us. And Broadview Police Department is not going to do anything.”

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it has restricted Chicago airspace, with Border Patrol citing “a credible threat” against law enforcement amid ongoing clashes with protesters at the Broadview site. The restriction, which is in effect from Oct. 1-12 and targets drones, extends in a radius of 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) and includes Broadview. Critics question the length of time and the geographic breadth of the prohibition, worried about oversight of ICE operations.

Tear gas used on quiet street; city council member handcuffed at hospital

In a Chicago neighborhood, Andrew Denton, 39, stopped at a grocery store for lunch and heard honking from an SUV stopped behind a motorcycle parked in the middle of the street. He realized ICE agents were in the SUV and started shooting video just before the agents threw canisters of gas near passersby.

“There was no reason to use tear gas on the crowd,” he said. “No one was threatening them in any way.”

Denton said he immediately began tearing up. His nose began running, and he felt like he was choking. He said the 20 or so people in the area included seniors, families with children and children outside at recess at an adjacent elementary school.

In a near West Side neighborhood a few miles away, Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes shared video appearing to show her being handcuffed as she confronted federal agents at a hospital. She said a resident had fallen and broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

Fuentes arrived after an emergency room staff member called to say there were ICE agents in the room with him. In the video, none of them answers when she asks if they have a signed warrant. One agent then says, “You need to leave,” and handcuffs her from behind as she repeats her question about a warrant and then says, “You’re hurting me.” Fuentes said agents escorted her outside and released her.

Noem participates in raid, engages in restroom dispute

Noem, alongside Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, appeared on the Broadview building’s roof, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew while standing beside a sniper’s post, according to footage shared online by conservative media personality Benny Johnson.

Johnson also posted video outside a Walmart store where he said agents, accompanied by Noem, had conducted a raid. Another video showed detainees in a parking lot where Noem noted “consequences for breaking the law and jeopardizing our law enforcement.”

Noem attempted to visit Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson at the village hall, but she was not there, and Noem was turned away when she asked to use the facilities.

“The city police wouldn’t even let us use the restroom,” she said in a video.

Broadview village spokesperson David Ormsby said Thompson later “returned her visit” at the ICE facility, where she too was refused access.

“We are distressed to hear that the bathrooms are unavailable at the ICE facility,” Ormsby said in a statement.

Governor decries anonymous, ‘inhumane’ tactics

Pritzker, the governor, lashed out at the Trump administration for the way federal agents, many of them masked to hide their faces, have treated protesters over the past month. He castigated officers’ “inhumane” tactics including slamming protesters to the ground, arresting a reporter and firing chemical agents into the crowds.

“It is clear federal agents cannot be trusted to act to protect the safety and constitutional rights of the public,” the Democrat said.

Pritzker also ordered state agencies to coordinate possible action to “hold federal agents accountable” for a raid on an apartment building in the city’s South Shore neighborhood early this week in which residents, regardless of status and including children, were detained for hours, some handcuffed. Children were separated from their parents, while officers smashed windows and tore through apartments, leaving piles of debris in the hallways.

Homeland Security officials said 37 undocumented immigrants were arrested, some with criminal histories and two allegedly members of a criminal Venezuelan gang.

ACE President Ted Mitchell and others in the higher education community responded by noting that this is yet another instance of the administration weaponizing federal funding to achieve its ideological and political aims. They made clear that the goal of this effort is to pressure higher education leaders in ways that are wholly inappropriate and threatening to core concepts of academic freedom.

The compact acknowledges that “American higher education is the envy of the world and represents a key strategic benefit for our Nation.” It goes on to say that, “To advance the national interest arising out of this unique relationship, this Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education represents the priorities of the U.S. government in its engagements with universities that benefit from the relationship. Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits.”

It is not entirely clear just what federal funds and benefits might be withheld from institutions that elect not to sign the compact. May Mailman, senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told The Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration doesn’t plan to limit federal funding solely to schools that sign the compact but that they would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials.

The compact’s conditions include a range of major demands including that institutions: ban the use of race or sex in hiring and admissions; freeze tuition for five years; cap international undergrad enrollment at 15 percent; require that applicants take the SAT or a similar test; and quell grade inflation. It also focuses on issues around free speech, asking institutions to ensure a “vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and change governance structures or close departments that “punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”

ACE’s Mitchell told The New York Times that the document seemed to him like a naked exercise of power, lacking internal coherence. He said that if institutions agreed to the compact, it would set “a horrible precedent to cede power to the federal government.”

Mitchell added in an interview with The Washington Post that the administration’s new initiative violates campus independence and undermines free speech. “It’s not worth the compromises that they would have to make,” he said. “This is a Faustian bargain.” And in other comments in USA Today, he added that, “Any effort to reward or punish institutions based on their adherence to the views of government officials should trouble all Americans.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times that the compact and its conditions are “extortion, plain and simple,” noting that a White House official indicated the administration wants to extend the compact to all institutions of higher education.

Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and Harvard University president, told The Washington Post that while “elite universities” need to undertake some reforms the compact is like trying to “fix a watch with a hammer—ill-conceived and counterproductive,” adding that, “The backlash against its crudity will likely set back necessary reform efforts.”

ACE Senior Vice President for Government Relations and National Engagement Jon Fansmith told The Chronicle of Higher Education that the compact might not hold up in court because it involves placing criteria into a grant program that gives an advantage for aligning with the administration’s priorities. In addition, some grant programs, as well as direct student loans and Pell Grants, have eligibility standards that are set in law, and it is not clear if the compact can circumvent that.",https://www.acenet.edu/PublishingImages/Photo-Library/White-House-Snow.jpg?RenditionID=14,N,,2025-10-03 23:56:50.077860

At times, protesters are interacting with city police, county deputies or federal agents, and each agency handles arrests differently, which makes it harder for the public and journalists to track what is exactly happening.

Arrests versus prosecutions

Most of the time, law enforcement around the ICE facility involves federal officers, who are responsible for securing the federal facility and enforcing federal law around the building, ranging from relatively minor charges, like trespassing, to more serious offenses, like assaulting a federal officer.

KGW has found that in many cases, those taken into federal custody aren't formally charged. Thus, people on the scene might hear of an arrest in the moment but never see it go to a courtroom.

For instance, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon announced Thursday morning that a woman was in federal court on a felony offense of assaulting a federal officer Tuesday night at the ICE facility.

According to court documents, the woman had ""applied red paint to the driveway of the ICE facility,"" and while being processed by federal officers, allegedly ""struck one."" That woman has been released pending further court proceedings.

In contrast, KGW also received a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, saying that six people were arrested for various offenses Tuesday night — but with no names or details.

Without names, KGW cannot track these arrests in the federal judicial system, and if they have not been booked and held at the Multnomah County Jail, KGW does not know if they are detained.

As with the case of the woman accused of putting red paint in front of the ICE building Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office will sometimes later put out statements regarding cases they intend to prosecute. But those cases appear few compared to the number of people arrested or detained by federal officers.

According to an infographic shared by the FBI on Thursday, federal officers made one arrest at the ICE facility in the prior 24 hours, allegedly for destruction of federal property. The agency said it has 27 active and pending investigations, though they claim 128 arrests since June 9.

“That’s a force to be reckoned with.” Portland remains a flashpoint for unrest, with the ICE facility at the center of nightly confrontations.
The warnings follow an attack on an ICE facility in Dallas on Sept. 24.","Federal immigration officials say their Portland, Oregon, facility has come under nightly attack, with little help from local police because of political directives from city leaders.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Cammila Wamsley, director of Portland’s ICE office, said the facility has faced violence for more than 100 consecutive nights, with Portland police largely absent under guidance from the mayor and city council.

“I just, I can’t figure out what’s happening at the FDA. I’m totally baffled by it,” Wamsley said, describing her frustration at seeing federal staff attacked outside the building while officers inside lack jurisdiction to intervene. “It’s frustrating for us to watch people be attacked on the street and know that we don’t have the authority to be able to really step in unless there’s some nexus to federal law.”

She said nightly protests have escalated beyond chants and signs, with bottle rockets striking the ICE building, rocks shattering windows, lasers targeting officers’ eyes, and barricades blocking vehicles.

Wamsley said protesters have followed ICE staff members home and doxxed at least six employees.

“Later, towards the evening and around dark, there are a lot of folks that come up dressed in all black,” she explained. “They are here to wreak havoc. They’ll block our cars, throw paint, damage property, and even try to follow our folks home.”

She warned that when crowds swell quickly, the violence becomes more dangerous.

“We’ve seen it before. The folks here can go from a crowd of 50 to a crowd of 1,000 in 30 minutes,” she explained. “Sometimes we only have 20 officers here. We would not be able to defend the building with that show of force.”

Wamsley said the Portland Police Department has been slow to respond — and sometimes doesn’t respond at all — because of city policy. She explained that assaults have occurred outside and across the street from the building, but police have either taken too long to arrive or not shown up at all.

“That is not the stance they would take six blocks from here, but it is the stance they take with us because of guidance from the mayor and city council,” Wamsley said.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Portland mayor’s office and police department for comment.

Still, Wamsley said ICE staff remain committed to their mission despite the unrest.

“The people that work here are here to serve the American public,” she said. “They are here to enforce the same immigration laws we’ve had in place since the 1950s. Nothing has changed in that regard. We come to work every day. We do our job the way we have been doing it, and we’ll continue to do that.”

Todd Rignel, assistant special agent for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Oregon, said federal agencies are targeting Antifa-linked groups they blame for organizing much of the unrest.

“They’re not just facing HSI. They’re facing the FBI, ATF, DEA, IRS — all of these agencies,” he said. “That’s a force to be reckoned with.”

Portland remains a flashpoint for unrest, with the ICE facility at the center of nightly confrontations.

President Donald Trump announced plans to send 200 National Guard troops to Portland to support immigration authorities. Officials said the troops would be stationed near protest areas.

The warnings follow an attack on an ICE facility in Dallas on Sept. 24. Authorities said two detainees were killed and another was hospitalized after a gunman opened fire before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot.

The court’s ruling came at a time of simmering tensions between the United States and Venezuela.
The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in almost every case it has been called upon to review since Mr Trump returned to the presidency in January.
“This is another win for the administration affirming what we have always maintained: Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary.
“This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the Supreme Court has abandoned law for politics,” Prof Arulanantham said.","WASHINGTON - The US Supreme Court again cleared the way on Oct 3 for Donald Trump’s administration to revoke a temporary legal protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, backing a key priority of the Republican president as he pursues a policy of mass deportations.

The justices granted the administration’s request to put on hold a judge’s ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices dissented.

The court’s ruling came at a time of simmering tensions between the United States and Venezuela.

The TPS programme is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based US District Judge Edward Chen had issued at an earlier stage of the case that halted the TPS termination while a legal challenge by TPS holders and an advocacy group played out.

Judge Chen issued a final ruling on Sept 5, finding that Ms Noem’s actions to terminate the programme violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge’s ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Ms Noem had determined that to be “contrary to the national interest,” according to the administration.

The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order on Oct 3 that although the litigation had advanced to a later stage, “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not. The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.”

“I view today’s decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a sole dissenting opinion.

The court, Ms Jackson wrote, is “privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power” over judgments made by lower courts that these 300,000 people should not be “left vulnerable to job loss, family separation and deportation” to Venezuela until the legality of the administration’s actions is fully resolved.

Ms Jackson noted that the US government in January concluded that Venezuela was experiencing a humanitarian crisis.

“We once again use our equitable power (but not our opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible,” Ms Jackson added.

Mr Trump’s administration has repeatedly turned to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket to ask the justices in 2025 to allow implementation of his policies that have been impeded by lower courts.

In contrast to the court’s regular work, these decisions are made quickly, without the benefit of oral arguments and extensive written briefing.

The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in almost every case it has been called upon to review since Mr Trump returned to the presidency in January.

“This is another win for the administration affirming what we have always maintained: Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary. It was never intended to be a pathway to permanent status or legal residency,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said after the decision.

Judge Chen also faulted Ms Noem’s “discriminatory statements” concerning the Venezuelans, noting that her generalisation of the alleged crimes of a few migrants “to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders, who have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population, is a classic form of racism.”

Lawyers for the plaintiffs decried the Supreme Court’s decision.

“The court is throwing aside its standards to green light the Trump administration’s lawless actions. The damage to the rule of law as well as directly affected American families is profound,” said Ms Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped represent the plaintiffs.

The decision also extends the Supreme Court’s emergency power “to the final judgments of lower courts, beyond mere interim rulings,” added Professor Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of a UCLA immigration law centre and another lawyer for the plaintiffs.

“This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the Supreme Court has abandoned law for politics,” Prof Arulanantham said.

Mr Trump has made cracking down on immigration - legal and illegal - a central plank of his second term as president, and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The US government under Mr Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023.

Just days before Mr Trump returned to office in January, Mr Biden’s administration announced an extension of the programme to October 2026.

Ms Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Judge Chen’s final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration, which said it amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court given the prior action by the justices in the case.

“In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility,"" the spokesperson said.
Broadview police launched three criminal investigations at the ICE facility, including two alleged hit-and-run cases and a criminal damage to property incident.
''As a local law enforcement official, I have to have faith that federal law enforcement partners will cooperate with us in this investigation,'' said Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills.","Illinois police officers in riot gear, new concrete barriers and a designated protest zone were seen at the Broadview ICE facility Friday as demonstrations continued following weeks of heightened tensions outside the building.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Border Control Commander Greg Bovino could be seen visiting the building as protesters and agents once again clashed, resulting in numerous arrests.

""We're fighting fascism, literally. They call Chicago a war zone and yet they're the ones bringing guns,"" one protester, a Marine veteran who served overseas, told NBC Chicago at the scene.

Illinois State Police officers wore riot gear, federal agents lined the roof of the facility, and officers from the Cook County Sheriff's office and Broadview Police Department were present, marking one of the largest law enforcement responses to the area since protesting began. State and local officers were assisting with maintaining a perimeter and monitoring street closures.

As of 4 p.m., five arrests had been made, according a unified command coordinating public safety at the site. Of the arrests, three people were apprehended for resisting and obstruction, while two people were accused of aggravated battery of a police officer.

Demonstrations began early Friday morning on both sides of the building, including in a new designated protest area, which was requested by state and local law enforcement due to safety concerns and is situated more than a block away from the building.

The Broadview facility, being used by the Trump administration for the immigration campaign known as ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" has frequently been the site of escalating clashes between protesters and armed guards, with reports of agents using tear gas, pepper spray and other chemical agents.

In the past few weeks, NBC 5 reporters have witnessed tensions escalate between agents and protesters at the facility. Some protesters have been thrown to the ground and arrested; others were hit with pepper balls and tear gas. DHS told NBC Chicago protesters have lit fireworks and trespassed, adding they have been violent toward ICE agents.

On Saturday afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi warned of plans to send additional federal agents to ICE facilities around the country. Days later, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said 100 military personnel would be sent to Illinois at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security.

A spokesperson for Pritzker, in a statement released Friday, accused federal agents of ""acting with impunity"" at the scene.

“In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility,"" the spokesperson said. ""This includes firing chemical agents at protesters and media, arresting a reporter, slamming people to the ground, and wreaking havoc on Broadview residents and nearby businesses.""

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson, at a news conference on Tuesday, denounced what she said were displays of force at the facility in the western Chicago suburb and called for the removal of added fencing near the building.

""This extreme response is not only violating the rights of protesters but is actively endangering nearby Broadview residents and hampering the essential work of the village's first responders,"" she said.

Broadview police launched three criminal investigations at the ICE facility, including two alleged hit-and-run cases and a criminal damage to property incident.

''As a local law enforcement official, I have to have faith that federal law enforcement partners will cooperate with us in this investigation,'' said Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills. ''We will do our best, we will leave no stone unturned. We will continue to visit that facility, requesting to speak to people.”

NBC 5 reached out to DHS and received a statement from an ICE spokesperson, saying in part the ''Broadview Processing Center continues to face violence and unlawful activity by rioters. The relentless actions of these individuals — and their attempts to obstruct the enforcement of federal law — are unacceptable.”

The statement goes on to say, “We have repeatedly requested assistance from state and local law enforcement, including your own police department, to disperse these unlawful assemblies. Instead, local inaction has enabled agitators to escalate violence and placed federal officers, first responders, and Broadview residents in harm’s way.”

Broadview police said they have responded to the facility and alleged that officers have been verbally insulted by federal agents and exposed to chemicals.

Meanwhile, some local politicians joining protesters at the scene Friday expressed concern about conditions inside the facility.

“We are gathered here in solidarity and perseverance, to demand transparency, to know what is happening behind those boarded up windows, and to allow elected officials Delia Ramirez and Chuy Garcia to inspect the facility like they are allowed to by law,"" Illinois congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh said.

At a press conference on Monday, Eréndira Rendón, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project, delivered an emotional statement calling out what she said were ""inhumane conditions"" inside the Broadview facility.⁠

Secretary Mayorkas’s extension applied to two prior designations of TPS for Venezuela – one issued in 2021 and a second issued in 2023.

On January 28, new DHS Secretary Noem announced that she was vacating Secretary Mayorkas’s extension. The vacatur meant that TPS for Venezuela would revert to its prior expiration dates of April 2, 2025 (for the 2023 designation) and September 10, 2025 (for the 2021 designation), while Secretary Noem decided whether to extend protections in her own right. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary made the decision not to further extend the 2023 designation and specified April 7, 2025 as the date that 2023 Venezuela TPS benefits would expire.

The Supreme Court issued a May 2025 emergency ruling that meant the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation was deemed terminated as of early April, while litigation continued. However, on September 5, in National TPS Alliance et al. v. Noem et al. (N.D. Cal., No. 3:25-cv-01766), the federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of TPS plaintiffs, finding that DHS’s vacatur and termination of the 2023 TPS designation were unlawful, and setting those actions aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). DHS filed an appeal of that September 5 district court order with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and with the U.S. Supreme Court. The Ninth Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the lower court decision while it continued to hear the appeal on the merits. Today, however, the Supreme Court granted the government’s stay request, permitting DHS to enforce the early April termination date for the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation.

While appeals of the September 5 district court reinstatement decision continue, DHS will be permitted to take enforcement action against former beneficiaries of the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation, including placement of these individuals in removal proceedings. Employers of affected foreign nationals should contact their Fragomen professional or the firm’s Government Strategies and Compliance Group for counsel.

As a reminder, DHS announced that it would not extend the 2021 Venezuela TPS designation that was scheduled to expire on September 10, but would grant a transition period through November 7, 2025 for these beneficiaries.

Apple said it removed apps like ICEBlock due to the potential for risks that were raised by law enforcement.

Officials said last month that a gunman who opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas had searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.

Bondi has previously said that crowdsourced apps that allow people to communicate about the location of law enforcement officers is not allowed - specifically referring to ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron in a July interview on Fox News.

""We are looking at him and he better watch out because that's not a protected speech,"" Bondi said at the time.

But advocates say that tracking ICE activity is a form of free speech protected by the First amendment. They maintain that such platforms are primarily used among individuals looking to protect themselves from surprise raids or potential harassment from immigration officials.

The Health and Human Services Department’s Administration for Children and Families emailed migrant shelters saying children 14 years of age and older would get $2,500 each, according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.

The Trump administration offered to “provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 … to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” adding that the “benefit is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure,” according to CNN, who also reviewed a copy of the correspondence.

Children were given 24 hours to respond without penalty for declining to return to their home country, per the AP.

Shelter directors, however, were asked to acknowledge the offer within four hours.

“This voluntary option gives UACs [unaccompanied alien children] a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future,” Emily Covington, the assistant director from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Public Affairs said in a statement to The Hill.

“Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option,” she added.

Officials from ICE said the opportunity is first being offered to 17-year-olds. It follows a May offer from the Trump administration to allow adult migrants to self-deport using a government app in exchange for a $1,000 payment.

However, migrant advocates say the offer unfairly targets minors who are unable to weigh the permanent consequences of self removal.

“Voluntary departure has always been an option for unaccompanied children and when this option is explained by an attorney who has the child’s best interest in mind, the risks and benefits can be fully explored,” Neha Desai, managing director of Children’s Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, said in a statement to CNN.

“There is no legitimate reason for the government to affirmatively provide children with this option and incentivize it with a financial payoff,” Desai added.

Migrant children have faced increased uncertainty in recent months as the Trump administration attempted to revoke funding for legal aid to unaccompanied children provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.

A judge ultimately blocked the stop-work order aimed at ceasing funding for migrant youth in an effort to protect individuals under the age of 18 as outlined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.

“Children who arrive in the U.S. unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians have often survived targeted violence, abuse, persecution, or trafficking. Legal providers working with these children provide a critical safeguard in protecting them from further harm or exploitation,” the Acacia Center for Justice said in a statement.

“Particularly at a time when the administration is expediting removal proceedings that force people through our nation’s deportation system at an alarming rate, legal services for vulnerable children are more crucial than ever.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/659dc3330e1ea7.53960913-e1759529787277.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-03 19:56:35.590939

“We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock has been removed from the App Store due to ‘objectionable content’,” the app’s social media team said in a post on the platform BlueSky. “The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin. We have responded and we’ll fight this!”

The move marks a rare instance of an app being taken down due to demands from the US government, raising concerns about pressure on private companies and limits to free speech.

ICEBlock is a free iPhone-only app that allows users to anonymously report and track Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity.

It was developed in April in response to President Trump’s hardline immigration agenda and the recent increase in ICE arrests.

ICE has been a central part of Trump’s push for mass deportation since he took office for a second term. Its agents have regularly raided workplaces, homes and courthouses to arrest migrants, and rights advocates say free speech and due process are often being infringed upon in the government’s deportation drive.

Apple’s decision to remove the ICEBlock app from its platform has also shed light on the growing ties between major tech firms and the Trump administration. Many companies, including the iPhone maker, have sought to avoid clashes with a White House that has not been shy about issuing threats — particularly around tariffs — against specific firms.

“Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,” Apple said in an emailed statement.

Fox Business first reported the app’s removal on Thursday, citing a statement from US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said the Department of Justice contacted Apple and that the company complied with its request to pull the app.

“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi told Fox Business.

Joshua Aaron, the Texas-based creator of ICEBlock, disputed that characterisation and criticised Apple’s decision.

“I am incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions today. Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move,” Aaron told the Reuters news agency.

David Greene, the civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital rights group, said the move underscored a pattern of government overreach.

“It is not surprising — they have been threatening this for a while and we do expect to see more of this and other blatantly unconstitutional actions going forward,” Greene told Al Jazeera.

The Trump administration has shown “little to no regard” for the rule of law, Greene explained, pointing out that the app’s activities are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution, which enshrines the right to free speech.

He also argued that the public should know how its government is operating, particularly when it comes to sensitive issues like immigration. But, Greene added, the Trump administration has “never sincerely cared about the free flow of information”.

“Publishing truthful information about matters of public interest is worthy of the highest level of First Amendment protection, and the operations of government, and the identities of who the operators are, is certainly a matter of high public interest,” Greene said.

‘Watch out’

Bondi, however, has previously argued that Aaron is “not protected” under the Constitution and that they are looking at prosecuting him, warning him to “watch out”.

Civilian surveillance of federal immigration agents has become more assertive in recent months, as activists try to protect their communities from aggressive enforcement by ICE agents.

Since Trump returned to office, ICE has ramped up its enforcement efforts, and a bill passed in July has assured the agency of $75bn in new funding through 2029.

The agency has also arrested visa holders and permanent US residents targeted by the Trump administration over pro-Palestinian advocacy.

In one high-profile case, Mahmoud Khalil, a US resident of Palestinian origin, was arrested after serving as a spokesperson for the antiwar protests at Columbia University, a move that rights groups condemned as intimidation.

While Khalil was released from detention in June, he continues to face deportation proceedings. In September, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered his deportation, though Khalil has 30 days to appeal.

Legal experts have said that civilian surveillance of ICE is largely protected under the US Constitution, as long as observers do not try to obstruct law enforcement activities.

Apple removed more than 1,700 apps from its App Store in 2024 in response to government demands, but the vast majority of those requests — more than 1,300 — came from China.

Russia filed the second-highest number of demands, at 171, followed by South Korea with 79.

Over the last three years, the US was typically not among the countries where apps were removed due to government demands, according to company transparency reports.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Northern California alleges the federal government has threatened to withhold more than $350 million in Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency grants unless the municipalities assist in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts, as well as abandon their own diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

The San Diego City Attorney's Office says that locally, those funds support wildfire and flood prevention projects, counterterrorism emergency response efforts, port and transit security infrastructure, and fire department staffing.

The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing the federal government from imposing any such conditions and a declaration that states those conditions are unconstitutional.

Individuals will be required to obtain an approved special government interest airspace waiver to fly drones or other aircraft, the notice adds. Those found violating the restriction face risk seizure, damage or destruction of their property.

Upon inquiry, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson said measures were taken after the agency received a “credible threat of small, unmanned aircraft systems being used against law enforcement during Midway Blitz.”

Midway Blitz is an operation led by the DHS to arrest and deport immigrants in the Chicago area who lack permanent legal status.

Hundreds have been arrested at the raids, which began in early September. Local residents said they have been subject to the military’s removal of men, women and children from their apartment homes while they were naked, according to reports from WBEZ.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) said Monday that Illinois National Guard soldiers were told 100 troops would be deployed throughout the state.

Amid concerns, the Democratic governor has encouraged citizens to record military interactions to attest to their treatment.

However, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the FAA restriction may limit potential documentation for journalists and residents alike.

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction won by Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates that stopped the Republican president's executive order from taking effect.

Trump's order, issued on his first day back in office on January 20, directs agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a ""green card"" holder.

The principle of birthright citizenship has been recognized in the U.S. for more than 150 years, deriving from the 14th Amendment that states that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen.

Another appeals court, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in July similarly upheld a nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order from taking effect on the grounds that it violated the citizenship clause of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.

The administration last week asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal in that case and a related one. If the Supreme Court agrees, it would mark the second time the litigation is before the high court, after its 6 to 3 conservative majority in June limited the power of judges to block that and other actions by Trump on a nationwide basis.

The Supreme Court at that time did not weigh in on the validity of Trump's birthright citizenship order. But in three cases where judges had declared it unconstitutional, the court limited the ability of judges to issue so-called universal injunctions and directed lower courts that had blocked Trump's policy nationally to reconsider the scope of their orders.

The Supreme Court's ruling opened the door to Trump's order taking effect in parts of the country, fueling uncertainty for immigrants and states grappling with the implications of a potentially patchwork system of citizenship rules. Yet in the months since, lower-court judges have repeatedly blocked it from being implemented anywhere in the country.

The 1st Circuit was reviewing a ruling by U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, who ruled in favor of 18 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in February.

After the Supreme Court's June ruling, he reaffirmed his original decision to halt the policy nationwide.

States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year.
Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to States based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
These grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that States assist DHS in immigration enforcement.
In addition to New Jersey, this lawsuit is being co-led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha.","After leading a multi-state lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin today announced that the DOJ will remove illegal conditions on over $1.3 billion in Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants. Earlier this year, the Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, has declared that States will be unable to access these funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they accede to the Trump Administration’s demands that States assist in federal immigration enforcement.

“When the Trump Administration recklessly attempted to mistreat victims of crime in New Jersey and across the country, we took action and led a 20 Attorney General coalition to ensure continued funding under the Victims of Crime Act,” said Attorney General Platkin. “Now the Trump Department of Justice has agreed to drop illegal conditions on this critical funding, which will ensure that advocacy services, sexual assault forensic exams, medical and funeral expenses, and other critical resources for victims of crimes will continue to be available. While this fight over DOJ’s unlawful and politicized use of grant conditions is not yet over, I am glad to have achieved this significant victory for our residents alongside our coalition.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable States to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives: victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that States could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to States based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the DOJ, previously declared that States, along with the victims and survivors they serve, would be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. In order to receive these funds, States were told that they must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal, not state, government responsibility.

Following the lawsuit brought forward by the coalition, the DOJ has abandoned its plans to impose these conditions on $178 million in VOCA Victim Assistance grants and $1.2 billion in VOCA Victim Compensation grants. These grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that States assist DHS in immigration enforcement.

In addition to New Jersey, this lawsuit is being co-led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. It is joined by the Attorneys General of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

On Friday, the court’s conservative majority granted the administration’s request to put on hold a judge’s ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based District Judge Edward Chen issued at an earlier stage of the case.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the conservative majority wrote Friday in an unsigned order.

Some migrants have lost their jobs and homes, while others have been detained and deported after the justices stepped in the first time, lawyers for the migrants told the court.

The court’s three liberal justices dissented from Friday’s decision.

“I view today’s decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote. “Because, respectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent.”

Chen’s May ruling had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court. He also issued a final ruling on September 5, finding that Noem’s actions to terminate the programme had violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge also faulted Noem’s “discriminatory statements” concerning the Venezuelans, noting that she had generalised the alleged crimes of a few migrants “to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders”, calling her remarks a “classic form of racism”.

He added that members of that population “have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population”.

Chen’s ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Noem had determined their stay to be “contrary to the national interest”, according to the administration.

Trump has made cracking down on immigration – legal and illegal – a central plank of his second term as president, and he has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS programme is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients protection from deportation and access to work permits.

The US government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden’s administration announced an extension of the programme to October 2026.

Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefitted from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Chen’s final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration.

Trump officials argued that the decision amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court, given its prior action in the case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court in its filing.

Some lower courts have expressed confusion and frustration in recent weeks as they attempt to follow Supreme Court emergency orders that often are issued with little or no legal reasoning presented.

“This court’s orders are binding on litigants and lower courts. Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them – as the lower courts did here – is unacceptable,” the Justice Department said.

In another case, the Supreme Court on May 30 let the administration revoke a different type of temporary legal status, “humanitarian parole”, for 532,000 Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants.

Humanitarian parole is a form of temporary permission under US law to be in the country for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit”, allowing recipients to live and work in the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25241626462111-1759525674.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-03 18:57:44.648395

The court’s opinion was clear that Trump’s order, which denies citizenship to children born in the United States if their parents are undocumented or on temporary visas, directly conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.
“Under both the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a), such persons are citizens at birth,” the court ruled.
Multiple courts have already blocked Trump’s order as unconstitutional.
With Friday’s First Circuit ruling, the legal consensus that the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil and no president can order it away is only growing stronger.","In a major blow to President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, the First Circuit Court of Appeals flatly rejected the administration’s attempt to enforce his executive order ending birthright citizenship.

The three-judge panel unanimously refused to lift a lower court injunction, meaning the order remains blocked and federal officials are barred from enforcing the order while appeals continue.

Chief Judge David Barron, appointed by former President Barack Obama, writing for the court and joined by Judges Julie Rikelman and Seth Aframe, stressed that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves no room for Trump’s interpretation. The court’s opinion was clear that Trump’s order, which denies citizenship to children born in the United States if their parents are undocumented or on temporary visas, directly conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.

“Under both the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a), such persons are citizens at birth,” the court ruled. “We thus conclude that the plaintiffs are exceedingly likely to succeed in showing that the Executive Order conflicts with both the Citizenship Clause and § 1401(a).”

Section 1401(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act codifies birthright citizenship into federal law.

Multiple courts have already blocked Trump’s order as unconstitutional.

The Ninth Circuit, in a decision this summer, affirmed that a president “was not granted the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution” and agreed with a district court that denying citizenship to people born in the U.S. is “unconstitutional.” While in New Hampshire, a federal court certified a nationwide class action and barred enforcement, protecting “the citizenship rights of all children born on U.S. soil.”

Trump is now pinning his hopes on the Supreme Court, where his Justice Department petitioned the justices last week to overturn these lower court decisions and greenlight his order.

The case is New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support v. Donald J. Trump.

The First Circuit Court of Appeals decision stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, Asian Law Caucus, Democracy Defenders Fund, and Legal Defense Fund on behalf of New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and Make the Road New York.

This ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions rejecting President Trump’s executive order since it was signed on January 20, Inauguration Day. This lawsuit was filed within two hours of Trump signing the order. In February, the federal judge in this case temporarily blocked it from taking effect, prompting the appeal, which was heard August 1.

(In addition, the attorneys in this lawsuit filed a second related case, Barbara v. Donald J. Trump, following the Supreme Court’s June ruling limiting the use of nationwide injunctions in three other challenges to the executive order. In Barbara, a federal court certified a class of all babies subject to the executive order and blocked its enforcement against them. The government has sought Supreme Court review in Barbara, along with a case brought by Washington and other states.)

In a related decision also rejecting the Executive Order that it issued simultaneously, the First Circuit said: “The ‘lessons of history’ . . . give us every reason to be wary of now blessing this most recent effort to break with our established tradition of recognizing birthright citizenship and to make citizenship depend on the actions of one's parents rather than -- in all but the rarest of circumstances -- the simple fact of being born in the United States.”

“This ruling is the latest rebuke of President Trump’s blatantly unconstitutional efforts to end birthright citizenship,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the case. “In fact, not one judge has bought the administration’s flawed arguments. The government is now petitioning the Supreme Court in hopes of getting a different answer. But the Constitution is clear, and we will keep fighting this lawless order until it is struck down once and for all.”

“The federal appeals court today reinforced that this executive order is a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution — and we agree,” said SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire. “Our Constitution is clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship.”

“The Constitution has always been clear — if you are born here, you’re a citizen. Today’s decision upholds not just the letter of the law but also the promise of America,” said Aarti Kohli, executive director of Asian Law Caucus. “For generations, immigrant families have built lives and contributed to this country because birthright citizenship means that you belong here. We will continue fighting against this administration’s unconstitutional attempts to strip away the rights that define American citizenship.”

“This ruling is another decisive blow against the blatantly unlawful effort to gut the fundamental constitutional rights of American citizens and their immigrant families.” said Tianna Mays, legal director of Democracy Defenders Fund. “Birthright citizenship has been a clear principle of U.S. law for over a century and no president can change that with the stroke of a pen.”

“Today's decision affirms that birthright citizenship is not subject to shifting political winds. Every child born on U.S. soil is a citizen of the United States. We are incredibly pleased with the court's decision and we will continue fighting to ensure that this constitutional right is not undermined,” said Ashley Burrell, senior counsel at the Legal Defense Fund.

“As the Trump administration continues its crusade to attack immigrants, once more, this ruling affirms a constitutional right: U.S.-born children cannot be stripped of their U.S. citizenship. In recent months, we have seen this administration's repeated attempts to sidestep the Constitution, take away people’s rights, and endanger the foundations of our democracy.

That’s the same mandatory minimum imposed on people convicted for sex-trafficking children.
The bill targets offenders facing prosecution for illegally crossing the border after removal, a crime known as “illegal re-entry”.
Those figures would probably be much higher now, because the Trump administration prosecutes illegal re-entry cases more aggressively than the Biden administration did.
While the Republican-majority House of Representatives passed the bill easily, HR3486 gained less liberal backing than the last major immigration bill passed by Congress.","Republicans members of Congress have rallied behind a new approach to deterring unauthorized immigration – jailing migrants for a decade at a time.

The GOP has toyed with the idea of imposing mandatory minimums on immigration offenses for a decade, most famously with a proposal called “Kate’s Law”, which would have imposed five-year sentences on those convicted of illegal re-entry with certain criminal histories.

But the new Stop Illegal Entry Act took that idea and ran with it, imposing a mandatory minimum of five years in prison for anyone who enters the US illegally and then commits a crime punishable by more than one year in prison. For those who commit a crime punishable by up to two years in prison, the mandatory minimum jumps to 10 years. That’s the same mandatory minimum imposed on people convicted for sex-trafficking children.

The bill passed the House of Representatives on 11 September, largely along party lines, with the support of 11 Democrats and the White House. Ted Cruz, the Republican Texas senator, is now trying to shepherd the measure through the Senate.

Mike Johnson, the Republican US house speaker, applauded the bill in a statement as a “commonsense” deterrent against “those who repeatedly and deliberately violate US immigration law.”

But criminal justice groups describe the bill, HR3486, as a wildly impractical measure that would shunt tens of thousands of people into prisons for a non-violent offense over the next few years, while logjamming the federal courts – at a cost of roughly $440,000 for every person incarcerated, according to an estimate from the Federal Public and Community Defenders Legislative Committee.

The measure would impose draconian new penalties on defendants that often have urgent reasons for migrating to the US, criminal justice reformers say – like attempting to reunite with family members here or escaping violence or poverty in their country of origin.

“This is a mass incarceration bill,” said Jesse Franzblau, the associate director for policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “It’s really a handout to private prison companies just to lock up more people. It should be outright rejected by anyone who believes in any semblance of due process when it comes to immigration or law enforcement.”

HR3486 would also impact a staggering number of people. The bill targets offenders facing prosecution for illegally crossing the border after removal, a crime known as “illegal re-entry”. Under current law, crossing the border without authorization is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months for the first offense and up to two years for subsequent offenses. Federal prosecutors may also charge illegal re-entry as a felony punishable by up to two years, with enhancements that can theoretically extend the penalty up to 20 years – though in practice such prolonged sentences are rare.

It’s not entirely clear how many defendants would be subjected to mandatory minimums if HR3486 became law, but current trends indicate that the number is well into the thousands. The Federal Public and Community Defenders Legislative Committee estimated that 7,000 people would easily get slapped with 10-year mandatory minimum sentences under the proposed law, based on 2024 statistics. Those figures would probably be much higher now, because the Trump administration prosecutes illegal re-entry cases more aggressively than the Biden administration did.

The Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored HR3486. The US Sentencing Commission estimated that the comparatively modest Kate’s Law would have inflated the federal inmate population by 57,000 over five years.

It’s common for people facing illegal re-entry charges to have previous immigration convictions on their records, some of which would invoke a 10-year mandatory minimum under the proposed law. Immigration offenses account for more than half of the federal criminal caseload, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse database, with illegal entry and re-entry cases accounting for the lion’s share.

The possibility of adding thousands of new inmates to federal prisons on decade-long sentences would have a massive impact on the Bureau of Prisons, whose total inmate population stands at approximately 155,000.

“The cascading effects of subjecting thousands of individuals to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence cannot be overstated,” reads a letter to congressional leaders penned by the Federal Public and Community Defenders Legislative Committee. “The entire system would be driven by the demands of section 1326 [illegal re-entry] cases, at the expense of violent crimes and other offenses that pose a far greater threat to public safety.”

Criminal justice and legal groups also warn that the bill could paralyze the federal courts. Nearly all illegal entry and re-entry cases are convicted through plea deals with reduced sentences in order to shuttle them quickly through the system.

But it wouldn’t make sense to plead guilty to a crime carrying a 10-year mandatory prison sentence.

“If this passed, the federal courts would implode,’’ said Kara Hartzler, an attorney with Federal Defenders of San Diego. “No one would have any incentive to take a plea. Suddenly the number of cases that go to trial would just go through the roof. Any court that has a significant number of these prosecutions would just be completely overwhelmed.”

Illegal re-entry cases are prosecuted across the country, though the vast majority of defendants face charges in jurisdictions that lie near the US-Mexico border. The House version of the bill was sponsored by Republicans who in most cases live far from the courts most likely to be affected – Republican representatives Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, Ryan Zinke of Montana, Brad Knott of North Carolina, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, and Brandon Gill of Texas.

While the bill would impose massive costs, it’s unlikely to accomplish its goal, critics say. Many migrants who cross into the US are already risking their lives. A strong body of research indicates that mandatory minimums do not deter offenders, according to Liz Komar, a lawyer with the the Sentencing Project.

“When we look at the research on deterrence, it’s really about the certainty of punishment, not the severity,” Komar said. “It’s a well-established criminological principle at this point. That’s in terms of talking about actual crime, actual public safety concerns. What we’re talking about here, though, is really about migration.”

It remains to be seen whether Cruz will have enough bipartisan support to push the bill through the Senate. While the Republican-majority House of Representatives passed the bill easily, HR3486 gained less liberal backing than the last major immigration bill passed by Congress. That measure, the Laken Riley Act, garnered four dozen Democratic votes in the House and 12 Democratic votes in the Senate.

Cruz would need the support of all GOP senators, plus at least seven Democrats or independents to hit the 60-vote threshold needed to bring the Stop Illegal Entry Act to a vote on the Senate floor.

That doesn’t mean the bill is dead. Republican supporters could still find a way to tack the measure to must-pass legislation. And the fact that the bill made it this far suggests that Congress may see more attempts to saddle immigration offenses with mandatory minimums in the future, Komar said.

“Even if this bill does not progress in the Senate, it’s part of a broader trend of normalizing mandatory minimums – particularly in the context of immigration,” Komar said. “And even a more modest bill could have dramatic impacts that the Bureau of Prisons does not have the capacity to handle and which will not benefit public safety.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce0b0f58a0e622d44b875972c91db8aa2b634043/379_0_3785_3029/master/3785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df7db672bb5fef2d84a7717171612b03",N,,2025-10-03 17:57:28.710942

The justices granted the administration's request to put on hold a judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted to the migrants under Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while litigation proceeds.

The Supreme Court previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Edward Chen issued at an earlier stage of the case that had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court. Chen issued a final ruling on September 5, finding that Noem's actions to terminate the program violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

The judge also faulted Noem's ""discriminatory statements"" concerning the Venezuelans, noting that her generalization of the alleged crimes of a few migrants ""to the entire population of Venezuelan TPS holders who have lower rates of criminality and higher rates of college education and workforce participation than the general population is a classic form of racism.""

Chen's ruling meant that more than 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders would be able to remain in the country for now, even though Noem had determined that to be ""contrary to the national interest,"" according to the administration.

Trump has made cracking down on immigration - legal and illegal - a central plank of his second term as president, and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under U.S. law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

The U.S. government under Biden designated Venezuelans as eligible for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office in January, Biden's administration announced an extension of the program to October 2026.

Noem, a Trump appointee, rescinded that extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who had benefited from the 2023 designation.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put Chen's final ruling on hold, prompting criticism from the administration, which said it amounted to defiance of the Supreme Court given the prior action by the justices in the case.

The latest move appears to be an extension of ongoing efforts to repatriate migrant children in custody.
The directive marked a departure from long-standing protocol which required that federal authorities turn over most unaccompanied children to HHS.
Federal authorities previously didn’t ask unaccompanied kids from countries other than Mexico and Canada if they wanted to self deport.
The efforts to repatriate migrant children who are in immigration proceedings to determine whether they have protections in the US have sparked alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys.","The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers in the United States the option to voluntarily leave the country and receive a $2,500 payment, according to three sources familiar with the plans and an administration memo obtained by CNN.

The Trump administration has already been offering financial incentives — including a $1,000 exit bonus — to undocumented adult immigrants in the US to depart the country. Administration officials have argued that self-deportation incentives are more cost effective, given the high price tag of immigrant detention and deportation.

A notice sent to legal service providers Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services, seen by CNN, said the administration “will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 U.S. Dollars to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” adding that the “benefit is intended to support reintegration efforts following departure.”

The voluntary option is expected to first be offered to 17-year-old migrants and would need to be approved by an immigration judge. The payment would be given once the migrants arrive in their home country.

CNN reached out to HHS, which is charged with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. HHS referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families. This voluntary option gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future,” an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, referring to unaccompanied migrant children.

“Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option,” the spokesperson added.

Trump administration officials have increasingly focused on migrant children who arrived in the US southern border alone and are awaiting to be placed with a sponsor, typically a parent or relative, in the United States. As of October 2, there were around 2,100 kids in HHS custody.

The latest move appears to be an extension of ongoing efforts to repatriate migrant children in custody. In late August, the Trump administration prepared dozens of Guatemalan children to be sent back to their home country — a move that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Declarations from some parents of the children in Guatemala revealed that they were unaware their child was being deported and raised concern over their safety if returned. That case is ongoing.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which has been in place for more than two decades, provides protections for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive and reside in the US, including being screened to see if they are victims of human trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution in their home country.

Generally, kids in custody are not affirmatively offered the option to leave voluntarily, and those who request it must have it approved by an immigration judge. ICE said kids, in this case, will also go before an immigration judge, who are there to ensure the child knows what it means, are making the choice of their own free will, and aren’t being put in harm’s way.

“Voluntary departure has always been an option for unaccompanied children and when this option is explained by an attorney who has the child’s best interest in mind, the risks and benefits can be fully explored. There is no legitimate reason for the government to affirmatively provide children with this option and incentivize it with a financial payoff,” said Neha Desai, managing director of Children’s Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law, in a statement.

Earlier this year, the administration separately moved to rapidly deport some migrant children who arrived in the US without a parent or guardian by having federal agents ask teens whether they want to voluntarily depart the country.

The directive marked a departure from long-standing protocol which required that federal authorities turn over most unaccompanied children to HHS. Federal authorities previously didn’t ask unaccompanied kids from countries other than Mexico and Canada if they wanted to self deport.

The efforts to repatriate migrant children who are in immigration proceedings to determine whether they have protections in the US have sparked alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys.

While immigrant advocates maintain that child safety should be a priority, particularly when dealing with vulnerable migrant children, they argue that the Trump administration’s policies risk doing more harm than good if they result in kids being sent back to dangerous conditions.

The administration has also implemented additional vetting checks and other protocols prior to releasing a child from custody that have prolonged their stays in shelters.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2021-03-12t180113z-1405354606-rc2u9m9wjuhn-rtrmadp-3-usa-immigration-children.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-03 17:57:43.015461

""It's an injustice what's happening to all of us Latinos, with brown skin,"" Garcia Venegas said.","An Alabama man is suing the Trump administration after immigration agents arrested him twice in three weeks despite having a valid REAL ID and U.S. citizenship.

The new lawsuit alleges that masked immigration agents are targeting people based on their race, ethnicity or occupation and terrorizing U.S. citizens who fit a certain profile.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that ""allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE.""

Reports of Americans being detained in President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown are rising, from the Iraq War veteran held for three days in Southern California to the citizens whose apartments were ransacked in a recent Chicago raid.

""I'm suing because it's not right what they did to me,"" Leonardo Garcia Venegas told USA TODAY. ""I don't want it to happen to anyone else.""

The lawsuit is asking a judge to block DHS policies that allegedly permit agents to target people on private property without a warrant, who fit a racial or ethnic profile. Garcia Venegas is also seeking unspecified damages.

Detained while working construction

The 25-year-old construction worker said he was preparing to lay the foundation for a new home in Foley, Alabama, on May 21 when five agents in camouflage – three wearing masks – rushed onto the worksite around 8 a.m.

There were two crews on site, according to the complaint filed Sept. 30 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.

Five Latino men, including Garcia Venegas, were there to set the foundation. A separate crew of two Black men and two white men were there to deliver the concrete.

The complaint alleges that, without a warrant, ""officers ran right past the white and Black workers … and went straight for the Latino workers.""

When Garcia Venegas started filming the arrests with his cellphone, an agent grabbed him by the arm and forced him to the ground. Two more agents rushed over and held him to the ground.

He shouted that he was an American citizen: ""I'll show you my papers now,"" he told them, according to the complaint.

The first agent fished Garcia Venegas' wallet out of his pocket and found his REAL ID, an active driver's license only available to U.S. citizens and lawful residents, compliant with federal guidelines. According to the complaint, agents alleged the ID was fake and held him in handcuffs for more than an hour.

The ID was genuine, and the agents released him.

Then it happened again

Still, the encounter shook him enough that he stayed home from work for days, according to the complaint.

Garcia Venegas was born in Florida but spent much of his childhood in Mexico, with his parents, before he returned to the U.S. for high school. He is dark-skinned, still more comfortable in Spanish than English. He feared those characteristics could make him a target.

Not two weeks after he returned, it happened again.

On June 12, Garcia Venegas was working inside a partially finished home, headphones on, listening to music while he finished a job.

Agents ""spotted Leo working through the bedroom window, thought he fit DHS's generalized profile of an undocumented worker … and (an agent) entered the home through an unlocked door,"" according to the complaint.

Agents allegedly entered the private property without a warrant.

They led Garcia Venegas outside; he showed them his Alabama-issued REAL ID and, again, they said it could be fake. They marched him to their vehicle and detained him for 30 minutes before determining his REAL ID was authentic.

McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said DHS ""enforces federal immigration law without fear, favor or prejudice.""

""What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. – NOT their skin color, race or ethnicity,"" McLaughlin said. ""Under the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses 'reasonable suspicion' to make arrests. There are no 'indiscriminate stops' being made.""

Immigration enforcement stirs fears

Situated along Alabama's Gulf Coast near white-sand beaches, once-rural Baldwin County is one of the fast-growing areas in the state, with a population that jumped 66% in two decades to more than 260,000 people, according to the Baldwin County Economic Development Alliance.

Residential construction is booming, and Garcia Venegas has had work nonstop since he went into construction full-time five years ago.

But the continuous immigration raids are chilling the business climate, said Grace Resendez McCaffery, publisher of La Costa Latina, a Spanish-language newspaper distributed in Baldwin and nearby counties.

Even American workers who are Hispanic fear going to jobs in industries that may be perceived by authorities as having undocumented workers, like construction sites and restaurants, she said.

""You are left to prove you are not undocumented,"" she said.

""We've seen where American citizens are being handcuffed and detained on site until the ICE agents determine they won't take them,"" she said. ""At one point are they going to believe you? If you went through the process of getting a REAL ID, which is supposed to be unquestionable identification, still how can you trust you will be believed?""

When a valid REAL ID isn't enough

It's a question Garcia Venegas has had to ask himself.

Alabama's REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 in a legislative package that included some of the most stringent, anti-illegal immigration provisions in the country. To get his REAL ID, Garcia Venegas had to present government documents to verify his Social Security number and U.S. citizenship.

What more could he do to prove his citizenship?

""It's an injustice what's happening to all of us Latinos, with brown skin,"" Garcia Venegas said. ""It's racism. They've got to stop.""

Trump notified Congress this week that he has “determined” that the U.S. is at war with drug cartels in Latin America. The U.S. killed another four people in another strike in the Caribbean on Friday.

Of course, Trump has no authority to simply “determine” that the U.S. is at war — particularly not against gangs that experts say don’t even constitute armed groups under international law.

The people Trump has targeted in the Caribbean are at most criminal suspects, not “enemy combatants.” These killings are murder, and Congress must exert its authority to stop them.

Here at home, Trump is waging a “war from within,” as he put it, telling military leaders on Tuesday he plans to use American cities as “training grounds” for foreign wars.

The administration announced that it is deploying more troops onto our streets, this time to Portland, as ICE continues military-style raids that are terrorizing communities around the country.

As part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago this week, armed ICE agents in military fatigues descended on an apartment building from a Black Hawk helicopter, throwing stun grenades and dragging entire families out onto the streets in zip ties in the middle of the night.

“They just treated us like we were nothing,” one resident said. “It felt like we were under siege,” another witness recalled.

Meanwhile, Trump has issued new directives cracking down on his political opponents under the guise of combating “domestic terrorism” and political violence.

This week, Trump unveiled a presidential memorandum granting his administration sweeping authority to prosecute groups it deems are anti-American, anti-capitalist, or anti-Christian, or hold “extremist” views on issues like gender, race, and migration justice.

Already, the administration is targeting the Open Society Foundations, which has supported a wide range of human rights and democracy initiatives nationally and globally, including FCNL’s work.

With the twin threats of authoritarianism and militarism on the rise, we will continue to speak out in solidarity with those being targeted and to urge Congress to act with moral courage to defend democracy, peace, and human dignity.

Shutdown is a Moment of Moral Reckoning

The federal government shutdown on Wednesday, October 1 after Congress failed to pass spending legislation to fund essential programs and services. Now people are suffering and the Trump administration is illegally slashing funding and firing people.

As FNCL General Secretary Bridget Moix put it, “This is a moment of moral reckoning.”

Here are three things you can do to call on your members of Congress to negotiate an end to the shutdown:

Remembering the Trauma of Indian Boarding Schools

This past week, September 30, the U.S. and Canada observed Orange Shirt Day, a day of remembrance for Indian Boarding Schools. For over a hundred years, the U.S. government ripped Native children from their homes and sent them to abusive “boarding schools,” many of which were run by churches. This attempted forced assimilation sought to erase Native identity, languages, and cultures. Many of these children never came home.

Contact your members of Congress today to urge them to act on legislation that could bring a measure of truth and healing from Native Boarding Schools!

World Quaker Day: Love Your Neighbor

World Quaker Day is coming up this Sunday, October 5, with the theme of Love Your Neighbor – mirroring FCNL’s core message: “Love Thy Neighbors (no exceptions).” A lecture from FCNL’s Alicia McBride explores more deeply what love of neighbor can look like in this present political moment.

The court on Oct. 3 paused a federal judge's September ruling that the administration had wrongly ended a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States amid perilous conditions back home.

The high court also sided with the administration at an earlier stage in the case. In May, the justices lifted a California federal judge's temporary order, keeping the program in place while the case is litigated.

In a brief, unsigned order, the court on Oct. 3 said that while the posture of the case has changed, the legal arguments and balance of potential harms to both sides have not.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the court said.

The court’s three liberal justices said they would have rejected the administration’s request.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissenting opinion, called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“Because, re­spectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous, and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent,” she wrote.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said that the lower courts were disregarding the Supreme Court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said when asking the court in September to pause the judge’s ruling. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision did not explain why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said the courts now have more evidence to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security had run a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

“This case is about whether a federal agency acted outside the scope of its delegated authority and contrary to the procedures Congress required it to follow,” lawyers for the advocacy group and the Venezuelans challenging the administration’s actions told the Supreme Court.

The lawyers also said the court should let the appeals process play out before intervening since the justices didn’t get involved during the Biden administration when a judge temporarily halted some of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.

""Our presence here is not an emergency, no matter what the government says,"" said one of the Venezuelans, identified as M.H., who is married to a U.S. citizen and has two children.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

When the Supreme Court, in May, allowed the administration to end deportation protections temporarily, thousands of families were torn apart, lawyers for the National TPS Alliance told the Supreme Court in September.

“People lost their jobs, were jailed, and ultimately deported to a country that remains extremely unsafe,” they wrote.

More would be at risk of detention and deportation, they said, if the court again sides with the administration.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/19/USAT/86247320007-usatsi-27033472-168410238-lowres.jpg?crop=1408,793,x0,y100&width=1408&height=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-03 17:57:35.771542

San Francisco, CA — A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations filed suit today to stop President Trump’s latest anti-immigration power grab: a sweeping executive action that slaps an unlawful new $100,000 price tag on every new H-1B application. The proclamation – issued on September 19, 2025, and made effective just 36 hours later – has already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.

The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent — such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers — after a rigorous review process.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St. Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.

These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.

Plaintiff and co-counsel’s quotes can be found here.

When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.

The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:

Defies Congress: The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.

Invites chaos and favoritism: The order offers a vague “national interest” loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.

Hurts communities nationwide: Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can’t absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.

Undermines the economy: Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations—and good jobs—overseas.

Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators. The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.

Across Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed 22 Palestinians, including 16 in Gaza City, since dawn. A newborn baby died in Gaza City’s Al-Helou Hospital as infants were being evacuated to escape Israel’s onslaught. Al Jazeera is reporting that at least seven people were killed in southern Gaza’s al-Mawasi area that Israel designated as a safe zone.

It comes as Médecins Sans Frontières denounced the killing of its 14th staff member in Gaza, occupational therapist Omar Hayek. Meanwhile, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder recounted harrowing conditions at Al-Aqsa Hospital.

James Elder: “This is just absolutely out of control. I promised myself the first story about being in Gaza would be just some of the incredible volunteers and the joy they bring to kids, even in hospitals. And I’m here.

It comes as Hamas is reportedly demanding key revisions to President Trump’s ceasefire deal. A Hamas source tells The Guardian that the condition to disarm would be difficult for the group to accept.

Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunted the Global Sumud Flotilla activists taken into custody by Israel on Thursday, pointing at them and calling them “terrorists.” Reporters Without Borders said that there were more than 20 foreign reporters on board the flotilla.

Meanwhile, demonstrators took to the streets all over the world, from Karachi, Pakistan, to Barcelona, Spain, in response to Israel capturing more than 450 activists. Italian students occupied universities, and Italian unions called a general strike for Friday with more than 100 marches expected across the country. Protesters also took to the streets of Athens, Greece.

Georgia Bozioti: “We demand that all the participants who were there be freed now. We are here to shout again for freedom to Palestine, and we demand that our country stop any cooperation with the murderous state of Israel, which has been intensifying the genocide of the Palestinian people with the support of the United States, NATO and the European Union.”

We’ll get an update on the Global Sumud Flotilla later in the broadcast.

Here in New York, more than 1,000 rabbis and Jewish peace activists led a protest Thursday demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. arms transfers to Israel. They gathered at Brooklyn Borough Hall for a mass public memorial service on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, known as the Day of Atonement. Nearly 60 people were arrested as they nonviolently blocked traffic to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is New York City comptroller — and ally of mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — Brad Lander.

Brad Lander: “We must today take collective responsibility for what the Israeli government has been doing, is doing today, on Yom Kippur, says, makes clear it is going to keep doing to Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank also, the bombs funded by our taxpayer dollars in the name of the Jewish state, but a desecration of Judaism.”

President Trump has embraced the government shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to punish his political opponents while slashing the federal workforce and cutting off funding to whole government agencies. On Thursday, Trump said budget chief Russell Vought will have the power to decide if cuts should be “temporary or permanent.” And he said he would continue to target projects and agencies favored by Democrats.

President Donald Trump: “Well, there could be firings, and that’s their fault. And it could also be other things. I mean, we could cut projects that they wanted, favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

Democrats are demanding the reversal of cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that will result in some 15 million people losing their health insurance coverage over the next decade. This is House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “This is day two of Donald Trump’s shutdown, but it is day 256 of the chaos that the Trump presidency has unleashed on the American people. Republicans have shut the government down because they don’t want to provide healthcare to working-class Americans.”

Meanwhile, the Labor Department will delay publication of its monthly jobs report that was scheduled for release today. It was expected to show a slowdown in hiring in September. Economist Erica Groshen, who formerly led the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told The Washington Post, “It’s a bad time to be missing data. We are flying blind right as the economy could be turning.”

In California, a massive explosion tore through a Chevron oil refinery in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo Thursday evening, sparking a fire that burned through the night and could be seen from miles away. The explosion occurred around 9:30 p.m. and prompted shelter-in-place orders until 2 a.m. No injuries have been reported. This comes as the Trump administration has moved to shut down the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent federal agency tasked with uncovering the causes of industrial disasters.

The Trump administration is asking nine public and private universities to sign a deal to help promote conservative ideas on campus in exchange for federal funding. The administration is calling it a 10-point “compact” and promised “substantial and meaningful federal grants” if universities take action against academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”

The Trump administration is also demanding that the universities ban the use of race or sex in hiring or admissions and cap foreign students to 15% of undergraduates. Walt Heinecke, a faculty member at the University of Virginia, one of the universities targeted by the Trump administration, warned that the memo threatens academic freedom.

Walt Heinecke: “It’s a threat. And it’s a threat that should be taken seriously and should be reacted to in a way in which I think all colleges and universities who this is — this is meant to actually be applied later to all universities and colleges, not just to the nine or 10 that have received the letter. So, that means that we should all be thinking about how to resist this particular form of intrusion.”

On Thursday California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned administrators against signing trump’s 10-point “compact.” Newsom wrote on social media, “If any California university signs this radical agreement, they’ll lose billions in state funding—including Cal Grants—instantly. California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom.”

A federal court in Georgia has denied an emergency request by the award-winning Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to remain in the United States, paving the way for his deportation to El Salvador today. According to the ACLU, Guevara was not allowed to say goodbye to his wife and three children. Guevara has lived in the United States for some 20 years and has built a large following for his reporting on anti-ICE protests. He was jailed by ICE for more than 100 days, even though an immigration judge granted him bond. He was arrested in June while live-streaming a “No Kings” demonstration, even though he clearly identified himself as a journalist. We’ll have more on his case after headlines.

President Trump is declaring that the U.S. is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, following recent strikes on boats in the Caribbean — that’s according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press. The memo also states, “The United States has now reached a critical point where we must use force in self-defense and defense of others against the ongoing attacks by these designated terrorist organizations.” It comes after the U.S. attacked three boats in the Caribbean last month, reportedly killing 17 people. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino blasted the U.S. Thursday after detecting five F-35 fighter jets close to the Venezuelan coast.

Vladimir Padrino López: “The presence of these aircraft flying near our area of influence, nearby the Caribbean Sea and off the Venezuelan coast, is a vulgarity and a threat to national security. It is a serious threat. So I denounce before the world the military harassment and the military threat from the United States government against the people of Venezuela, who only want peace, work and happiness.”

The United Nations is calling for urgent action to prevent large-scale, ethnically driven atrocities in El Fasher, the besieged capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state. On Thursday, the U.N.’s top human rights official warned at least 91 civilians were killed in El Fasher last month, as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, carried out artillery shelling, drone strikes and ground incursions. The U.N. also warned the RSF against starving civilians in El Fasher as a method of warfare, amid credible reports of civilians being tortured and killed by RSF fighters for bringing food and essential supplies into the city.

British police have identified the suspect who drove a car at members of the public outside a Manchester synagogue on Thursday before attacking people with a knife. Thirty-five-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie was a British citizen of Syrian descent. He was shot dead by firearms officers just minutes after the rampage began. Manchester police report one of the two victims killed in the attack was hit by police gunfire, and one of the three people hospitalized was struck by a bullet fired by police.

On the third day of the shutdown, another Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed on a 54-44 tally — well short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster and pass the legislation. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the chamber would close for legislative business next week, a move meant to force the Senate to work with the government funding bill that has been passed by House Republicans.

Following the failed vote, senators quickly headed for the exits of the Capitol, expecting no more votes over the weekend and showing few signs of any real progress towards ending the congressional standoff. Instead, both sides dug in for a prolonged shutdown fight that thrusts federal workers into more uncertainty, threatens to ripple into the broader economy and gives the Trump administration an opportunity to reshape the federal government.

“I don’t know how many times you’re going to give them a chance to vote no,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a news conference Friday. After the vote, he said he was flying home to South Dakota for the weekend, adding, “I’ll be available.”

The vote showed hardening lines in the Senate. The same three members of the Democratic Caucus — Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman and Angus King — who voted for the funding bill previously did so again, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was once again the only Republican opposed.

“They thought they could bludgeon us and threaten us and scare us. It ain’t working,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

Democrats are demanding that Congress extend healthcare benefits, while Republicans are refusing to commit to anything until the government is reopened. They are trying to wear Democrats down to vote for a House-passed bill that would reopen the government temporarily, mostly at current spending levels.

Although Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Senate’s filibuster rules make it necessary for the government funding legislation to gain support from at least 60 of the 100 senators. That’s given Democrats a rare opportunity to use their 47 Senate seats to hold out in exchange for policy concessions. The party has chosen to rally on the issue of health care, believing it could be key to their path back to power in Washington.

Their primary demand is that Congress extend tax credits that were boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic for health care plans offered under marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.

“Everyone is about to experience dramatically increased premiums, co-pays and deductibles because of the Republican health care crisis. Everyone,” warned House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries during a news conference Friday.

The shutdown gamble

Democrats are running the high-risk strategy of effectively voting for a government shutdown to make their stand. Trump has vowed to make it as painful as possible for them.

The Republican president has called the government funding lapse an “unprecedented opportunity” to make vast cuts to federal agencies and potentially lay off federal workers, rather than the typical practice of furloughing them. Trump shared a social media video Thursday night that depicted White House budget director Russ Vought as a grim reaper.

Vought has already announced that he is withholding billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in states with Democratic senators, and on Friday morning, he said he would withhold another $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects to extend its train system to the city’s South Side.

Democratic leaders have displayed no signs of budging under those threats.

“The cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,” Jeffries said during an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol Thursday evening.

Still, the shutdown, no matter how long it lasts, could have far-reaching effects on the economy. Roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and they could lose out on $400 million in daily wages. That loss in wages until after the government reopens could drive down wider demand for goods and services.

“All around the country right now, real pain is being endured by real people because the Democrats have decided to play politics,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday.

The White House also began its press briefing on Friday by rattling off the various consequences of the shutdown that were already hitting Americans. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed a report that said military families are already seeking food aid as troops go without a paycheck.

“This madness must end,” she said.

Talks in the Senate

A bipartisan group of senators, including moderate Democrats who have said they want to find a quick resolution, has been discussing possible health care compromises through one-on-one talks over the last two days. One option floated by South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, would extend the higher subsidies for one year and then phase them out to pre-pandemic levels.

Thune acknowledged those conversations on Friday, telling reporters, “Honestly, I think the more productive conversations are happening outside of the leader’s office at the moment.”

Thune and Schumer later spoke briefly on the Senate floor. The Republican leader expressed some openness to talks on the ACA subsidies, but insisted “we can’t get to that conversation until we get the government back into place.”

A number of Republicans have voiced support for extending the subsidies. Their expiration would cause significant increases in health care premiums for plenty of people in states with GOP senators — especially in rural areas where farmers, ranchers and small business owners purchase their own health insurance.

Still, it was unclear if they would be able to find a solution that could appease the White House and Republican leaders, who want to see cuts to the subsidies. Thune also said he wasn’t sure if a compromise would have the votes to pass.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Friday that “more reforms are coming” to the ACA subsidies and argued that they “are not working.”

Schumer also said that he’s supportive of the informal talks, but “unfortunately, last night,” Democrats returned from the discussions and said Republicans didn’t offer them anything.

“You need Trump to get it done,” he said.

In the memo, the White House accused congressional Democrats of wanting to repeal those policy reforms as a condition to keep the government running.
""But the White House makes the claim that California uses the money they get from the provider tax to pay for care for undocumented immigrants,"" Tolbert said.
What's more, California is among several states that offer some level of Medicaid coverage to all immigrants regardless of status.","Of all the finger-pointing and recriminations that come with the current federal government shutdown, one of the most striking elements is that the Trump administration blames it on Democratic support for granting taxpayer-funded healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants. The White House has called out California specifically, saying the state exploits a legal ""loophole"" to pay for that coverage with federal dollars, and other states have followed suit.

""California utilized an egregious loophole — since employed by several other states — to draw down federal matching funds used to provide Medicaid benefits for illegal immigrants,"" the White House said in a policy memo released Wednesday as a budget stalemate forced a shutdown of the U.S. government.

The administration said that the Working Families Tax Cut Act, which goes into effect in October 2026, closes the loophole by prohibiting the use of taxpayer money to provide healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants and other noncitizens.

In the memo, the White House accused congressional Democrats of wanting to repeal those policy reforms as a condition to keep the government running.

Izzy Gardon, a spokeswoman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said there's nothing to the administration's underlying assertion that California and other states have found some sort of loophole that enables them to funnel Medicaid money to noncitizens.

""This is false — CA does not do this,"" Gardon said in a one-line email to the L.A. Times.

Healthcare policy experts agree. California is not exploiting a “loophole,” said Adriana Ramos-Yamamoto, a senior policy analyst at the California Budget & Policy Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that studies inequality.

""The state is making lawful, transparent budget choices to invest in health coverage with its own dollars,"" Ramos-Yamamoto said in a statement to The Times. ""These investments improve health outcomes, strengthen communities, and lower health care costs in the long run.”

At issue is Section 71117 of the Republican-backed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which imposes nearly $1 trillion in reductions to federal Medicaid healthcare spending for low-income Americans over the next 10 years. The provision allows states ""to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid spending through multiple sources, including state general funds, healthcare related taxes (or 'provider taxes'), and local government funds,"" as long as taxes on healthcare providers are imposed uniformly so as not to unfairly burden providers of Medicaid services.

The bottom line, analysts said, is the administration is citing a problem with the law that doesn't seem to exist, at least not in California.

""The so-called California loophole references a provision in the law that ends a waiver of the uniformity requirements for provider taxes — this provision has nothing to do with using federal funds to pay for care for undocumented immigrants,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, a healthcare expert at the nonprofit healthcare research, polling and news organization KFF.

""But the White House makes the claim that California uses the money they get from the provider tax to pay for care for undocumented immigrants,"" Tolbert said.

Fact-checking the administration's claim is all the more difficult because there are no official data on how states spend money collected from provider taxes, Alice Burns, another KFF analyst, added. What's more, California is among several states that offer some level of Medicaid coverage to all immigrants regardless of status. And because California cannot be federally reimbursed for healthcare spending on people who are not in the country legally, those expenses must be covered at the state level.

The White House memo goes on to claim that if Democrats were to succeed at repealing the provisions in the Working Families Tax Act, the federal government would have to spend an additional $34.6 billion in taxpayer money ""that would continue to primarily be abused by California to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants.""

This assertion also misconstrues the facts, according to KFF.

""What we do know is that the $35 billion in savings that is referenced in the White House Fact Sheet refers to the federal government's estimated savings ... resulting from states making changes to their provider tax systems,"" KFF spokesperson Tammie Smith said. That is, the projected savings aren't connected to healthcare for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Political squabbling aside, California's approach to medical coverage for low-income, undocumented immigrants is set to undergo a major shift thanks to provisions in the 2025-26 state budget that the Democrat-led legislature and Newsom approved in June.

Starting on Jan. 1, adults ""who do not have Satisfactory Immigration Status (SIS)"" will no longer be able to enroll in Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, according to the state's Department of Health Care Services webpage. Those who already have this coverage can keep it and continue to renew their enrollment. And starting on July 1, Medi-Cal enrollees who are age 19-59, undocumented and not pregnant will have to pay a $30 monthly premium to keep their coverage.

The changes, which Newsom called for in the spring to offset a ballooning Medi-Cal budget deficit, drew criticism from some immigrant rights groups, with the California Immigrant Policy Center describing the moves as ""discriminatory.""

“In light of the militarized mass immigration raids and arrests causing fear and chaos across California, we are disappointed that the governor and the leadership in the Legislature chose to adopt a state budget that makes our communities even more vulnerable,” Masih Fouladi, the center's executive director said at the time.

Everyone in California who qualifies for Medi-Cal will still be eligible to receive emergency medical and dental care, no matter their immigration status.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/9be350abba70497f464a714efe11f248,N,,2025-10-03 19:56:45.638619

Vought said the money for major projects on Chicago’s subway mass transit system – including extensions of the Red Line route and modernizations “have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting”.

On Wednesday, Vought said the Trump administration had frozen $18bn for major transit projects in New York, too, including a rail tunnel under the Hudson River that flows between New York from New Jersey, and an extension of the Second Avenue subway underground rail system, citing the same justification.

The outgoing administration of former president Joe Biden finalized a nearly $2bn award of federal funds in its final days to help extend the Red Line 5.5 miles to connect Chicago far South Side to the main subway rail system, known locally as the “L”, for elevated, as a lot of the lines run overground and above the streets in the downtown area.

Vought cited a new rule from the US transportation department that took effect on Wednesday to review whether any small-business contractors are engaged in what the White House would regard as improper diversity initiatives. This is one of a series of efforts intended to pressure Democratic lawmakers in the US Congress over the partial government shutdown that began just after midnight on Wednesday.

Any substantive delays in federal funding over partisan political squabbles are almost certain to face swift legal challenges.

In New York, the $17.2bn Hudson River tunnel project, which received more than $11bn in federal grants, involves repairs to an existing tunnel, and the building of a new one for passenger railway operator Amtrak and commuter lines between New Jersey and Manhattan.

Any failure of the current Hudson tunnel, which was heavily damaged by 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, would hobble commuting in the metropolitan area that produces 10% of US economic output.

In a separate move on Friday, the Trump administration reversed its plan to cut $187m in security funds for New York, said Kathy Hochul, the state’s Democratic governor.

CHICAGO — Federal agents — with the Homeland Security secretary and a right-wing social media influencer in tow — raided an Austin Walmart on Friday. Elsewhere, they handcuffed an alderperson and lobbed tear gas onto a Logan Square street while neighbors stood nearby.

Residents in and around the Chicago area on Friday noticed a flurry of ICE activity as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign barreled into its second month.

Marcus, an employee who witnessed the raid at the Walmart at 4650 W. North Ave. before noon Friday, said that it almost made him take the rest of the day off.

“It’s terrible, man,” he said. “Tons of cars just pulled up speeding and there was a ton of yelling and commotion. They just grabbed a random shopper.”

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem participated in the raid, and Benny Johnson, a right-wing social media influencer, could be embedded with federal agents as he filmed content for his X account.

“They rolled up a couple of guys and it’s rowdy,” Johnson said in one video, smiling. “… The Secretary for Homeland Security is right now doing raids at Walmart.”

In Humboldt Park, agents handcuffed Ald. Jessie Fuentes (26th) as she confronted them Friday at Humboldt Park Hospital. Agents handcuffed Fuentes, forced her out of the hospital and threatened her with arrest, Fuentes told a Block Club reporter. The agents appeared to be with ICE, she said. Fuentes was there asking agents if they had a signed warrant and telling the agents a man — who they had detained — has constitutional rights.

In another incident caught on video Friday, federal agents inside a car threw tear gas and what appeared to be smoke grenades into a Logan Square street while people were outside nearby. Bystanders included a couple and their 2-year-old who briefly got caught in the smoke as they pushed the child in their stroller after school.

Agents Again Attack Protesters Outside Broadview ICE Facility

Federal agents led by border patrol chief Gregory Bovino attacked protesters Friday morning outside the suburban Broadview ICE facility.

At one point, a Block Club reporter saw an agent put his hands on the neck of a priest while pushing him.

The Rev. Michael Woolf, of Lake Street Church in Evanston, was protesting outside the facility when an agent attacked him while pushing protesters, he said.

“Around 50 to 100 of them basically marched down for a photo op,” Woolf said. “And all of a sudden, now we need to clear out. And then they just started using their gloves and pushing.

“One person grabbed my nipple and twisted, and then they put their hands on my throat. They were not gentle. … I’m completely peaceable. I’m a pastor. I’m committed to nonviolence.”

The violence is the latest assault on people who have been protesting the Trump Administration’s operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which have targeted people in and around Chicago.

Protesters have been gathering outside the facility for weeks, hoping to pressure the government into ending the operations and to stop cars that go into and out of the ICE facility at 1930 Beach St. in Broadview.

Federal agents have repeatedly tear gassed and shot pepper bells and rubber bullets at the protesters — even as Broadview officials have demanded they stop and said the agents are harming local police officers, firefighters, paramedics and neighbors.

On Thursday night, Illinois State Police announced the agency would send first responders to Friday morning’s protest to keep people out of the street near the facility to “support the safety of the public,” according to a news release.

Officers put that into effect early Friday, trying to keep protesters off the street. Demonstrators accused officers of assisting ICE; about 8:45 a.m., when some protesters tried to block federal vehicles’ entrance into the facility, officers hit them with batons and pushed them to the ground. State and local police took several protesters into custody.

“It’s a f—king outrageous escalation by the state of Illinois,” said protester Michael Boyte after a peaceful but tense exchange with an officer. “What [the state] should be doing is getting in the way of these kidnappings. Instead, the state of Illinois has sent the Illinois State Police. This is supposed to be a sanctuary state. JB Pritzker goes on TV every other day talking about how evil Trump is, but the State Police are collaborating with ICE.”

A Lenco BearCat vehicle repeatedly circled protesters Friday morning, while agents in technical gear clung to the military truck’s sides. Federal agents and state troopers were armed with pepper ball guns while some officers from the state’s tactical unit held M-4 rifles.

Shortly afterward, at 9 a.m., Bovino came outside of the facility with a group of federal agents. He yelled at protesters that this would be their one warning — and then he and the agents walked toward protesters, who were not in the street.

Protesters yelled at Bovino and the agents, telling them to quit their jobs. The agents grabbed several protesters and pushed some to the ground. They detained at least two people.

During the incident, drones circled overhead, people with the federal agents recorded video. Before Johnson, the social media influencer embedded with agents Friday, followed Noem to the Walmart raid, he could be seen nearby filming content for his X account.

Bovino and Border Patrol have been staging photo ops in the city to produce social media videos. It was not clear why Border Patrol would be involved with responding to protesters.

Agents had not used tear gas, rubber bullets or pepper balls on protesters as of about 9:45 a.m., but they were seen putting on gas masks.

At least five people were arrested and charged for incidents stemming from the protest, according to a Cook County Sheriff’s Office news release.

Around 11 a.m., protesters began to trickle out of the area and federal agents dispersed accordingly. State Riot Police arrived about 11:15 a.m., to the confusion of the roughly 20 protesters still ambling about the otherwise anonymous patch of grass in front of the Orkin warehouse at 2000 S. 25th Ave. Officers held their riot shields at a rest position as the stragglers heckled them.

The Trump administration said Operations Midway Blitz and At Large are focused on arresting and removing undocumented immigrants with serious criminal histories — but federal agents have repeatedly detained U.S. citizens, including children, and immigrants with proper status.

One demonstrator who identified himself on Friday as “Tony Montana” wore a traditional indigenous poncho while bellowing “Get off my land! This isn’t your’s! We were here first!” at several federal officers, including one border patrol agent who appeared visibly moved by some of Montana’s appeals to his humanity.

“You look like me,” Montana told the officer. “What if your daughter was kidnapped by these people? What would you do?”

“Well, I’d probably not just be yelling about it at people,” the border patrol agent replied. “I’d get out there and actually do something about it.”

Happening In Chicago

At 8:20 a.m. Friday, ICE and Border Patrol agents in green uniforms were seen detaining two people near the intersection of North Avers and West Montrose avenues. Neighbors were asked to be on the lookout for a White Chrysler Pacifica with Illinois plates beginning with 24939, according to Northwest Side Rapid Response team.

An older Korean man was taken by three ICE agents around 7 a.m. Friday near the intersection of West Leland and North Knox avenues.

A man was taken by three ICE agents around 9:20 a.m. Friday near the intersection of North Tripp and Fullerton avenues.

A street vendor was questioned by “three masked agents” around 9:55 a.m. Friday near the intersection of North Lockwood and West Fullerton avenues.

Organizers across the Southwest Side reported “multiple abductions” Friday morning, according to the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and Southwest Side Rapid Response.

Three people were detained by federal agents around 8 a.m. near West 43rd Street and South Christiana Avenue.

As of 11:30 a.m., agents have been seen along large roads including Archer Avenue, Western Boulevard, 47th Street and Pulaski Road. At least five people have been detained across the Back of the Yards, Brighton Park and West Lawn neighborhoods.

At 9:13 a.m., ICE agents appeared to have detained someone at The Home Depot, 4555 S Western Blvd., in Back of the Yards.

At 9:23 a.m., ICE agents appear to have detained someone at a shuttered Walgreens parking lot, 1614 W. 47th St., in Back of the Yards.

At 10:10 a.m., federal agents were “threatening and throwing a smoke bomb” at people before detaining someone near West 51st Street and South Damen Avenue.

At 11:34 a.m. three ICE agents detained a father and son, one a U.S. Citizen, “after beating them” near the intersection of West 27th Street and South Harding Avenue.

Happening In The Suburbs

At 8:20 a.m., a person was detained in the 700 block of Hill Drive of suburban Hoffman Estates, according to Elgin Area Rapid Response.

When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials approached Roberts, he identified himself then sped off, abandoned his vehicle, and hid in a brushy area about 200 meters away, where ICE officers located him with help from Iowa State Patrol officers. At the time of arrest, a loaded handgun, hunting knife and $3,000 cash were found in his vehicle. On Oct. 2, he was charged with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms.

Roberts’ rap sheet and immigration history reveal a long record of criminal conduct in the United States. He should never have been serving in a role overseeing children in Iowa’s largest school district.

“Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “When ICE officers arrested this Superintendent, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash. This criminal illegal alien is now in U.S. Marshals custody and facing charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearms. Under Secretary Noem, ICE will continue to arrest the worst of the worst and put the safety of America’s children FIRST.”

His criminal record includes the following:

July 3, 1996: Charges for criminal possession of narcotics with intent to sell, criminal possession of narcotics, criminal possession of a forgery instrument and possession of a forged instrument in New York.

Nov. 13, 1998: A charge for third-degree unauthorized use of a vehicle in Queens, New York, which was dismissed July 6, 1999.

Nov. 1, 2012: A conviction for reckless driving, unsafe operation and speeding in Maryland.

Feb. 3, 2020: Charges for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon (having a loaded firearm outside his home or business); third-degree criminal possession of a weapon (an ammunition feeding device); and fourth-degree weapon charges. A document from Feb. 4, 2020, indicates that the second-degree criminal possession charge was inchoate.

Jan. 20, 2022: Commonwealth of Pennsylvania convicted Roberts of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm.

Sept. 26, 2025: Roberts was arrested with a Glock 9mm pistol and a fixed-blade hunting knife in his possession. He also had $3,000 in cash.

Oct. 2, 2025: Roberts criminally charged with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms.

Roberts’ immigration history includes two visas, four Green Card applications and subsequent denials, and several trips:

June 1, 1994: Roberts entered the United States at John F. Kennedy International Airport on a B-2 nonimmigrant visa; he was classified as a visitor for pleasure. He departed the U.S. on an unknown date but returned before his 1996 arrest for narcotics possession.

It is not clear how many people are being held at the Doremus Avenue site, which sits next to the Essex County Jail near Newark Bay.

Afterward, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to transfer scores of detainees to red states where judges would be more favorable to the Trump administration, immigrant advocates said at the time.
“The treatment of visitors should reflect this importance … No one should have to risk their safety simply to see their loved one.” Both ICE and GEO Group have denied accusations that they mistreat visitors or detainees.","A half-dozen members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation slammed the Trump administration’s inhumane treatment of visitors to Newark’s Delaney Hall in a letter to federal officials — and gave the feds two weeks to detail their plans to fix the troubled immigrant detention center.

The Sept. 30 letter — sent to Kristi Noem of the Department of Homeland Security and David Donahue, CEO of the private prison firm GEO Group, also condemned reports of “poor conditions within the facility itself,” which The Jersey Vindicator recently buttressed in its own reporting.

But the lawmakers mostly focused on the visitors and referenced a September incident in which GEO Group guards forced detainees’ friends and family to stand along a metal fence outside the 1,000-bed, privately run facility during a summer storm that brought torrential rain, booming thunder, and flashes of lightning.

“It is both shocking and deeply irresponsible to line people up against a metal fence during an active lightning storm, a situation that poses obvious and severe risks of electrocution,” the members of Congress wrote.

“Reports have also surfaced of visitors left standing for hours in the heat of the summer sun, exposed to extreme temperatures and health risks,” they wrote. “These conditions are unacceptable and reflect a profound disregard for the dignity, well-being, and basic rights of those who come to visit individuals who have been detained.”

Delaney Hall has been a lightning rod for controversy since the feds opened it this spring to house undocumented people swept up in the Trump administration’s massive immigration raids.

It is not clear how many people are being held at the Doremus Avenue site, which sits next to the Essex County Jail near Newark Bay.

But reports about brutal mistreatment and squalid conditions have surfaced regularly, and riots erupted in June after angry detainees confronted their guards about a lack of food.

Afterward, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided to transfer scores of detainees to red states where judges would be more favorable to the Trump administration, immigrant advocates said at the time.

But it is not just the detainees who are suffering.

People who come to visit have complained about a range of issues, including long waits, poor communication from guards, favoritism toward certain visitors, and retaliation against anyone who speaks to either advocates or the press, civil rights advocates have said.

The lawmakers’ letter — which was signed by Democratic Reps. Donald Norcross, Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, Josh Gottheimer, and Nellie Pou — urged officials to “immediately provide human accommodations for visitors” that include covered waiting areas, consistent visiting hours, and bathroom and parking access.

The letter also said the Department of Homeland Security and the GEO Group, the private company that runs the facility’s day-to-day operations, should revamp its entry process to avoid lengthy delays, improve communication and transparency, and give visitors access to clothes in case of dress code violations.

The legislators set a deadline of Oct. 16 for the agencies to send a written response detailing how they would fix these “unacceptable practices.”

“Visitation plays a vital role in correctional settings by supporting family bonds and sustaining community relationships,” they wrote in their letter. “The treatment of visitors should reflect this importance … No one should have to risk their safety simply to see their loved one.”

Both ICE and GEO Group have denied accusations that they mistreat visitors or detainees.

The plan had been privately relayed to immigrant advocates earlier this week by what they said were sources inside the government.
According to advocates, as soon as unaccompanied immigrant children turned 18, they would be detained by ICE.
Immigrant children in federal government custody are held by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Many unaccompanied immigrant children also lack legal representation, largely due to budget cuts by the Trump administration.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is beginning to target unaccompanied immigrant children, pressuring them to accept cash payment in exchange for agreeing to be deported, according to a government memo to immigrant aid groups obtained by The Intercept.

The operation — which immigration rights advocates said was called “Freaky Friday,” though ICE denied the name — is a part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing mass deportation campaign. With deportation continuing apace amid the federal government shutdown, advocates speculated that the latest scheme to pay off immigrant children was deliberately timed by ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, to minimize public attention.

“The idea that masked men would now go to 14-year-olds and ask them to waive their rights to return to the countries that they fled is shocking.”

The memo said immigrant children 14 years or older would receive $2,500 in exchange for agreeing to be deported.

“The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will provide a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500 U.S. Dollars to unaccompanied alien children, 14 years of age and older, who have elected to voluntarily depart the United States as of the date of this notice and moving forward,” said the memo, which was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that holds children in immigration custody.

Alarmed by word of the new operation, immigrant rights advocates began to widely circulate information about the plan in private email chains earlier this week.

“The idea that immigration enforcement agents can coerce children into waiving their rights and protections under this memo to meet President Trump’s political goals is cruel,” said Bilal Askaryar, director of communications at Acacia Center for Justice, which represents and advocates for unaccompanied immigrant children. “Americans have been shocked by the tactics that ICE is using in communities across the country, and the idea that masked men would now go to 14-year-olds and ask them to waive their rights to return to the countries that they fled is shocking.”

The government memo stipulated that children who elected to take the payment, must arrange to meet with an ICE officer. In order to waive their right to a removal hearing so that they can receive the payment, the child themself would have to sign a form to change their status with the U.S. government.

“If the child agrees to the stipend, DHS will issue a l-210 addendum declaration for the child to sign,” the memo says.

In a statement to The Intercept that was subsequently posted online, an ICE spokesperson confirmed that the agency would begin to target unaccompanied minors for deportation, calling the plan “voluntary.”

The agency said ICE and DHS “are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families” and that financial support would only be provided at the approval of an immigration judge.

ICE told The Intercept the “voluntary option” would initially be offered to 17-year-old unaccompanied children.

The plan had been privately relayed to immigrant advocates earlier this week by what they said were sources inside the government. The advocates had gotten word that ICE was expected to target children aged 14 or older and was considering lowering the range to children as young as 10. For children who decline ICE’s offer, advocates said they had heard from sources that ICE agents would threaten the children as well as their relatives in the U.S. with detention.

The ICE spokesperson said, “Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin.”

According to emails sent by advocates, ICE agents are expected to track down and visit the children who arrived in the U.S. without their parents. Many live in shelters, with relatives, or with host families.

In the plan, according to advocates, agents would first target children who are currently in federal immigration detention, followed by those who have already been released from custody.

According to advocates, as soon as unaccompanied immigrant children turned 18, they would be detained by ICE. Immigrant children in federal government custody are held by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.

By Friday afternoon, immigrant rights organizations and attorneys who were mobilizing against the operation began to receive emails and texts from the government about the deportation plan. Advocates have urged immigrants, especially children, not to sign any documents that attempt to threaten or incentivize children to waive their rights without first seeking legal advice.

In its statement to The Intercept, ICE declined to say whether children would be threatened with detention.

The Trump administration has shown a willingness to lock up unaccompanied children. Over Labor Day weekend, the government targeted 300 Guatemalan children for deportation, with agents hastily rounding up 76 of the children from their caregivers’ homes in the middle of the night and boarding many of them onto planes. A federal judge blocked their deportation hours before takeoff.

Many unaccompanied immigrant children also lack legal representation, largely due to budget cuts by the Trump administration.

In February, the Trump administration began to track the whereabouts of unaccompanied minors in the U.S. with the intent to deport them, according to a Reuters report. Then, in March, the administration cut a federally funded program that provided legal representation for minors in their immigration cases. The program supported more than 26,000 children, according to the University of California, Los Angeles, Latino Policy and Politics Institute.

From 2023 to 2024, the U.S. government received referrals for 93,356 unaccompanied children entering the country, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, according to government data.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2195569259-e1759512751353.jpg?fit=4000%2C2000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-03 17:57:58.033303

It is unclear if those arrested at the South Shore apartment building are included in that number.
People detained no matter their status Tenants said it appears everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including US citizens.
“It was scary, because I had never had a gun in my face,” Pertissue Fisher, who lives in the building, told CNN affiliate WLS.
“Federal law enforcement officers will not stand by and allow criminal activity flourish in our American neighborhoods,” DHS said.","Adults and children alike were pulled from their Chicago apartments, crying and screaming, during a large overnight raid that has left tenants and neighbors shaken.

“I’ve been on military bases for a good portion of my life,” said Darrell Ballard, who lives in the building next door. “And the activity I saw – it was an invasion.”

Ballard recalled seeing residents detained outside the building for hours, after seeing a Black Hawk helicopter flying over the five-story building in the city’s South Shore neighborhood and military-sized vehicles and agents filling the parking lot early Tuesday morning.

All were part of a multiagency operation that led to the arrest of 37 undocumented immigrants, most of them from Venezuela but also including people from Mexico, Nigeria and Colombia, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN.

In the past weeks, federal agents have been deployed on the streets of Chicago and have arrested more than 800 undocumented immigrants since September 8 during what the administration has titled “Operation Midway Blitz,” according to a news release from DHS.

It is unclear if those arrested at the South Shore apartment building are included in that number.

The building was targeted because it was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates,” and two people arrested are believed to be members of the Venezuelan criminal gang, according to DHS. A number of others arrested had criminal histories that included aggravated battery and possession of a controlled substance, the agency said.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker condemned the federal operations in a statement released Friday.

“Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities,” the governor said.

Shattered windows marked the apartment building as seen in photos from the aftermath of the raid. Hallways were lined with debris and plastic bags while clothing, wall decor and lamps became piles of litter inside apartment units. CNN has reached out to the apartment building managers for comment.

People detained no matter their status

Tenants said it appears everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including US citizens.

“It was scary, because I had never had a gun in my face,” Pertissue Fisher, who lives in the building, told CNN affiliate WLS. “They asked my name and my date of birth and asked me, did I have any warrants? And I told them, ‘No, I didn’t.’”

Fisher said she was handcuffed anyway, before being released around 3 a.m. and was told anyone with an outstanding warrant, even if it was unrelated to immigration, would not be released.

At least one US citizen with an active narcotics warrant was arrested during the operation and turned over to the Chicago Police Department, DHS said.

Ballard said the majority of those he saw handcuffed outside were Black residents and “quite a few” were detained for two to three hours.

Four children who are US citizens with undocumented parents were taken into custody, DHS said, including a child who was allegedly found with a Tren de Aragua member.

“For their own safety and to ensure these children were not being trafficked, abused or otherwise exploited, these children were taken into custody until they could be put in the care of a safe guardian or the state,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Across the country, US-born children have become collateral damage in the Trump administration’s unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants. CNN identified more than 100 US citizen children, from newborns to teenagers, who have been left stranded without parents because of immigration actions this year, according to a review of verified crowdfunding campaigns, public records and interviews with families, friends, immigration attorneys and other advocates.

Another neighbor, Eboni Watson, said she and others ducked for cover when hearing several flash bangs go off.

“They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” Watson told WLS, recalling trucks and military-style vans were used to separate adults from their children.

In its statement addressing the raid, DHS noted it was still gathering information about those arrested “due to the size” of the operation and will provide more information.

“Federal law enforcement officers will not stand by and allow criminal activity flourish in our American neighborhoods,” DHS said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-03t113520z-1864893076-rc2u3hazouza-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-03 16:57:46.733887

Chicago Activist on Organizing Community ICE Patrols as Trump Escalates Immigration Crackdown (Democracy Now!)","Hello, Carlos De Loera here. This will be my last edition of the Latinx Files for now, as I will be handing the reins back to Fidel Martinez next week. It’s been fun leading this newsletter for the past couple of months. I’m honored that Fidel trusted me with taking care of his work baby while he took care of his IRL baby.

It’s become a common saying that everyone in the United States is “living in unprecedented times.”

The Times is no stranger to the saying. Neither is the other Times. It’s even been meme-ified, with many people online expressing that they are tired of living through unprecedented times.

Raucous election cycles, a pandemic, an insurrection, a litany of mass shootings, government shutdowns, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, landmark Supreme Court decisions, recall elections and special elections — all occurrences that have marked these unprecedented times in the U.S.

But when looking at these events through the lens of the history of the Americas, they all seem to follow a familiar playbook.

“It’s a movie that we have seen already and it’s so frustrating,” Paula Ávila-Guillén, the executive director of the Women’s Equality Center, told The Times when discussing the chaos taking place in the U.S.

“You just need to look at the history of some countries that maybe you have never thought you would become — and realize that you are becoming them, but when you’re plagued with American exceptionalism it’s really hard [to recognize].”

Ávila-Guillén grew up in Colombia, where she became a lawyer, and passed the bar exam in New York. She previously worked at the Center for Reproductive Rights as an advocacy strategist and is an active member of the Green Wave movement: a feminist movement for the decriminalization of abortion, which originated in Argentina and has spread throughout the world.

She has been a strident observer of authoritarian regimes throughout the Americas and identifies the key pieces of legislation that tip countries toward an autocratic society. Up until recently, she was hesitant to label the actions of the Trump administration as an authoritarian — but one of Trump’s latest presidential memorandums tipped the scales for her.

Issued on Sept. 25, NSPM-7 — titled “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence” — authorizes government-wide investigations into non-profits, activists, their donors and funders by using the vague labels of “terrorism” and “conspiracy against rights,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The directive expressly states that it enables the National Joint Terrorism Task Force to “coordinate and supervise a comprehensive national strategy to investigate, prosecute and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law.”

“This is exactly the same thing that many other authoritarian regimes have done in the past,” Ávila-Guillén said. “By threatening [human rights activists] that anything that we could say could be seen as domestic terrorism is a very specific tactic to dismantle and discredit the work that we do and that was also a tactic that many regimes that have leaned to the right have used in the past.

“There was a time in Colombia and in Peru, and again in Argentina, Chile and Brazil, where being a human rights defender or women’s rights defender was seen as just belonging to the left, and therefore political, and therefore you become a target. And that’s exactly what that missive is doing.”

Reflecting on how such regimes tend to choose their first targets, Ávila-Guillén noted that they always start with what they perceive to be the weakest points of society — and that usually involves targeting women’s rights.

“When women are just simplified by our reproduction, and that’s the only value that we add to society, we are not seen as leaders,” she said. “It’s harder for us to re-initiate some of those changes and revolution of changes. So they always start with with women and with regulating our bodies.”

Naturally, Ávila-Guillén argued, the next target in line would be transgender people as they challenge societal norms and often stand at the intersection of healthcare and bodily autonomy. The Colombian attorney pointed out that the current administration’s continued attention and antagonism toward such a small, minority population would be used, in part, as a distraction from Trump’s other legislation, like last week’s federal budget reallocation.

Ongoing ICE raids, the disappearance of hundreds of ICE detainees, targeting the Latinx community, regulating trans and child-bearing bodies, demonizing autism and deeming fat bodies “a bad look” all make one thing clear to Ávila-Guillén.

“It’s white supremacy. It’s an ideal of what people should look like, and it’s rhetoric that’s also helpful for them when they are literally disappearing immigrants,” she said. “Everybody is going to wake up one day and wonder how it’s possible that we let so many people disappear, how it’s possible that we let so many people be in prison for so long without due process. And it’s because while we were talking about fat people, about trans issues, they were doing [those] deeds, and it’s very hard to pay attention.”

She explained the psychological process of allowing authoritarianism to reign freely. The first part is that people must actively live in denial, because accepting it would involve making an effort to change things. The next part that people are being bombarded with narratives that point the finger at immigrants for all problems — not at “capitalism, corporations or corruption.” The key element of this section of the psychological process is dehumanizing the “other”; the final part is the devaluation of the truth.

She drew parallels between the Trump administration and that of Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, as well as Javier Milei in Argentina.

“They started with the press, by saying it is not legitimate. ‘The truth doesn’t exist anymore. The press is propaganda,’” Ávila-Guillén said. “They start targeting young men to make them believe that the reason they are struggling is because of women’s progress. Milei threatened to eliminate legal abortion in Argentina and Bukele has promised to keep El Salvador’s total abortion ban. Both of them also have started dismantling of programs to protect those who are more vulnerable.”

The good news is that she believes that it’s not too late for people to recognize what is happening and to do something about. Her weapons of choice for combating authoritarianism? Skepticism and the truth.

“The most important step right now is that we get out of our bubbles of information and start relying a lot more on good journalism,” Ávila-Guillén said. “You need to start questioning the things that you thought were not possible, because legally, maybe they are possible. And as you see, there are multiple presidents who have reformed constitutions in every country to stay in power longer... or they have found another way. When the system becomes questionable and legality becomes questionable, there are no [more] hard truths and hard no’s. That’s why it’s so important to to be able to fight back now, while we can still do it.”

But don’t expect politicians to be the ones to quell authoritarianism, Ávila-Guillén advised. Community members are the ones that are more likely to make an immediate impact in helping and protecting their neighbors from the thumb of the government. In her view, it’s the friend from across the street that drives his neighbor across state lines to get an abortion; or the activists that drive ICE agents out of their neighborhood to protect the local street vendors that can make the biggest differences.

“Don’t comply in advance. You wait until you’re forced to it. Recognize that we might be afraid, but also that we are not alone, that we have tons of people who are showing up in multiple events and in multiple forms and understanding in which way you can show up,” she said.

“Maybe you can only share info on social media. Maybe you can support some funds that are collecting money for immigrants or women who are traveling to other places to have abortions. Maybe you can serve virtually as a translator. There is no one, exclusive way to help. But the most important thing is sharing good sources of information, because the priority for us to get out of this system is of us to all start seeing the same level of real, truthful information of what is happening and to not turn a blind eye.”

The memo, reported by The Associated Press news agency and The New York Times on Thursday, comes after the US military last month struck three alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, killing 17 people. Rights observers and war powers scholars have said the attacks appear illegal under US and international law and likened them to extrajudicial killings.

The memo is the clearest picture yet of how the administration is seeking to justify such attacks and what its approach could portend.

“Although friendly foreign nations have made significant efforts to combat these organizations, suffering significant losses of life, these groups are now transnational and conduct ongoing attacks throughout the Western Hemisphere as organized cartels,” the memo said, as reported by the AP.

“Therefore, the President determined these cartels are non-state armed groups, designated them as terrorist organizations, and determined that their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States,” it added.

The argument is an extension of the Trump administration’s reframing of cartels as “narco-terrorists” who seek to destabilise the US by pushing illegal drugs across its borders and not profit-driven criminal entities.

The memo did not specify the groups in question although the Trump administration has labelled several Latin American cartels “foreign terrorist organizations” and has particularly focused on Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.

Under the US Constitution, only Congress has the right to authorise the use of military force or declare war; however, presidents may take unilateral actions in some cases, particularly in matters of the country’s immediate self-defence.

There is currently no authorisation of use of military force from Congress (AUMF) that would even remotely apply to the strikes in the Caribbean.

Because of that, members of Congress have come under increased pressure to assert the legislative branch’s war powers authorities to rein in Trump. Still, several members of Trump’s Republican Party, which holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate, have cheered the attacks.

Other lawmakers have warned of allowing Trump’s actions to go unchecked.

In a post on X after Thursday’s reports on Trump’s memo, Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: “Every American should be alarmed that Pres Trump has decided he can wage secret wars against anyone he labels an enemy.”

“Drug cartels must be stopped, but declaring war & ordering lethal military force without Congress or public knowledge – nor legal justification – is unacceptable,” he wrote.

On Bluesky, Brian Finucane, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group and former US Department of State lawyer, said there was “so much wrong” with the Trump administration’s legal justification for the strikes in the Caribbean.

He pointed to the claim that Trump had “determined” that drug smuggling constituted an “armed attack” on the US, which appears to underpin the administration’s stance that the strikes did not stray into unconstitutional war.

“‘Baloney’ is the technical legal term for that claim,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68dedc0a-1759435786.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-03 16:56:55.393744

“Mario and his family are being punished for his reporting,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a post on BlueSky.
Over the course of his career in the United States, he won numerous awards, including an Emmy, and was named one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia.
Guevara came to the U.S. on a B1 visa, is authorized to work in the United States, and has a social security number.

On Tuesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied an emergency request to temporarily block the Board of Immigration Appeals’ order to deport Guevara. The three judges on the immigration appeals board were all appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi under President Donald Trump.

“Mario and his family are being punished for his reporting,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a post on BlueSky. “This cruelty is meant to stifle our free press.”

“Words cannot begin to describe the loss and devastation my family feels,” said Mario’s son, Oscar, in a statement released on Thursday. “I am in utter shock and disbelief the government has punished my father for simply doing his life’s work of journalism.”

“He is the reason our home feels like home,” he continued.

Oscar said after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, “it was my dad who centered me, who drove me to my medical appointments, and who lifted me up.”

In 2004, Guevara came to the United States from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. He settled in Georgia and continued his work as a reporter. Over the course of his career in the United States, he won numerous awards, including an Emmy, and was named one of the 50 Most Influential Latinos in Georgia. In 2019, his reporting was the subject of a New York Times documentary, and in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MGNews.

In June, officers arrested him while he was reporting at a “No Kings” protest against Trump, even though he was wearing a vest with “PRESS” written on the front and back. Guevara was taken to the local jail and then placed in ICE custody. All charges were dropped, but the government fought to deport him, arguing that he was a danger to the community based on his livestreams and videos of law enforcement activities.

“I was following them,” Guevara told the Altanta-Journal Constitution in a phone interview published in July. “I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.”

He said that during his detention, officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

Over the course of his more than 100 days of imprisonment, he has been subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, confined to his cell for 22 hours a day, according to the ACLU.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously told Truthout in an email that Guevara was in custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004, which is false. Guevara came to the U.S. on a B1 visa, is authorized to work in the United States, and has a social security number. He is also eligible for a green card.

Local lawmakers, human rights groups, and press freedom organizations condemned Guevara’s detention and called for his immediate release. On Tuesday, more than a hundred scholars, journalists, and writers sent a letter to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to demand his release. Signatories included Art Spiegelman, Arundhati Roy, David Remnick, Ibram X. Kendi, Jelani Cobb, John Cusack, Judith Butler, Judy Blume, and Julianne Moore.

In response to the news that Guevara would be deported on Friday, Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said in a statement that Guevara was “ripped from his family and community because the Trump administration punishes journalists to protect its own power.”

“The only thing that journalists like Guevara threaten is the government’s chokehold on information it doesn’t want the public to know,” he continued.

Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director Paul O’Brien said in a statement that deporting Guevara “sends a chilling and dangerous message: that journalists can be detained, silenced, and deported simply for doing their jobs.”

“The already cruel immigration system is being used as a testing ground for widespread authoritarian practices under Trump, and now, with the deportation of Mario Guevara, it is being weaponized to silence a journalist,” he continued.

Last month, Guevara penned an essay about his imprisonment.

“I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote.

“Hopefully, soon all my tears and my family’s tears will be wiped away, and we can have fun and smile, triumphant, as we did before, together and in absolute freedom.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/cropped-2025-10-3-Mario-With-Family-1-scaled-e1759514522880.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 17:58:02.876975

So far in Dallas, the community has turned out for Marouf.","When I saw Marwan Marouf’s face plastered on my Instagram feed, under bright red letters announcing he’d been arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the first thing I remembered was his distinctive, gentle voice.

For nearly three decades, Brother Marwan, as we know him, has been a constant presence in our community. Long before the Dallas area attracted thousands of Muslims and high-profile religious leaders, we grew up in small congregations, and people like Marouf led prayers and delivered short sermons to a few-dozen families now and then. He’d arrived in the city in the ’90s as a student, and he later worked as an engineer at the same company as my dad and some of my friends’ parents.

Once, in high school, during late evening Ramadan prayers, I fell asleep while he was giving a lecture, lulled into a sense of peaceful drowsiness. In the women’s section of the mosque, there was a running joke that the mics weren’t strong enough to amplify Marouf’s soft-spoken delivery. I remember being annoyed that I had missed most of his sermon, as he’d been coming around to our masjid less frequently, since there were dozens of them now to rotate between. His sermons were almost always uplifting reminders about how to live more compassionately and generously at a time when it felt like both these forces were dwindling in our society.

Marouf, who is Palestinian, had been seeking permanent legal status since 2012 after receiving student and work visas, according to his lawyers in a press release, but he was first denied a green card in 2020. On September 22, ICE informed him he was denied again, his lawyers say, based on a decades-old claim that Marouf—through his support for the Palestinian-led charity the Holy Land Foundation—had supported terrorist activities. ICE arrested him that day, and he’s since been detained at the notorious Bluebonnet detention facility some 200 miles away from home. The Muslim Legal Fund for America (MLFA), which is handling his case, declined to comment for this story as he awaits a bond hearing, but the group has said that Marouf’s arrest and detention are “a direct affront to the due process protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.”

In North Texas, where I grew up, Marouf is best known in the community for his work with the Muslim American Society of Dallas, supporting youth programming. He sponsored a Boy Scouts troop, led volunteer initiatives, and worked with programs for refugees as well. During the pandemic, he drove around Dallas and its sprawling suburbs delivering meals and supplies to people who needed extra help. Last year, he was recognized by the City of Richardson, one of the inner-ring suburbs, for his community service.

On social media, the Muslim American Society quickly started collecting stories in his support, with the hashtag #BecauseOfMarwan. Many people affectionately called him Amo, the Arabic word for uncle, recalling his humble nature and the small ways he would make people smile—never getting mad at kids running amok at the center; making volunteers feel proud of the tasks they were assigned; and constantly working in the background to make everything run smoothly. He never sought the spotlight, but everyone who’s been in town long enough knows the name Marwan Marouf.

“When I moved to Dallas with my family, Amo Marwan and his family really helped us feel like we’d lived here our whole lives,” said Noor Wadi, a community organizer who’s been supporting public outreach efforts for his case. “When … we’re at civic events, it feels empty without Amo Marwan. But we have hope that he will come back home. We’re going to apply pressure from every single angle.”

The Holy Land Foundation case, which the government tenuously tied Marouf to, was a major milestone in the U.S. government’s targeting of Muslims and Palestinians. The W. Bush administration designated the foundation a terrorist organization in 2001, saying that it had secretly sent funds to Hamas. The charity, which had provided food and medical aid and supported other aid programs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, was at that point the largest Muslim-led charity in the United States. It distributed funds to reputable organizations in Palestine that also received funds from the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the European Commission.

In what many observers, including the ACLU and Human Rights Watch, consider a sham trial, the five leaders of the charity were convicted and sent to prison. Their sentences ranged from 15 to 65 years. The convictions relied on testimony from anonymous witnesses from the Israeli military and evidence gathered from government wiretaps of the charity’s leaders. Former Treasury Department officials later admitted that Muslim-run charities were an “easy, soft target” in the early years of the War on Terror.

According to Marouf’s legal team, he was transparent about his time volunteering with the foundation, when they had fundraisers locally, when immigration officials questioned him about it during his green card application process. And his donations and volunteer work pre-dated the Bush administration’s questionable terror designation anyway.

“This volunteer work included ordering pizza and hiring a clown to entertain children while their parents attended [foundation] fundraising events,” MLFA said. “Marwan’s donations included sponsorship of an orphan in Palestine. And yet, some thirty years later, the government still chooses to wrongfully penalize Marwan for these ordinary acts of charity—acts which he considers obligatory to his faith.”

Wadi said that the case could raise fears among the community about being targeted for similar donations or civic engagement. The accusations made 20 years ago against the Holy Land Foundation, and other Islamic charities, are similar to the accusations that Israel has recently leveled against the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, for example. In 2024, the Biden administration froze funding to the humanitarian organization after Israel accused some of its staff of participating in terrorist acts.

What’s different now, Wadi said, is that the general public isn’t blindly accepting such claims about Muslims in their communities, especially after watching what a United Nations commission and a growing number of scholars have declared a genocide in Gaza, along with the blatant targeting of Palestinian student activists like Mahmoud Khalil. “People from all walks of life are saying, ‘That’s enough.’”

Imam Omar Suleiman, a well-known Dallas preacher, said that Marouf’s arrest was particularly shocking as the Trump administration has targeted Palestinians involved in demonstrations. “His arrest makes it apparent that the administration is now interested in targeting any Palestinian immigrant, whether they voice their opinions or simply serve quietly within their communities,” Suleiman said in an email.

So far in Dallas, the community has turned out for Marouf. At a packed community gathering the day after his arrest, Suleiman told the gathered crowd not to despair. “This is not a funeral, this is not us bidding farewell to someone,” he said. “The heart of our community, the pillar of our community, has been taken away from us, and we can’t rest, nor can we accept that this is the way this is going to go.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:16.090620

Cases about presidential firing powers and tariffs are already on the docket, and other cases about immigration and spending powers are speeding their way to the court.

Those join what was already shaping up to be a monumental term for the justices, with three cases that could determine the scope of transgender rights and a voting rights dispute that could see the court deliver a final word on whether the Constitution is color-blind or demands special consideration for historically oppressed minorities.

The justices have been dealing with Trump executive actions over the last nine months in preliminary rulings, and the president has done exceptionally well on what’s known as the emergency docket.

But now the cases will be firmly before the court, fully briefed and argued, and ready for rulings that will shape the contours of the American presidency for decades to come.

“This is the Trump term,” said Josh Blackman, professor at South Texas College of Law. “So many of the Trump cases that came to the Court on the emergency docket will now need to be resolved on the merits docket.”

The first major test comes on Nov. 5, when the court takes up a case challenging Mr. Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs.

The president says he’s acting with authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows him to impose customs and duties. He says that includes tariffs, but lower courts have questioned that, saying the word “tariff” doesn’t appear anywhere in the law.

A president’s power to fire at will is also on the line in a pair of cases.

One, scheduled for oral arguments in January, will test whether Mr. Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board for cause was valid. The other could overturn a 90-year-old precedent and grant Mr. Trump wide-ranging latitude to fire members of independent agencies for disagreeing with his policies.

The justices have already ruled in emergency docket cases, allowing him to carry out firings of members at the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal Trade Commission. But those were interim rulings that froze things in place while the cases developed in lower courts.

Now the justices have agreed to hear the FTC firing case in full.

In a 1935 case known as Humphrey’s Executor, the court ruled that then-President Franklin Roosevelt broke the law by firing an FTC member over policy differences.

Mr. Trump has also asked the justices to overturn a court decision blocking his attempt to limit birthright citizenship for babies born to illegal immigrants. And a series of immigration arrest and deportation cases and federal spending cases are also winding their way to the justices’ docket.

“It is fair to say that litigation over the administration’s executive orders is going to be a major part of this term,” said Daniel Sullivan, a partner at Holwell Shuster & Goldberg LLP and a former clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

Carolyn Shapiro, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, said the justices will firm up the rest of the term’s calendar in several months, which will show just how Trump-centric the term will be.

“We don’t know what all of those cases will look like,” said Ms. Shapiro. “Usually, I would think by December — maybe the very beginning of January — is usually when they are done granting cases that will be argued during the term.”

Transgender and voting rights

The court’s 2025-2026 term kicks off Monday with lower-profile oral arguments for a case involving defendants’ ability to discuss their case with their lawyers and another involving judicial rules for dismissing complaints.

The first transgender case begins Tuesday: A Christian licensed counselor is challenging Colorado’s rules forbidding “conversion therapy” for transgender minors, saying it violates her free speech rights.

Next week the court will hear the voting rights case, which grew out of Louisiana’s attempt to draw congressional maps. Its first map after the 2020 census only included one majority-Black district out of six.

Prodded by Black voters, a federal court ruled that was too skimpy, given the state’s population, which is 34% Black. The court said that violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which courts have cited to prod states to maximize Black voting power.

Louisiana redrew its lines to create two majority-Black districts, which is the current map. Non-Black voters in the state then challenged the map, saying the Legislature was too focused on race.

The case came to the high court last term, but the justices delayed a ruling and ordered a rehearing this term — and specifically ordered all sides to file briefs on whether focusing so heavily on minority voting power violates the 14th or 15th Amendments to the Constitution.

Depending on how the case plays out, it could directly challenge a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, known as Section 2. That part pushes states to maximize minorities’ voting power as a way of making up for past oppression.

Justice Clarence Thomas, the court’s senior jurist and one of its two Black members, said it’s impossible to square the favored treatment of minority voters required by the Voting Rights Act with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

When the court announced it would rehear the case, he urged his colleagues to settle the matter — and side with the Constitution.

“I am hopeful that this court will soon realize that the conflict its Section 2 jurisprudence has sown with the Constitution is too severe to ignore,” Justice Thomas wrote.

The justices have another election-related case in a challenge to campaign finance limits.

Current law limits how much political committees can directly coordinate with candidates’ campaigns for office. The National Republican Senatorial Committee says that’s a violation of the First Amendment.

The court has a death penalty case on its docket in which it will weigh the factors that judges can consider in deciding when a convict’s IQ is so low that carrying out an execution would violate the Constitution’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

In addition to the conversion therapy case, the high court will review Idaho and West Virginia laws barring transgender athletes from competing outside of their biological sex.

Lower courts have blocked the laws, arguing they discriminate against transgender athletes, violating the Equal Protection Clause.

Roughly two dozen states have laws restricting transgender athletes’ participation in girls’ sports.

Decisions in the cases are expected by the end of June, when the justices wrap up their in-person work for the 2025-2026 term.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/25/Supreme_Court_33848_c0-0-3847-2244_s1200x700.jpg?4e3334b5f60e1a620fe178ccc810e951e7302e23,N,,2025-10-03 16:57:54.725443

We are witnessing the build out of a national paramilitary policing force that could be used to intimidate people and consolidate President Donald Trump’s power.

This week alone, the administration placed 200 Oregon National Guard under federal control and deployed them to Portland, following the president’s false and bizarre claim that the city is “war ravaged” and his threat to authorize “full force, if necessary.” Oregon’s governor, as well as the city of Portland, immediately objected and have since sued. The president also told a large assembly of senior military officials that he intends to deploy troops to Chicago and said that troops should use American cities as “training grounds” for the military.

Already in Chicago, masked federal law enforcement agents armed with rifles roam the city’s tourist districts and the southside. Federal agents have arrested people who recorded their actions. Ten miles west of Chicago, camouflage-clad and masked federal agents—some reportedly positioned like snipers from the rooftop of the building—fired tear gas and pepper balls against a crowd of 100 protestors and journalists outside of the Broadview ICE facility. Federal agents are conducting immigration raids in Chicago and its suburbs with aggressive shows of force, including helicopters, flash bang grenades, and dozens of trucks and agents. And federal law enforcement is arresting people for alleged immigration violations without warrants, including U.S. citizens.

The governors of California, Oregon and Illinois have objected to federalized troop deployments in their states, but other governors are volunteering their troops in support of the administration’s agenda. In Missouri, the governor authorized the state’s National Guard to provide logistics support for immigration enforcement, while Louisiana’s governor has requested federal assistance to activate up to 1,000 of the state’s National Guard on general “public safety” grounds.

National Policing Force Poses Civil Liberties Threat

Deploying military troops and masked federal agents is part of something larger that is happening under our noses. The Trump administration is trying to build out a sprawling national military and police force—intended to be accountable to the president, not the people. The administration is intentionally blurring the lines of law and accountability that limit federal law enforcement, the military, and state and local police to their proper roles. It is cycling through false justifications and purported mandates to do so—invoking crime, homelessness, immigration, and now even “domestic terrorism.”

In Florida last week, the state’s National Guard joined federal, state, and local law enforcement agents in a massive, multi-day immigration arrest operation—its legal authority and constraints are unclear. In Washington, D.C., ICE is reportedly joining local police on patrol, even after the expiration of a 30-day emergency declared by the president.

The legal and ethical constraints that govern each of the law enforcement agencies involved, as well as the military, are critically important and we can’t let them be blurred or cast aside.

The Trump administration is going after the most vulnerable people in our communities, targeting immigrants, Black and brown people, as well as anyone who protests these cruel actions. But we know it does not stop here. A national policing force can be wielded against anyone who doesn’t pass the president’s loyalty test.

A Movement to Protect Our Communities

The administration’s overreach is spurring new opposition and concern across the ideological spectrum.

A judge appointed by Ronald Reagan recently said in a decision on the free speech rights of non-citizens: “Can you imagine a masked marine? It is a matter of honor—and honors still matters. To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history, we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.”

Videos of reckless federal personnel pushing people to the ground, and assaulting journalists and protestors, have sparked outrage. California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a suite of bills under the banner of fighting “secret police” tactics—a step we believe will further embolden governors and legislatures across the country in the coming months to build a firewall of freedom. Already, more than half of states have passed Firewall measures to push back on Trump’s attempts to violate our rights.

As the threats continue to grow, we need even more concrete protections. States and cities should move to limit or withdraw from partnerships with the Trump administration that are being used to terrify and attack our neighbors and loved ones, like ICE’s expanding 287(g) program Governors and legislatures should enact measures to ensure that no state employee volunteers state and local resources, including data and equipment, to federal personnel who would use it to violate our rights.

Our schools, healthcare facilities, libraries, and shelters should establish protocols to limit law enforcement access without a warrant so that they are safer for our community members to visit. Our state and local governments should invest in proven public safety strategies and reject the administration’s attempt to redeploy the military as a police force in America’s streets

Remember: We Are Stronger Together

While much of the formal power to stop these deployments lies in the hands of local, state, and federal officials, we are not powerless—and it’s imperative that we keep speaking out. The Trump administration is relying on people being too scared to resist its cruel and unlawful measures. But the deployments in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Portland, and Memphis have shown us that we are stronger together. Whether it’s going to a No Kings protest, filming ICE activity, taking a Know Your Rights training, or simply helping your neighbors’ children get safely to school, we can all help protect not just our loved ones, but our communities.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/10/no-national-guard-in-dc-sign-s.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:42.189167

This is not because they’re dumb (they’re not) or incompetent (as the top Democrats of the Senate and House and as representatives of New York, both have risen to positions that require a Lyndon Baines Johnson-esque dexterity most of us couldn’t sustain for a single PTA meeting).

You can see it playing out in the government shutdown. Schumer and Jeffries seem almost neurologically incapable of operating in the world Trump has created — one where politics is less about governing or even persuasion, and more about staying on offense and generating spectacle.

Schumer exudes old-fashioned backroom politics and insider deal-making, which is another way of saying that he’s scripted, sweaty and stilted. It’s not that he’s bad at speaking; it’s that the kind of speaking he has mastered — the methodical, over-enunciated style that once charmed donors and editorial boards — is the equivalent of trying to fax something in 2025.

Jeffries, by contrast, is calm and disciplined. He speaks slowly, often channeling a rhythmic pattern that is reminiscent of a preacher or litigator. In a different era — the kind of era when “normal politics” still existed — this trait might have worked brilliantly. Today, it just feels tired. He’s supposed to be the hip one, once marketed as a “bad, brilliant brother from Brooklyn.” But his recent attempts at communication feel more like a corporate onboarding seminar.

And it’s not like he’s compensating for this shortcoming by electrifying the progressive base. Jeffries’ recent praise for New York Mayor Eric Adams (calling him a man who “served courageously and authentically for decades”) was a bit like praising Nickelback for artistic innovation. It’s not just inaccurate; it’s weirdly tone deaf to the moment.

To be fair, competing with Trump’s megaphone requires a skill set that is closer to professional wrestling than to 20th century politics. Trump is chaotic and often incoherent to the point of parody. But, and this is key, he never sounds like a normal politician.

In a game where authenticity — however poorly defined and cynically constructed — is the only real currency, the Democrats’ undynamic duo come across as high-functioning androids.

Countering Trump’s superpower calls for Democrats who can compete in the attention economy: leaders who feel authentic, actually enjoy picking constant political fights and understand that “going viral” is the new “getting quoted in the New York Times.”

Indeed, the only Democrats who have shown any capacity for being able to survive in this era have been Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Schumer and Jeffries do not have these skills, despite having plenty of material to work with.

Case in point: Republicans are about to make healthcare more expensive for millions of Americans. In theory, that’s a devastating talking point. In practice, it’s difficult to imagine Schumer and Jeffries delivering it in a way that can compete with Trump’s bogus assertion that the Democrats are shutting down the government because they want free healthcare for illegal immigrants and “transgender for everybody,” whatever that means.

Faced with these mistruths and the anemic response we’re getting from Schumer and Jeffries, the best-case scenario may be that Republicans — by virtue of being the “anti-government” party — take some blame for a government shutdown. But that’s not a strategy. That’s hoping partisan inertia is still on your side.

Regardless, the shutdown is merely the latest example of Democrats struggling to compete with MAGA. The larger problem is that the Democratic Party doesn’t really have a communicator right now. It hasn’t had one since Barack Obama left the stage.

It’s probably not fair to compare a congressional leader with a presidential candidate. But even by the standards of modern congressional leaders, Schumer and Jeffries are ill-equipped for the task at hand.

Democrats need someone with Newt Gingrich’s manic energy, revolutionary zeal and theatrical flair, coupled with Nancy Pelosi’s more pragmatic toughness and ruthless discipline. This is to say, someone who understands that politics is now a form of entertainment, but who still has the moral seriousness to prevent it from devolving totally into nihilism.

The groups are asking Congress to push the administration to restore the funding to protect thousands of trafficking survivors across the US.
The plea for help comes after a Guardian investigation found the administration has rolled back efforts across the federal government to combat human trafficking.
“Allowing these funds to disappear would enable human trafficking and put survivors’ lives at risk,” the letter says.
“Many regions will lose their only service provider, leaving survivors with no safe emergency housing, case management, or counseling.","Anti-trafficking groups across the US have sent Congress a letter raising alarms about the Trump administration’s failure to release $88m in funding to protect survivors of human trafficking.

The letter from 74 legal, religious and advocacy groups says that the US Department of Justice has frozen funding for more than 100 service organizations across the country that help victims “escape their traffickers” and gain access to “the services and support that they need to survive”.

The groups are asking Congress to push the administration to restore the funding to protect thousands of trafficking survivors across the US. The plea for help comes after a Guardian investigation found the administration has rolled back efforts across the federal government to combat human trafficking. Trump officials deny the federal government has made any retreat on anti-trafficking.

An array of local, state and national groups signed the letter, including Freedom Network USA, the Human Trafficking Legal Center, the Minnesota Alliance on Crime and the National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.

“Allowing these funds to disappear would enable human trafficking and put survivors’ lives at risk,” the letter says. “Many regions will lose their only service provider, leaving survivors with no safe emergency housing, case management, or counseling. Communities will be made less safe as traffickers would exploit with impunity, and fewer survivors will be able to come forward.”

Many service organizations saw their federal funding end as of the last day of September, according to Freedom Network USA, a national coalition of service providers, researchers and trafficking survivors.

In response to a query from the Guardian last month about the frozen funding, the justice department said money appropriated by Congress would be spent eventually, but that organizations that received money in the past wouldn’t necessarily do so in the future. Future appropriations, the department said, would be made in accordance with Trump administration priorities.

The letter from the anti-trafficking groups notes: “Congress has overwhelmingly voted to continue these programs over the last 25 years … Protecting and fully funding these lifesaving programs is critical to protecting survivors and preventing re-exploitation.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9aff0e6f7a948da23a57f041e82684cbfe3e25c/468_0_4680_3744/master/4680.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e79309a7fbaaf5320d58250f32d42998",N,,2025-10-03 13:57:26.197025

In her order granting class certification, Thompson agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that a nationwide class is appropriate because the case raises a common question and injury.","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — A federal judge approved class certification Thursday for more than 60,000 immigrants from Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras with temporary protected status who claim that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s recent orders ending the program were unlawful and motivated by racial animus.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson certified three separate classes that include individuals from Honduras, Nepal or Nicaragua who have been granted TPS and who have not been granted lawful permanent residence.

“Thousands of Nepali nationals in the United States risk losing rights, losing income, losing connections with loved ones, and losing freedom in this country because of the secretary’s decision. The same is true for thousands of Hondurans and thousands of Nicaraguans,” the Joe Biden appointee said in her order.

The TPS program protects individuals from certain countries due to violence or economic duress. While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship.

National TPS Alliance and individual TPS holders from Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras sued the Trump administration on July 7, claiming Noem’s actions terminating protections for the three countries violated the Administrative Procedure Act and were motivated by racial animus.

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras until Nov. 18. However, a federal appeals court stayed that ruling, greenlighting the Trump administration to go ahead with its termination of TPS status for the three countries while litigation plays out.

Thompson tentatively approved class certification on Sept. 16, but declined to specify the size of the class or who would be included.

In her order granting class certification, Thompson agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument that a nationwide class is appropriate because the case raises a common question and injury.

“Examination of whether the secretary exceeded her authority by terminating the TPS designations for Nepal, Nicaragua, and Honduras will generate a classwide resolution because deprivation of the protections provided by TPS effect 'all of the class members or … none of them,’” she said.

In crafting the class definitions, Thompson settled some of the government’s concerns by ruling that foreign nationals who are no longer in the United States or are otherwise ineligible for TPS, such as those with a criminal record, were excluded from the class.

“Those foreign nationals who resided outside of the United States during the duration of their country’s TPS designation would not have been a TPS holder and are definitionally excluded from the classes,” she said. “The eligibility requirements for TPS sufficiently limit the scope of the proposed classes to mitigate defendants’ concerns.”

However, Thompson said that individuals who would have otherwise qualified for protected status but didn’t register in time would be included.

“Because late registrants may still ultimately receive the benefits of TPS, even those foreign nationals who fail to timely register for TPS retain a legal interest in the continued TPS designation of their country,” she said.

In a statement to Courthouse News, Lauren Wilfong, an attorney for the plaintiffs from the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said that they were pleased with the court’s ruling.

“We are pleased the court recognized that all TPS holders from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua are suffering devastating harms as a result of the Trump administration's unlawful terminations, and that their claims all revolve around a common claim that the Trump administration failed to follow basic rules for reasoned agency decisionmaking when ending lawful status for these long-term residents,” Wilfong said.

A representative for the defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Oct. 2, the Trump administration filed a motion to stay the case during the government shutdown.

But so far, enforcement against undocumented people on dairy farms had been sporadic and far from the Midwest.
While last Thursday’s raid in Manitowoc didn’t take place on a dairy farm, most of the individuals arrested were dairy workers.
Beyond that, they were dairy workers in the county with the highest concentration of dairy factory farms in the state.
I think that immigrant workers are essential to Wisconsin dairy, and that when they are threatened, farmers in our rural communities are threatened too.”","The morning of Sept. 25, federal agents and immigration authorities swept into Manitowoc to arrest people alleged to be in the country without proper documentation. Agents first went to a Walmart parking lot where dairy workers are known to meet up before driving to the farms where they work. The action then moved on to private residences, where migrants were arrested as they left the house.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims the ICE raid in Manitowoc was aimed at dismantling an international sex and drug trafficking ring, but has so far provided little evidence to support that claim. Federal authorities initially said 21 migrants had been arrested in the raid, before later saying 24 had been picked up.

On Tuesday, DHS released the names of six of the 24. Only one individual named in the release has been charged with a sex crime — Jose Hilario Moreno Portillo, who was charged in Manitowoc County court in May with the 2nd degree sexual assault of a child. However, Moreno Portillo has not yet been convicted and court records show he’s been in ICE custody since July.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on why Moreno Portillo was named as being arrested in the Manitowoc action when he was already in ICE custody.

The five other named individuals have been convicted of identity theft, hit-and-run, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence, possession of narcotic equipment, traffic offenses and a failure to appear charge.

In Wisconsin, immigrants without documentation aren’t able to obtain driver’s licenses, which often causes them to wrack up several criminal traffic offenses when they’re pulled over and ticketed for driving without a license.

With little proof that ICE actually broke up a ring of sex traffickers, immigration advocates and farm groups see the raid as a direct threat to the state’s dairy farms and the immigrant workers that keep the industry afloat.

Farmers and immigrant advocates in Wisconsin have been watching ICE’s actions on dairy farms across the country closely. In March, ICE raided a dairy farm and petting zoo in New York. In April, a raid on a dairy farm in Vermont resulted in eight arrests. And in early June, ICE arrested 11 immigrants in a raid on a dairy farm in New Mexico.

But so far, enforcement against undocumented people on dairy farms had been sporadic and far from the Midwest. In June, President Donald Trump announced and then retreated from guidance that ICE would not aggressively target farms and the hospitality industry.

While last Thursday’s raid in Manitowoc didn’t take place on a dairy farm, most of the individuals arrested were dairy workers. Beyond that, they were dairy workers in the county with the highest concentration of dairy factory farms in the state. Manitowoc County and its northeast Wisconsin neighbors are the epicenter of the modern farming powerhouse that maintains Wisconsin’s status as “America’s Dairyland.”

“It’s just sending an economic ripple effect across the dairy industry, which is Wisconsin’s rural economy,” says Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera. “And then also there’s the symbolic and political dimension to it as well. We are America’s Dairyland, and so this enforcement is not just an administrative matter, but it threatens the industry’s well being. Who are we going to be after all of this? Are we still going to be America’s Dairyland?”

Velasquez says the raid sent a “big anxiety wave” through immigrant communities across the state.

“These views have just spiraled out of control in terms of the rumors that have been sent out across the community, rumors of ICE coming into their neighborhoods, to their homes, to their schools,” Velasquez says.

“I have had serious conversations since the raid in Manitowoc of folks who are planning to leave after many years of being here,” he adds. “They just don’t feel like this is a humane lifestyle anymore. They’ve given many years of their lives, and many of them have children here.”

Michael Slattery, a Manitowoc County farmer who grows grain and raises Holstein steers, points to data that shows 70% of the labor on Wisconsin’s dairy farms comes from immigrants and estimates that the dairy industry is the driver of 20% of Manitowoc County’s economy.

Slattery says farmers can’t survive without that migrant labor because no one else is willing to do the work.

“Do you want to get up at 3 a.m. seven days a week to go out in the cold, the heat, to get kicked by cows when you’re putting the suction cups on, to be shat upon, pissed on, pushed around by 1,400 pound cows? People don’t want that,” he says. “I’ve tried to hire part time labor here, I cannot get people, they don’t want to do this sort of stuff.”

Simply expecting farm families to pick up the slack isn’t the answer, he adds. “These dairy farms, they don’t have enough family members that can come out and replace immigrant labor, both documented and undocumented, that are leaving,” Slattery says. “They’re in a money-losing situation now.”

Losing the dairy labor force would have ripple effects across the economy in Wisconsin and the country.

“What do they do in that situation? If your cows cannot be milked, in two, two and a half weeks they’ll go dry,” he says. “The cows get milk fever, get ill, that’s your cheap hamburger in the stores. They’re selling the cows at a loss, that’s what they’ll do. There’s less milk in the market, that will drive up prices for cheese, milk and butter.”

Danielle Endvick, executive director of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, says if Wisconsin’s immigrant workers leave the state — either from being arrested by ICE or leaving on their own to avoid arrest — farms could close and prices could increase.

“Immigration raids and mass deportations can shrink rural economies, are terribly destabilizing for communities and can harm schools, churches, just the fabric of our rural communities too,” Endvick says. “Our rural spaces, our farmers can’t thrive if we’re treating a key workforce like they’re disposable. I think that immigrant workers are essential to Wisconsin dairy, and that when they are threatened, farmers in our rural communities are threatened too.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0124-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:33.579648

The administration has fired thousands of federal employees this year through the Department of Government Efficiency.","The Trump administration’s plan for mass federal layoffs will test the bounds of executive power in court.

In the hours leading up to the government shutdown, a group of unions filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing its threats to distribute reduction-in-force notices during the shutdown violate federal law.

The question at the heart of the case will be whether a government shutdown provides a legal justification for the White House’s threat to fire federal employees. As a fight plays out on Capitol Hill about which party is responsible for a shutdown, the union’s complaint sets up a high-stakes legal battle that could have massive implications for the federal bureaucracy.

“Any [reduction in force] that does take place will be one that we know we can win in a court of law,” a senior White House official told NOTUS of the impending notices, adding, “We’re no stranger to lawsuits.”

The White House budget director, Russell Vought, “knows these laws better than anyone,” the official said, specifying that anything they do will be “well above the law, in our legal opinion.”

Rushab Sanghvi, general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions in the suit, told NOTUS that “there’s no basis” for the White House’s directive.

Previous shutdown guidance from the White House claims that “furloughs during a shutdown are what you need to do, not RIFs,” said Sanghvi. “So it’s contradictory to their own previous statements.” (The unions’ complaint states that the White House did not address why the position changed.)

Asked if the intention behind the RIFs went beyond simple cost saving matters, a senior White House official did not directly answer. But the official acknowledged the unions’ arguments that RIFs had never been done before in a shutdown.

“I guess we are setting precedent, by nature of doing them,” the official said.

Democrats dispute the idea that a shutdown changes the legality of mass federal firings.

“A shutdown does not give the president any additional ability to fire people or to do what he is doing today,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told NOTUS.

“He’s just taking this unprecedented action to hurt people,” Murray added, “to try and intimidate all of us who are fighting to make sure average citizens don’t see their health care increases by over half they cannot afford it.”

As for how Democratic lawmakers can push back on the firings, Murray said she will be following the unions’ case. (Members of Congress have limited standing in cases against the executive branch.)

Republicans in Congress have defended the firings as necessary because of dwindling federal resources during a shutdown — and if the government opened the RIFs would stop.

“It could end today, if the Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing for the American people,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Thursday. “But if they don’t, and if they keep the government closed, it’s going to get more and more people because the resources run out, and more and more things have to be reduced and eliminated.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Trump had never needed a shutdown to fire people before. The administration has fired thousands of federal employees this year through the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Guess what?” Jeffries said. “They’ve been firing federal employees all along.”",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/d6b904b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7476x4205+0+389/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F4f%2Ff217e32f41069832c30aab9a4ad9%2Fap25272798347261.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 13:57:39.673564

The administration delivered the notification after a mid-September strike on an alleged drug boat hailing from Venezuela.
After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.
Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.

The administration delivered the notification after a mid-September strike on an alleged drug boat hailing from Venezuela. It was the second of three publicly disclosed U.S. attacks on boats in the southern Caribbean Sea last month.

The notice calls the three individuals killed by the Sept. 15 strike ""unlawful combatants,"" which is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.

Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.

The New York Times first reported on the notification to Congress.

A White House official said the information was part of a report to Congress required by the National Defense Authorization Act after the U.S. military conducts an attack. The specific notification concerned the strike on Sept. 15 against an alleged cartel boat. The report ""does not convey new information,"" the official said.

The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In the notification to Congress after the Sept. 15 strike, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an ""armed attack"" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels.

""Although this strike was limited in scope, U.S. forces remain postured to carry out military operations as necessary to prevent further deaths or injury to American citizens by eliminating the threat posed by these designated terrorist organizations,"" the notice read.

This notification uses language like ""armed conflict"" not seen in a previous letter to Congress from the White House that justified the Sept. 2 strike. That notice, which was signed by President Trump and obtained by CBS News last month, was submitted to Congress under a separate requirement.

Asked about the notice, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: ""As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans.""

Brian Finucane, a former attorney-adviser at the State Department who advised the U.S. government on counterterrorism and the use of military force, said the explanation given to Congress is not enough to justify the administration's actions.

""This justification put out here that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict does not do the trick because it's not supported by the facts,"" Finucune said in an interview. ""There has been no armed attack on the United States.""

Some members of Congress have also questioned the legal justification for the three boat strikes. The administration has said little about who was in each boat or what drugs were on board. Mr. Trump has alleged the first two boats — including the one hit on Sept. 15 — hailed from Venezuela, but didn't specify a country of origin for the third strike.

The initial strike on Sept. 2, killed 11 people, according to a post on President Trump's Truth Social, which didn't include details about what drugs were on board.

When asked what legal authority the Pentagon used to justify the strike, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters traveling with him to Fort Benning, Georgia, ""We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that,"" without citing any specific legal justification.

""If foreign terrorist organizations are poisoning people with drugs from drug cartels, it is no different from Al Qaeda, and they'll be treated as such."" Hegseth said.

Since then, the U.S. military has struck two more alleged drug boats, one on Sept. 15, killing three people, and another on Sept. 19, killing another three, and has threatened further strikes.

After the initial strike, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky had an online dispute with Vice President J.D. Vance about the actions — and the lack of information from the administration.

""I'm just disappointed that, you know, the leaders of a country like ours that is famous for having due process for trying to make sure that the innocent aren't harmed in any way would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The strikes come amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of collaborating with gangs — a charge Maduro's regime denies.

Maduro said earlier this week he is considering declaring a state of emergency in response to U.S. ""aggression,"" following the boat strikes and a deployment of several U.S. Navy vessels off the waters of Venezuela.

Separately in March, the White House invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua, accusing its members of engaging in ""irregular warfare"" against the U.S. ""both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela."" The administration has controversially tried to use the law as a rationale to rapidly deport accused Tren de Aragua members, in some cases sending them to a Salvadoran prison.

Nothing in the Republican Beautiful-for-Billionaires Law changes these policies, meaning repeal of the law’s more than $1 trillion in health care cuts makes no changes to this prohibition for undocumented immigrants.
Whitehouse’s office remains open to help Rhode Islanders navigate the Republican government shutdown.","Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today slammed Vice President JD Vance’s social posts, which egregiously misrepresent Democrats’ push to end the Republican government shutdown and to fix the chaos and destruction Republicans have unleashed on the American health care system:

“The lawless Trump administration is using every trick in their propaganda playbook to distract from the fact that health insurance premiums for Rhode Island families are about to more than double, unless there is bipartisan action from Congress. The Vice President knows very well that people who are not in this country legally have NEVER been eligible for federally funded Medicaid, Medicare, or Affordable Care Act tax credits.

“This is a Trump shutdown manufactured to continue Republicans’ strange fetish for taking away Americans’ health care. While Republicans control the presidency and both chambers of Congress, Democrats will use every lever of power we have to end the Republican health care crisis and end their shutdown.”

On Tuesday night, before the government shut down, Whitehouse explained that Republicans were repeating baseless lies about Democrats shutting down the government to give health care to undocumented immigrants. Vance responded to the Senator on X with a bizarre post erroneously showing a state-funded health care policy in New York. After Whitehouse pointed out the Vice President’s mischaracterization of a state-funded policy, not federal at all, Vance issued another statement this morning trying to clean up his misleading post by saying that “money is fungible.”

Undocumented immigrants are prohibited from buying Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace coverage and receiving ACA tax credits. Undocumented immigrants also cannot receive federally funded Medicaid and Medicare coverage. Nothing in the Republican Beautiful-for-Billionaires Law changes these policies, meaning repeal of the law’s more than $1 trillion in health care cuts makes no changes to this prohibition for undocumented immigrants.

In July, President Trump and Congressional Republicans jammed through their Big, Beautiful-for-Billionaires bill, which cuts almost a trillion dollars from Medicaid, triggers a half-trillion in Medicare cuts, and raises health insurance costs, all to bankroll tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. Without bipartisan action to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits, health insurance premiums are set to more than double on average next year.

The new law also included a hidden cut to Medicare from adding $4.1 trillion to the national debt, automatically triggering the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act, which will impose $536 billion in automatic cuts to Medicare over the next decade.

Did the feds trick her?,"Melissa Gomez, www.latimes.com, melissa-gomez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-03/film-director-brazil-detained-by-ice-green-card-interview,"As of Thursday, she had been moved to Arizona and will return to California while her deportation proceedings remain open, her attorney said.
According to her attorney, Marcelo Gondim, Marques May arrived in the U.S. in 2018 on a tourist visa.
She ended up overstaying her visa, he said, and in 2019, the government sent her a notice to appear for a court hearing to begin deportation proceedings.
In April 2025, the couple got married and she began the process to apply for a green card, Gondim said.
Until a judge rules on the case, Gondim said, ICE cannot deport her.","On Sept. 16, Barbara Gomes Marques May and her husband arrived at the downtown Los Angeles federal immigration building for what they believed would be the final step in Marques May’s process to obtain her green card.

The interview process had gone smoothly, Tucker May recalled. But toward the end, a federal immigration official she had met with said he needed Marques May to follow him so he could photocopy her passport, he recalled. She and her husband believed the trip would be brief and they would be able to leave.

Instead, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent arrested Marques May, a 38-year-old Brazilian national who has no criminal record and works as a film director in Los Angeles. She was handcuffed and transferred to the ICE facility in Adelanto in San Bernardino County before being sent to Louisiana. Meanwhile, her husband and her lawyer scrambled to try to stop her deportation.

On Wednesday, Marques May was scheduled to board a 6 a.m. flight to her home country, but her attorney was able to file a motion to reopen her deportation proceedings and keep her on U.S. soil, at least temporarily. As of Thursday, she had been moved to Arizona and will return to California while her deportation proceedings remain open, her attorney said.

“It’s very much an ongoing nightmare,” Tucker May said in an interview this week.

Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond to a request for comment about Marques May’s case.

According to her attorney, Marcelo Gondim, Marques May arrived in the U.S. in 2018 on a tourist visa. Gondim said she applied for an extension but was denied. She ended up overstaying her visa, he said, and in 2019, the government sent her a notice to appear for a court hearing to begin deportation proceedings.

But Marques May had moved and had not kept her address up to date with immigration court, and so the letter never reached her, Gondim said. Because she failed to appear, the government issued a removal order against her.

In April 2025, the couple got married and she began the process to apply for a green card, Gondim said. Under the Biden administration, he said, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would have notified Marques May that there was a removal order issued for her and directed her on how to get it resolved.

Overstaying a visa is not considered a criminal offense, and penalties are issued if the person leaves the country. In cases involving married couples, Gondim said, there’s an automatic forgiveness for overstaying a visa, relief that Marques May would’ve been eligible for.

But the Trump administration has instead used courthouses and Citizenship and Immigration Services offices to engage in mass arrests of migrants attending mandated hearings and appointments. Soon, the USCIS will have expanded powers.

In September, the Department of Homeland Security issued a new directive that will allow the agency — which administers and oversees immigration applications — to enforce immigration law with “special agents.” The order goes into effect Monday.

“USCIS will have greater capacity to support DHS efforts by handling investigations from start to finish, instead of referring certain cases to Homeland Security Investigation within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” the agency said in a statement.

After Marques May was arrested, May struggled to figure out where federal authorities had sent his wife. Finally, he was able to get in touch with her, and she detailed how, when she was arrested in L.A., she burst into tears, and an ICE agent took a selfie with her, he said.

During her transfer between detention facilities, she told him, she was subjected to harsh conditions, including how she went without food or water for more than 12 hours and had access to bathrooms with no toilet paper. She was given only bread and water and a couple of times an apple.

Marques May, who had surgery this year for chronic back problems, was also denied medical treatment for a device she uses to manage her pain, he said. May went public with her arrest more than a week after she was detained, he said, because he had run out of all legal avenues.

“There is an open disdain being shown by ICE for the basic rule of law for this country,” he said.

May began posting about her arrest online, garnering hundreds of responses and support. A GoFundMe page had raised more than $50,000 as of Thursday. U.S. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), who counts Marques May as one of her constituents, said she was “doing everything possible to prevent her deportation and I’m demanding that ICE follow the law.”

“Unfortunately, Barbara’s case is not unique, it reflects a broader pattern under Trump’s immigration policies that are unlawful and cruel,” she posted on X.

Gondim said he repeatedly tried to stop her from being transferred to facilities outside California, only to find barriers and delays by ICE officials to getting legal documents for her to sign. From Adelanto, she was transferred to Arizona, then Louisiana.

The government is not doing anything wrong by complying with the removal order, he said, “but they cannot prevent the person from having access to counsel and be able to present their case to file some form of relief [so they] don’t get unjustly deported.”

To stop Marques May’s imminent deportation, Gondim filed separate motions to reopen her deportation proceedings and terminate her deportation proceedings. Until a judge rules on the case, Gondim said, ICE cannot deport her. He said he’s hopeful that she will end up being released.

“Since she has already an approved petition from her U.S. citizen husband, and she has a clear path to filing a new [application] and getting her green card,” he said, an immigration court judge will not be interested in pursuing a case against a person who should be approved for permanent residency by law.

Until then, May said his wife’s first feature film has been put on hold until she can be released. In 2021, Marques May premiered her short film, “Pretas,” at the Culver Theater for the L.A. Brazilian Film Festival. The film centers on Black women and their experiences dealing with racism and carries a message of creating a more anti-racist society.

“I love Los Angeles so much,” she said in an interview at the time. “I couldn’t be happier. It was a premiere I wasn’t expecting.”

It was their shared love of films that bonded the couple, who met on a dating app, May said. They spent a lot of their time together watching movies, sharing popcorn and then discussing what worked and didn’t in the films.

May says he now thinks about all the immigrants who have not committed any crimes but lack the legal resources to avoid deportation.

“These are human beings that these terrible things are happening to,” he said. “If anybody reads stories like this, if they think this doesn’t apply to them because they’re not married to an immigrant, I beg those people to consider what they think comes next.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9acb9b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/960x504+0+145/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F1a%2Fc769d2b042f9b8b1d8376fd3f579%2Fcrop-95095053-1759018927547645-r.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:57:33.063689

Experts say its dangerous,Josh Marcus,,,,,https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/ice-trump-dhs-surveillance-penlink-b2838451.html,"The move, which comes after immigration agencies scaled back the use of such data under the Biden administration, has alarmed privacy advocates.
“Every American should be concerned that Trump's hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant.” The Independent has contacted ICE and PenLink for comment.
One of the products, Tangles, “automatically ingests historical data from multiple communication channels, mobile forensics, internet-based communications, location data, financial records and web intelligence,” according to procurement records obtained by Forbes.
That same year, CBP said it would stop using commercially sourced smartphone location data, and ICE did the same by early 2024.
“This seems to be part of a much larger pattern of ICE trying to collect anything and everything it can,” he said.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is reportedly seeking to buy access to a powerful suite of highly controversial surveillance tools that will allow the agency to monitor people’s locations based on data from hundreds of millions of mobile phones.

The move, which comes after immigration agencies scaled back the use of such data under the Biden administration, has alarmed privacy advocates.

Don Bell, policy counsel at the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, warned that the surveillance tools could let ICE get around the privacy protections of the warrant process and the Fourth Amendment.

“This is probably unconstitutional,” Bell told The Independent. “Usually, if law enforcement wants to take your phone, and is interested in getting your location data, they would need a warrant, but because the law has not kept up with technology, there is this loophole that effectively has allowed law enforcement to purchase location data, which is highly sensitive, without getting a warrant first.”

In a redacted acquisition document obtained by the tech news site 404 Media, the immigration agency proposes entering into a contract to buy “all-in-one” tools from a company called PenLink that will allow agents to “compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices.” The document also mentions payments for services involving “face detection,” “advanced face search,” and a “dark web data feed.”

“The Biden Administration shut down DHS’s location data purchases after an inspector general found that DHS had broken the law,” Senator Ron Wyden told the outlet. “Every American should be concerned that Trump's hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant.”

The Independent has contacted ICE and PenLink for comment.

One of the products, Tangles, “automatically ingests historical data from multiple communication channels, mobile forensics, internet-based communications, location data, financial records and web intelligence,” according to procurement records obtained by Forbes.

The company that originally created Tangles, Cobwebs, was founded by a former member of Israel’s elite cyber intelligence agencies, and it was reportedly kicked off Meta in 2021 after allegedly being found using Facebook and WhatsApp accounts to snoop on activists and opposition politicians in Hong Kong and Mexico. The company later merged with PenLink in 2023.

The ICE documents also describe the agency testing out a tool called Venntel, whose creators the Federal Trade Commission in 2024 accused of “unlawfully tracking and selling” sensitive location data, including information about mobile users’ visits to health-related locations and places of worship.

ICE’s reported purchase of these high-powered tools reverses the trend from the Biden administration, when law enforcement's purchasing of mass amounts of consumer data for surveillance came under heavy scrutiny.

A 2023 report from the Department of Homeland Security inspector general found that ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and DHS failed to follow internal privacy guidelines and federal law in their use of such location data.

That same year, CBP said it would stop using commercially sourced smartphone location data, and ICE did the same by early 2024. By April of that year, the House of Representatives passed the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would ban the government from buying Americans’ data from data brokers it they would otherwise need a warrant to obtain it.

That momentum has reversed under the second Trump administration, which has pushed to obtain vast new surveillance powers as part of its overall mass deportation campaign and infusion of unprecedented funding into federal immigration enforcement.

The Trump administration has reportedly restarted a $2 million contract with Paragon Solutions (US) Inc., a spyware company founded in Israel whose products have been accused of facilitating the surveillance of journalists and activists. The deal had previously been frozen to review whether it complied with a March 2023 Biden administration executive order limiting the use of commercial spyware that could pose counterintelligence risks to the U.S. or that might be improperly used by a foreign government, WIRED reported.

Paragon’s “zero-click” Graphite program can quietly invade the mobile phone of its target and extract its contents, even from encrypted apps.

Under Trump, ICE has also struck agreements with fellow government agencies to access highly sensitive data, including from the Internal Revenue Service and Medicaid.

Bell, the Constitution Project attorney, warned that the combination of recent leaps in computer and AI power, ICE’s mass expansion of surveillance and data access, and the Trump administration’s willingness to brand ideological opponents and protesters as domestic terror threats could pave the way to arbitrary and concerning action from federal agents.

“This seems to be part of a much larger pattern of ICE trying to collect anything and everything it can,” he said. “Even if that means scooping up information on Americans, which is different from their purported goal, and it is made all the more concerning and dangerous because it seems like this administration is also redefining what it means to be in opposition.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/30/3/07/GettyImages-2237820258.jpg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-03 15:57:38.188546

That issue is as factbound as it gets,” the cruise lines wrote in court filings.","The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a pair of cases involving Exxon and major cruise lines that could ease the ability of U.S. companies to seek compensation for property confiscated by the Castro regime in Cuba.

Congress created a pathway for such lawsuits nearly three decades ago but allowed presidents to suspend it. Each president did so until President Trump enabled cases to commence during his first term.

Now in his second term, the justices asked for the Trump’s administration’s input on whether they should take up two of the cases that had reached the high court. Trump’s Justice Department urged the court to do so, and it wants the justices to ultimately rule it should be easier for the lawsuits to proceed.

“This is the most important case involving U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba to reach this Court in the past sixty years,” one of the companies seeking compensation wrote in its Supreme Court petition.

The cases are set to be heard during the court’s upcoming term, with decisions expected by next summer.

In the first, Exxon is suing Cuban state-owned companies. In the other, the company that built and operated the piers at Havana’s port is seeking to reinstate a $440 million award it won against some of the world’s biggest cruise lines.

The cases present distinct legal questions, but both concern the scope of the Helms-Burton Act, which Congress passed in 1996 to strengthen the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Its passage was spurred by the Cuban Air Force shooting down two unarmed civilian planes.

The law includes a provision enabling U.S. nationals to file lawsuits against anyone who “traffics” in property confiscated by the Cuban government after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.

Exxon sued CIMEX and UnionCuba Petroleo, both Cuban state-owned enterprises, over the Castro regime’s confiscation of an oil refinery and more than 100 service stations owned by a subsidiary of Exxon, which was then known as Standard Oil. A U.S. commission later certified the company’s losses totaled roughly $71.6 million.

Exxon pleaded with the justices to review a lower court holding that its lawsuit can only proceed if it also meets an exception under a separate federal law that grants foreign sovereigns broad legal immunity in U.S. courts. Exxon argues the specific pathway laid out in the Helms-Burton Act supersedes those general rules.

“That erroneous holding impedes private suits against Cuban agencies and instrumentalities and stymies important foreign-policy interests in holding the Cuban government accountable for continuing to benefit from its illegal expropriations,” the Justice Department wrote in support of Exxon’s petition.

The state-owned companies urged the justices to turn away the appeal, writing that “the Court has repeatedly warned of the fallacies and perils of this approach to statutory interpretation.”

The Supreme Court will hear the case alongside a lawsuit against some of the world’s biggest cruise lines.

Havana Docks Corporation, which built and possessed 99-year rights to operate the piers at the Port of Havana, is seeking compensation after the Castro regime took over the port upon assuming power.

The company is suing Carnival, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean for disembarking nearly 1 million tourists on the docks between 2015 and 2019 and taking in hundreds of millions of dollars from those trips — paying Cuba but not Havana Docks.

A lower court ordered the cruise lines to pay Havana Docks $440 million. The Supreme Court will review an appeals panel’s decision to reverse the judgment since the company’s 99-year rights to the docks expired in 2004, before the voyages in question took place.

Havana Docks warned that would cut off legal claims Congress intended to allow, but the cruise lines said the petition was “full of overstatements” and the case didn’t merit the justices’ attention.

“The decision below correctly resolved a narrow issue that turns on the particular metes and bounds of a century-old property interest governed by the vagaries of Cuban law. That issue is as factbound as it gets,” the cruise lines wrote in court filings.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/ZoomIn-SCOTUS_062025_AP_RodLamkeyJr.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-03 12:57:37.348559

Earlier this year, members of the University of Virginia School of Law’s International Human Rights Law Clinic traveled to Costa Rica to attend a hearing at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on a matter that could ripple across international law.

The case, Chirinos Salamanca and Others v. Venezuela, concerned the state’s responsibility for alleged human rights violations of 12 police officers, who were incarcerated and tortured in the infamous Helicoide prison in Caracas.

The hearing, however, was not about whether there were human rights violations but rather who the court recognized as the legitimate government of Venezuela, which could determine if the international court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

That issue arose because of the existence of two competing governments: the de facto government led by President Nicolás Maduro and an interim government appointed by the National Assembly.

The Venezuelan government argued that the alleged human rights violations occurred during the gap between Maduro’s withdrawal of the country from the American Convention on Human Rights and the 2019 re-ratification of the treaty by the National Assembly government, then led by Juan Guaidó, which claimed power that year.

As a result, in Chirinos, the court had to address the question of whether it could recognize a de facto government when a rival constitutional government simultaneously claimed authority over the same state.

Recognizing the importance of the case for international human rights law and public international law, I and fellow clinic members Luci Harris ’25 and Elijah Brown ’26, along with Professor Camilo Sánchez, the clinic’s director, submitted an amicus curiae brief to the court.

The brief reviewed state practice and scholarly literature on how international law deals with competing governments, highlighting that while there is no single binding rule, customary international law provides a framework of principles (such as constitutional legitimacy, effective control and democratic legitimacy) that courts can apply to determine which government may bind the state in treaty matters.

The clinic urged the court to embrace this framework and emphasized that international tribunals are not powerless in these situations: They have both the authority and responsibility to decide questions of governmental identity when necessary to uphold human rights obligations.

In late August, the court issued its decision on the question of jurisdiction. In a unanimous decision, it held that the convention remained binding on Venezuela. The court cited the clinic’s brief in a footnote, and its reasoning reflected many of the same arguments. By emphasizing principles like state continuity and effet utile (the idea that treaties must be read in a way that preserves their effectiveness), the brief helped ground the court’s conclusion that Venezuela’s human rights obligations remained intact despite Maduro’s attempted withdrawal from the treaty.

This marked a significant victory for the clinic’s client and carries resounding implications for international human rights law. The decision serves as guidance to other international courts adjudicating human rights issues when authoritarian governments seek to withdraw from treaties to avoid accountability, such as the Taliban’s withdrawal of Afghanistan from the International Criminal Court.

The clinic’s work strengthened the court’s reasoning and gave added legitimacy to a decision that breaks new ground in international law.",https://www.law.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/images/2340_human_rights_clinic_costa_rica_main.jpg?h=16e2d142&itok=qXz_st2k,N,,2025-10-03 13:57:29.622137

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Government shutdown projected to have a light impact on border and migration enforcement: Congress failed to pass a budget by September 30, triggering the first U.S. government shutdown since 2019. While all federal employees face delayed pay, nearly all DHS personnel—including over 93% of CBP and ICE staff—are deemed essential and are required to continue working. Military personnel deployed to the border will also continue operations, though National Guard members in particular risk hardship in a prolonged shutdown. Immigration courts may be forced to postpone cases if the shutdown drags on.

Abuses continue to accompany “mass deportation” operations: The Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago has led to more than 800 arrests, highly visible federal deployments, violent response to protests at an ICE facility in Broadview, and a late-night raid that traumatized residents of an apartment complex. Similar incidents in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Washington, DC show a pattern of increasingly aggressive enforcement. Detention numbers remain near record highs, with growing shares of non-criminal migrants held in poor or secretive conditions. Civil liberties concerns are mounting over warrantless arrests, data-mining surveillance tools, and the Supreme Court’s green light for racial profiling.

Notes from Mexico: About 1,200 mostly Cuban migrants left Tapachula, Chiapas on October 1 in a caravan bound not for the United States but for Mexico City. Meanwhile, Mexico’s former migration chief issued a court-ordered apology for the 2023 Ciudad Juárez detention fire that killed 40, which victims’ families condemned as inadequate. At the border, officials continue to block asylum processing as Border Patrol sought to debunk smugglers’ online disinformation.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Government shutdown projected to have a light impact on border and migration enforcement

The U.S. government’s 2025 fiscal year ended on September 30, and Congress was unable to agree on an appropriations bill to keep the government running. Until that changes, the federal government is “shut down” for the first time since 2019. Government employees are working without pay, although those deemed “essential” are required to report to work. Federal employees receive back pay after shutdowns conclude; however, a prolonged shutdown can cause financial hardship for those without significant savings.

Approximately 95 percent of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees, or nearly 258,000 workers, are expected to continue working as the government shuts down, as the Department’s contingency plan designates them as essential. That includes over 93 percent of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees, whose agencies are flush with cash from the giant “big beautiful bill” appropriation that Congress passed in early July.

At the U.S.-Mexico border, Border Patrol agents and CBP officers will continue working during the shutdown. Border Patrol agents will also remain in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, where the Trump administration sent agents “due to violence outside ICE facilities” late last week, the Washington Examiner reported.

The Defense Department, listing the U.S.-Mexico border as one of its top priorities, announced that military personnel deployed there will not be furloughed during the government shutdown. Active-duty troops and reservists will continue their border activities, with pay halted after October 15, according to the Washington Examiner. That may be a major hardship for many National Guard personnel, who typically serve part-time and are already pulled away from their civilian jobs. The Examiner, citing the Defense Department, noted that “a total of 8,500 military personnel assigned to the Joint Task Force Southern Border remain on duty.”

Elsewhere in the immigration system, a prolonged shutdown could force the immigration court system (Executive Office for Immigration Review, within the Department of Justice) to reschedule “tens of thousands of cases,” according to the American Immigration Council.

Abuses continue to accompany “mass deportation” operations

Chicago

The Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration crackdown, launched on September 8 in Chicago, continues at an intense pace. Arrests now exceed 800, according to DHS. Border Patrol agents and other federal law enforcement personnel, their faces often covered, were highly visible in the city’s downtown and tourist areas over the weekend of September 27-28. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) called them “jackbooted thugs roaming around a peaceful downtown.”

The administration announced that it is deploying 100 National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Those likely include an ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, which has been the site of regular protests and escalatory official responses. Local officials, including the mayor and police chief, have voiced alarm at the violent nature of agents’ response to protesters, particularly their liberal use of tear gas and chemical agents, and have opened three criminal investigations.

Incidents under local investigation include two hit-and-run vehicle strikes of pedestrians, and what appears to be the totally unprovoked firing of a pepper ball at a CBS News Chicago reporter inside her vehicle on September 28. “People were peacefully standing behind the fence and for absolutely no reason, pepper balls were fired” on September 26, a pastor on the scene at Broadview told Reuters.

“The relentless deployment of tear gas, pepper spray, and mace at the ICE facility is endangering nearby village residents, harming police officers, harming firefighters, and American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights,” said Mayor Katrina Thompson. “I was offended,” said Police Chief Thomas Mills, citing ICE agents verbally abusing his officers. “I’ve worked with a lot of federal agencies on criminal investigations, that has never happened. We may not have always seen eye to eye, but we’ve always been able to work it out for the good of the community.”

“This is not Putin’s Russia,” Mayor Thompson added. “This is America.”

Nearly 300 ICE, Border Patrol, and other federal agents conducted a late-night raid on September 30, replete with military weapons and tactics, in an apartment building on Chicago’s South Shore, leading to the arrest of 37 people accused of drug trafficking, weapons crimes, and immigration violations. Residents and neighbors described it as a “traumatic event” as agents in camouflage uniforms and carrying heavy weapons pulled nearly every one of the building’s occupants from their apartments regardless of their age or state of undress, leaving many of the apartments badly ransacked, the local ABC affiliate and Chicago public radio reported. DHS claimed that the apartment’s neighborhood was “a location known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates,” referring to the Venezuelan criminal organization, but provided no evidence to back up that assertion.

Eboni Watson, a neighbor, told ABC of hearing several flash-bang grenades. “‘They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,’ Watson said. ‘That’s all I kept asking. What is the morality? Where’s the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘f them kids.’’”

As dozens of onlookers watched and recorded, Border Patrol agents detained a family of asylum seekers from Guatemala while the children, aged eight and three, were playing in a fountain in Chicago’s lakefront Millennium Park on the afternoon of Sunday, September 28. Authorities sought to detain the family under a July 8 order to deny bond even to documented asylum seekers if they had entered U.S. territory without inspection. A federal judge ordered the release of the mother and kids on October 1, but the father is now detained in Texas. “There were a lot more people there [at the park], but the agents came directly to us because of how we look,” the mother told the Chicago Tribune. “It’s not fair.”

The Washington Post spoke to “four experts with decades of experience in criminal justice” who reviewed footage of the September 12 incident during which an ICE agent shot and killed a 38-year-old Mexican father, Silverio VIllegas-González, in the Chicago suburb of Franklin Park. They had strong criticisms of the way the agents chose to confront Villegas-González and their subsequent use of force.

“We don’t stop in front of the vehicle for routine stops,” said a senior Northern California police official. “That’s just an officer safety issue.” Another criticized agents’ decision to reach into a vehicle that might start moving and observed that shooting at the vehicle, as an agent did, is not “a reliable way of actually stopping that vehicle.” By hitting the driver, the agent “just created an uncontrolled, unguided missile.”

Other cities

In New York City, an ICE agent returned to duty on September 29, just three days after being caught on video grabbing a distraught Ecuadorian woman who was clinging to her detained husband, then roughly throwing her to the floor of a corridor at the 26 Federal Plaza building that houses Manhattan’s immigration court. ICE had announced on September 26 that the unnamed agent was “being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” but he has been reinstated. The status of any investigation is unclear.

Four days later, citizen video caught ICE agents violently throwing two photojournalists to the ground in the Federal Plaza hallway. One had to be hospitalized. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) wrote on Twitter: “Masked ICE agents shoved and injured journalists today at Federal Plaza. One reporter left on a stretcher. This abuse of law-abiding immigrants and the reporters telling their stories must end. What the hell are we doing here?”

In Van Nuys, California, a 79-year-old car wash owner has filed a $50 million federal claim alleging he was body-slammed and detained by masked ICE and Border Patrol agents during a September 9 raid at his business. Rafie Allah Shouhed suffered multiple broken ribs, elbow injuries, and a traumatic brain injury, according to the claim, despite his attempts to show proof of his employees’ work authorization. The claim asserts that agents responded, “You don’t f— with ICE. We are here.”

In Chelsea, Massachusetts, Reuters reported, ICE dragged a Guatemalan permanent resident out of her car while she was accompanying a relative to an immigration court hearing, then threw her to the ground. “Reuters captured images of the woman on the ground, her hands pinned behind her back, being detained by federal agents while her son stood nearby crying.”

The New York Times looked at how Washington, DC has become “a testing ground for ICE,” as the agency arrested about 1,200 people between early August and mid-September, up from 85 between January 20 and the end of July. It largely did so by targeting immigrants during minor traffic stops alongside the city’s police force and the U.S. Park Police.

Profiling

Several Washington-based immigrant rights defense groups and Washington, DC citizens filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court seeking to stop practices like these, which they say rely on racial profiling. “In some instances, the racial profiling is blatant and explicit,” the suit reads, recounting several cases of agents holding citizens and legal residents for hours or more based on their appearance. Among examples is that of plaintiff José Escobar Molina:

Agents immediately handcuffed Mr. Escobar Molina, grabbed him by the arms and legs, and called him “illegal” repeatedly. When he responded that he has “papers” (in other words, immigration status), they replied, “No you don’t. You are illegal.” After the agents put Mr. Escobar Molina into a vehicle, when Mr. Escobar Molina told them again that he had “papers,” the driver of the car yelled at him, “Shut up, b—-! You’re illegal.”

At a Slate podcast, legal analysts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern recalled the September 8 Supreme Court ruling allowing immigration enforcement personnel to target individuals based solely on their apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment while lower-court challenges proceed (see WOLA’s September 12 Border Update). In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh had stated that resulting stops of U.S. citizens would be “typically brief.” As cases of prolonged and abusive stops of citizens and residents accumulate, commentators are commonly referring to them with the ironic term “Kavanaugh stops.”

The New York Times identified at least 15 cases since January of U.S. citizens arrested or detained in immigration sweeps. They are usually Latino men mistakenly detained and questioned. Despite declaring their citizenship, many have been ignored, handcuffed, and held in immigration facilities without access to a lawyer or phone call. “You’ve got no rights here. You’re illegal, brother,” a Florida state trooper, recorded on mobile phone video, said to 18-year-old U.S. citizen Kenny Laynez-Ambrosio. Leonardo Garcia Venegas, who was born in Florida, was stopped twice in less than two months.

Gregory Bovino, the chief of Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector who is now a “commander-at-large” and the face of operations in Los Angeles and Chicago, faced criticism for comments he made to WBEZ public radio reporter Chip Mitchell. Shortly after agents chased a man, Mitchell asked Bovino why agents thought the man was undocumented. Bovino replied, “There’s many different factors that go into something like that. It would be agent experience, intelligence that indicates there’s illegal alienage in a particular place or location. Then obviously the particular characteristics of an individual, how they look. How do they look compared to, say, you?” Mitchell is a middle-aged White man. “How do they appear in relation to what you or other people look like?”

Gov. Pritzker accused Bovino’s forces of “harassing people for not being white.” Bovino said that Mitchell took his comments out of context, calling them “grossly inaccurate,” but WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times produced the recording and transcript.

Bovino was at the center of another news story, from his time heading the mass-deportation operation in Los Angeles over the summer. The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California in Sacramento, career prosecutor Michele Beckwith, told the New York Times that she was fired for insisting that Border Patrol agents obey an injunction (not applicable to Los Angeles) prohibiting agents from carrying out indiscriminate raids in central California.

Her firing occurred shortly after she issued that warning to Bovino. The Times reported that on July 15, “she emailed Mr. Bovino to reiterate she expected ‘compliance with court orders and the Constitution.’ Hours later, her work cellphone went dark. Then her computer did, too. She checked her personal email account,” where she got a message—six hours after sending a message to Bovino—informing her of her immediate firing from the Department of Justice after 15 years of service.

Bovino shared with the Times a statement: “The former Acting US Attorney’s email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.” (In fact, federal judges in two cases this year have found the behavior of agents under Bovino’s command to be at odds with the Constitution.) The Los Angeles Times noted, “Two days later on July 17, Bovino and his agents moved into Sacramento, conducting a raid at a Home Depot south of downtown.”

Detention

The latest numbers from ICE, released on September 25 and current as of September 21, show a population of 59,762 in the agency’s network of detention facilities, a number that may exclude many currently held at some state governments’ new detention sites. The overall population number remains slightly down from the 61,226 detained people noted in ICE’s August 29 report, which was likely a record.

Of the 46,015 in detention on September 21 who ICE had arrested in the U.S. interior, 36 percent had no criminal record, up from 6 percent at the end of the Biden administration. That category exceeded the other two reported statuses (34% “convicted criminal” and 30% “pending charges”). This is the first time that migrants with no criminal record have been the largest category during the Trump administration, according to immigration data analyst Austin Kocher.

The Guardian reported on deplorable conditions at a new, hastily opened, and not fully licensed detention center, run by the ICE contractor CoreCivic, in California City, California. Detained people cited a lack of access to hygiene supplies, inadequate food and medications, chronically backed-up toilets and sinks, and mistreatment by staff, including threats of solitary confinement. “This place is built to break us,” said a detained person from Cambodia. “There is nothing but harassment and torture here. It’s inhumane, unsanitary, and a health hazard every single day… Please, please help us, please.”

A Huffington Post investigation by Matt Shuham highlighted the Trump administration’s expansion of a network of state-run immigration detention centers, with the massive facility that Florida opened in the Everglades as a prototype. These detention sites are operating under murky legal authority, routinely restrict detained people’s access to legal counsel, and have notoriously harsh conditions, while those held there often fail to turn up in ICE’s locator database and are effectively missing. Reports include lack of medical care, sanitation failures, exposure to extreme elements as punishment, and hunger strikes. Similar facilities are popping up in Texas, Nebraska, Louisiana, and Indiana.

“Would the world know if someone died in Alligator Alcatraz?” Shuham asked, using the name that Florida’s government uses to refer to its Everglades facility. “After at least one medical emergency last month, when a man collapsed at the site, attorneys and activists aren’t so sure.” Two of those interviewed called the Florida facility a “black site.”

ICE is transferring many in detention to other facilities across the country, despite available space at nearby sites, the Los Angeles Times reported. The practice degrades detained people’s access to legal representation and medical care. Some are being moved multiple times within a short period. “Transfers have been used as a retaliatory tactic for those who make requests, file complaints, or stage protests such as hunger strikes,” noted reporter Gabrielle Lamarr Lemee. Between January and July, 12 percent of those in the detention system had been moved at least four times, up from 6 percent during the same period in 2024.

Miguel Ángel García, who was shot by a sniper while being held in a vehicle outside a Dallas ICE facility, died of his wounds on September 30. He is the second fatal victim of the September 24 incident. Brought to the United States from Mexico as a child, García was 31, and his wife is expecting their fifth child. Juan Proaño of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) told the Washington Post that while he lay unconscious for the previous several days, “García’s wife was allowed twice daily visits for two hours while a Department of Homeland Security officer guarded her husband’s hospital bed, and that officers kept soft restraints on his arms and shackled him.”

Cybersecurity and DHS data mining

ICE has purchased access to surveillance tools from contractor Penlink, known as Tangles and Webloc, which track the locations of hundreds of millions of mobile phones every day, including data from social media, according to 404 Media. The outlet has broken several stories about ICE data technology purchases that raise concerns about privacy and civil liberties. “The Biden Administration shut down DHS’s location data purchases after an inspector general found that DHS had broken the law. Every American should be concerned that Trump’s hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant,” read a statement to 404 Media from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon).

In-depth analyses

A New York Times Magazine piece by Bruce Schoenfeld discussed the tension between the Los Angeles Dodgers and their Latino fan base since ICE raids increased in the city in June. The team’s initially “strangely quiet” stance on the issue led to backlash and accusations of betrayal.

A report from the Migration Policy Institute documented the Trump administration’s radical expansion of expedited removal, a 29-year-old procedure, from a border-focused process to a nationwide means of fast-tracking asylum seekers’ cases and deporting most of them. Expedited removal “could, in theory, be applied to at least 2.5 million noncitizens,” estimate authors Muzaffar Chishti and Kathleen Bush-Joseph. The number includes asylum seekers and individuals granted temporary protections, such as Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole, that the Trump administration has revoked.

At his “Huddled Masses” column at the Bulwark, Adrián Carrasquillo highlighted the increase in detainee deaths since the Trump administration began. “They’re incarcerating people and allowing them to die, not providing medical facilities. There are no standards. It’s horrific,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, told Carrasquillo. The column cited body camera footage of a September 4 arrest of a documented migrant in upstate New York, in which a Border Patrol agent discussed how he routinely denies detainees permission to leave cells, even for medical issues, concluding, “They’re animals anyway. That’s what I would tell my kids all the time.”

Writing for Workday Magazine and the American Prospect, Sarah Lazare contended that the Chicago crackdown has created fear and intimidation among workers, hindering their efforts to improve working conditions and to organize for labor protections.

At Vox, Christian Paz discussed the September 24 shooting at the Dallas immigration facility, drawing attention to Democratic Party politicians’ cautious, “splintered” response, even as President Trump and other Republicans pushed talking points blaming Democrats’ past criticism of ICE for inspiring the violence. “Republicans are all-in on ICE, while Democrats are coming to realize that they need to decide what to say, and what to propose to do, about the agency,” Paz concluded.

At her newsletter, former Biden administration official Andrea Flores discussed the Democratic Party’s lack of focus on comprehensive immigration reform, asylum policy, and border issues. “The Biden administration failed to confront the Republican governors busing migrants to Democratic states. They chose not to use their power and resources to direct new arrivals toward communities that needed workers and were willing to host them.” She contrasted that to Donald Trump’s far clearer anti-immigration vision, focused on restrictionist policies. Flores called for a more inclusive approach to immigration that addresses economic hardships faced by voters.

Notes from Mexico

“Caravan” protest in Chiapas

About 1,200 migrants, the majority of them citizens of Cuba, set out on foot from Mexico’s southern border-zone city of Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, in a so-called “caravan” protest. The intended destination of this journey, which began on October 1, is not the United States: it is Mexico City.

Reporting from Tapachula, Bryan Avelar of Spain’s El País noted that the “Trump effect”—the fear of the anti-immigrant climate in the United States—has made Mexico the place where “caravan” participants now wish to settle. “And why would I want to go to the United States? They hate us there!” said a woman from Cuba.

Instead, participants, who appear to be leaderless and to have organized themselves on social media platforms, are prodding the Mexican government to speed the issuance of documentation to live and work in Mexico, and to leave Chiapas, Mexico’s poorest state. Corruption is an obstacle, even in asylum cases, Avelar reported: “According to migrants, the slowness of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance is due to a corruption network: outside the facilities, there are always one or two lawyers offering to expedite the process in exchange for a fee that can vary from 3,000 to 20,000 Mexican pesos ($150 to $1,000).”

Humanitarian aid organizations have observed an increase in the number of migrants establishing more permanent lives in Mexico, as noted by Mie Hoejris Dahl in a piece at the New Humanitarian. “Before, we didn’t see children enrolling in school,” said Joanna Williams of the Kino Border Initiative in Nogales. “There is more permanence now.” The article notes that the Trump administration’s foreign aid cuts forced a 60 percent cut in funding for UNHCR’s Mexico operations, which assist many humanitarian and migrant integration efforts, between February and June of this year.

Ciudad Juárez fire apology

The former head of the Mexican government’s National Migration Institute (INM), Francisco Garduño, issued a public apology to the victims of a March 2023 fire at the Ciudad Juárez immigrant detention station, in compliance with a court ruling. The fire killed 40 citizens of countries other than Mexico as INM guards vacated the facility with the migrants locked inside. Garduño, as the agency’s head, had faced homicide charges for the incident, but those were reduced to a minor offense requiring a court-ordered public apology.

“Reducing the responsibility of the former head of the INM to simple formal and administrative omissions is, for the victims and their families, an incomprehensible offense, a denial of the very seriousness of the events, of the value of the lives of the people who died there,” read a statement from the Fundación para la Justicia, which represents several of the victims. The Fundación called it “a case of selective justice and protection of the hierarchical structure.”

23-year-old Wilson Juárez Hernández, who suffered neural damage from smoke inhalation and cannot speak or walk properly, told Garduño “that he knew his apology was for his own personal benefit, as it would free him from criminal prosecution,” La Verdad de Juárez reported. “The difference between you and me, Garduño, is that you can walk.” Added a relative of one of the deceased, “We cannot accept an apology until there is a thorough investigation into what happened and who was responsible.”

MSF leaving Tamaulipas

Doctors Without Borders (MSF), one of the few migrant aid groups operating in Tamaulipas, regarded as Mexico’s most dangerous border state, will be ending its assistance project in Reynosa and Matamoros after eight years. MSF cited a need to reorganize its presence, in part a consequence of reduced migration to the United States since the Trump administration’s crackdowns began.

U.S. gun trafficking agreement with Mexico

The U.S. and Mexican governments announced a new initiative, “Mission Firewall,” that will take steps to address southbound weapons trafficking from the United States into Mexico. Measures include increased information sharing, more southbound inspections, and expanded Mexican access to a secure database called eTrace. “U.S. federal authorities in 2023 seized more than 1,100 pistols and rifles being smuggled to Mexico through southbound land U.S. ports of entry,” noted Border Report. “This year, that number is less than 600, according to Customs and Border Protection data.”

Border Patrol cites smugglers’ disinformation

Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector held a press conference in Spanish to seek to debunk misinformation spread by Mexican migrant smugglers on social media. The misleading messaging claims that the U.S. border is open and that new asylum laws allow for safe, easy entry. One viral video claims that, as of September 21, U.S. borders are open to migrants who have valid passports, lack significant tattoos, and can prove that they are fleeing their countries of origin. Another shows people covered with some sort of mesh, billed as a “new technique” for crossing the Rio Grande without being detected by radar.

The Trump administration continues to suspend all asylum processing at the border, though a court ruling allows people who arrive at the border claiming fear of return to their countries to seek “withholding of removal” or Convention Against Torture protections (see WOLA’s August 8 Border Update). Even those seeking such protections are ending up detained. “The days of turning yourself in and being released are over,” said supervisory Border Patrol agent Jesús Vasavilbaso.

Earlier this year, the Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, declared that States would be unable to access VOCA funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they go along with the Trump Administration’s demands that States assist in federal immigration enforcement.

“These grants help a mom and her kids stay safe when they have nowhere else to turn. They make sure a survivor can sit with a counselor after trauma, and they help advocates be there when victims need them most,” said Attorney General Dan Rayfield. “The Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to put conditions on these federal funds would have put those services at risk. This outcome ensures that critical support for victims and their families will continue here in Oregon.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable States to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives: victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that States could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents.

However, the Trump Administration, through the DOJ, previously declared that States, along with the victims and survivors they serve, would be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. In order to receive these funds, States were told that they must devote resources to assisting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal, not state, government responsibility.

In Oregon, 146 victim service providers rely on VOCA grants, and faced a loss of around $15 million in 2025 under these federal cuts. Because VOCA is funded by criminal fines—not taxpayer dollars, it was designed to support victims, not to be used as leverage for unrelated political interests.

Following the lawsuit brought forward by the coalition, the DOJ abandoned its plan to impose these conditions on $178 million in VOCA Victim Assistance Grants and $1.2 billion in VOCA Victim Compensation grants. These grants will continue to be provided to states with no requirement that States assist DHS in immigration enforcement.

Trump Administration's immigration ...","Attorney General Neronha announces key victory in multistate lawsuit against Trump Administration’s imposition of illegal conditions on grants for crime victims

Attorney General Peter F. Neronha today announced that following the filing of a lawsuit, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has now dropped its plan to impose illegal conditions on nearly $1.4 billion in Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants. Earlier this year, the Trump Administration, disregarding the clear letter of the law and intent of Congress, declared that States would be unable to access VOCA funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they accede to the Trump Administration’s immigration priorities.

“Because of the action taken by this coalition, more than a billion dollars in federal grant funding for victims of crime has been secured,” said Attorney General Neronha. “What does that tell us? The unlawful actions of this Administration are being recognized as such by the courts, and they are losing these lawsuits. It also tells us that as all-powerful as this President would like you to believe he is, he’s still limited by the letter of the law and the separation of powers. Today we celebrate the win, and tomorrow we continue the fight.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. Supported programs include victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly nine million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ), has declared that states, along with the victims and survivors they serve, will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. To receive these funds, states must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal government responsibility.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce states to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Neronha and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

In Rhode Island, VOCA grants are the primary source of funding for victim services. Most of that funding flows from VOCA’s two main grants: victim compensation grants, which provide direct financial support to crime victims, and victim assistance grants, which are almost entirely distributed to nonprofits throughout the state to provide additional support services to those impacted by crime. For federal FY 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3 million in VOCA victim assistance funds and another close to $300K in VOCA victim compensation funds. During that same time period, VOCA assistance funds were used to provide services to approximately 41,015 individuals through dozens of nonprofits, and 635 individuals received VOCA compensation payments through the State’s Crime Victim Compensation Program.

Attorney General Neronha co-led this coalition together with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and is joined in filing the lawsuit by the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

This is not the first time federal agents have detained a U.S. citizen since launching operations Midway Blitz and At Large in September, seeking to increase immigration enforcement in Chicago and throughout Illinois.
The raid happened early Tuesday at an apartment building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive.
About 300 federal agents, some landing on the roof from helicopters, descended upon the building, according to NewsNation, which was invited along for the operation.
South Shore had been a landing spot for many Venezuelans when tens of thousands of migrants were bused from the southern border to Chicago and other Democrat-led cities.","SOUTH SHORE — Federal agents detained four children who are U.S. citizens during an ICE raid this week in South Shore, according to a report.

The children were held “until they could be placed in the care of guardians,” according to a New York Times report, which cited Department of Homeland Security officials. No further details were immediately available.

This is not the first time federal agents have detained a U.S. citizen since launching operations Midway Blitz and At Large in September, seeking to increase immigration enforcement in Chicago and throughout Illinois. But it is the first time they’ve publicly acknowledged detaining American children during the operations.

The raid happened early Tuesday at an apartment building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said federal agencies arrested at least 37 people in the operation at the building, which they claimed is frequented by members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

About 300 federal agents, some landing on the roof from helicopters, descended upon the building, according to NewsNation, which was invited along for the operation.

The report didn’t mention women and children appear to be among the detained, said Brandon Lee, a spokesman with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Organizers worry many people were taken without warrants.

“These were families with their children escorted out in the middle of the night,” Lee said. “This administration is using PR efforts to try to turn communities against their neighbors.”

Residents told Block Club that agents busted open residents’ doors and took away neighbors, leaving behind ransacked units.

Rodrick Johnson, who lives in the buildling and is a U.S. citizen, said he heard “people dropping on the roof” before FBI agents kicked in his door. He was stuffed inside a van with his neighbors for what felt like several hours until agents told them the building was clear, he said.

“They didn’t tell me why I was being detained,” Johnson said. “They left people’s doors open, firearms, money, whatever, right there in the open.”

The building has long had issues, neighbors said, but agents broke open its doors, allowing others to come in and steal from tenants in the hours after the raid.

On Wednesday, walls on the building’s second floor were spray-painted with “Venezuela,” but it was unclear how long the graffiti had been there. Many of the floor’s units had broken doors and appeared to be home to young children.

South Shore had been a landing spot for many Venezuelans when tens of thousands of migrants were bused from the southern border to Chicago and other Democrat-led cities.

“People stayed at shelters there and then found apartments,” Lee said.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/100125-7500-S-South-Shore-Raid-Colin-Boyle-4078.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:58:37.191964

""At a time when federal agents are sowing chaos in Chicago, the Trump administration is holding bipartisan funding hostage,"" Illinois Gov.
Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning.
It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats.
Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City.","The Trump administration on Friday froze $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for two projects to improve Chicago's transit system.

The DOT in a statement blamed Congress' two Democratic leaders — Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries — for the federal government shutdown, which the department claimed would slow a review of the Chicago projects to ensure they do not involve ""unconstitutional practices"" related to the race or gender of construction workers.

That statement echoed a Trump administration talking point that Democrats in Congress are refusing to vote for a short-term funding agreement that would reopen the government because they insist on providing health-care benefits for ""illegal immigrants.""

Democrats call that claim a lie designed to distract from their goal of continuing the offer of enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance plan subsidies to more than 20 million Americans.

""At a time when federal agents are sowing chaos in Chicago, the Trump administration is holding bipartisan funding hostage,"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a social media post on X after the DOT's announcement.

""It's attempting to score political points but is instead hurting our economy and the hardworking people who rely on public transit to get to work or school,"" wrote Pritzker, who, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, is a Democrat.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning.

It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats.

President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have blamed Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, which hit its third day on Friday.

Trump said on Thursday that the shutdown had given him an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to cut what he called ""Democrat Agencies.""

Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City. Both Schumer and Jeffries are from New York City.

Later that same day, Vought said that the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in funding for climate-related projects and other efforts in 16 states, all of which were won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

On Friday, Vought, in a post on X, wrote, ""$2.1 billion in Chicago infrastructure projects -- specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project -- have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.""

Both projects are overseen by the Chicago Transit Authority, which operates the city's train and bus system.

The Red Line Extension project will extend that train line by 5.5 miles with four new stations between the existing terminal at 95th/Dan Ryan to 130th Street. The Red and Purple Modernization Project is reconstructing infrastructure along those color train lines.

The U.S. DOT later Friday said, ""This week, USDOT issued an interim final rule (IFR) barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants.""

""To continue implementation of this rule, USDOT today sent letters to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to inform them that"" the two CTA projects ""are also under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring,"" the DOT said.

The DOT in its statement said the freeze on the Chicago money ""is in addition to reviews of New York's Second Avenue Subway and Hudson Tunnel projects,"" the department said. ""Illinois, like New York, is well known to promote race- and sex-based contracting and other racial preferences as a public policy.""

The DOT also said that Americans ""don't care what race or gender construction workers, pipefitters, or electricians are. They just want these massive projects finally built quickly and efficiently.""

""Unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries' decision to shut down the government has negatively affected the Department's staffing resources for carrying out this important analysis,"" the department said.

""We urge Democrats in Congress to stop holding the federal government's budget hostage so USDOT can get back to the important work of the American people,"" the DOT said.

Timeline of Portland protests and Trump's National Guard deployments","PORTLAND, Ore. — It was a quiet Thursday morning outside the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland's South Waterfront. Outside was Jack, who's been coming down to protest for months now.

""Just kind of a rainy morning in Portland with a couple people doing what they can,"" he said of the protests. ""And it's evolved.""

Jack is hard to miss in the images of these recent protests. He's always dressed in a bright yellow chicken onesie and draped in the American flag.

""It kind of dismantles their narrative that we're some radical terrorist organization,"" Jack said. ""We're just kind of Portlanders keeping Portland weird.""

The protests escalate at night, Jack acknowledged, when more demonstrators come down and get rowdier — and federal officers periodically come out to meet them.

Video taken by a KGW crew Wednesday shows one person being pepper sprayed; later, a group of federal agents walked out toward the crowd with riot shields up, grabbing one person from outside and pulling him inside the ICE building.

A FOX News correspondent posted images and footage from the roof of the federal building which appear to show the same person apprehended by federal agents. ICE has yet to respond to questions about the detainment.

Also on Wednesday, Portland Police Chief Bob Day was on CNN, responding to President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the Oregon National Guard in Portland.

""Do you believe having them there is necessary; do you need them there?"" asked CNN's Kaitlin Collins.

""No. As you highlighted a moment ago, we're talking about one city block in 145 square miles,"" Day said. ""There certainly been some challenges down at the facility; Portland police has been engaged down there extensively. Over the last nine months, we've made over 20 arrests ourselves, we've conducted assault investigations, ongoing.""

According to an infographic shared by the FBI on Thursday, the feds made one arrest in the last 24 hours, allegedly for destruction of federal property. The agency said it has 27 active and pending investigations, though they claim 128 arrests since June 9.

""We are not tolerating violence or vandalism or illegal behavior, but we also are huge proponents of free speech and for people to be able to travel freely and safely about the city,"" said Day.

Johanna King, 86, lives in senior housing not far from the ICE building. On Sunday, she said she was pepper sprayed by federal agents while outside the facility.

""I don't know where to even start ... I had my kids over here for dinner we were upstairs on the 24th floor and we saw these helicopters going by,"" King said. ""We decided to go down to have a look, see what was happening.""

At least one U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter has been circling the South Waterfront since an influx of federal law enforcement resources arrived in the city last Friday. Still to come are federalized troops from the Oregon National Guard.

King said she and her family members went down and stood on public property outside the ICE building Sunday night when some of her family members started shouting at federal agents inside.

""A bunch of these black-clothed fellows appeared behind the gate — 10 or 12 of them, big crowd,"" she said. ""The kids started taunting them, 'Hey, you gonna arrest this old lady,' and we thought that was pretty funny.""

Shortly after, King said they were hit with what she described as pepper spray.

""No warning whatsoever,"" she said. ""Suddenly, I started choking and coughing and coughing and coughing, and my daughter is sneezing and coughing.""

King said there's ""no question"" that the spray or whatever it had come from the federal agents.

""We walked back; I'm coughing the whole way,"" she said with a cough. ""I'm still coughing a little.""

King is a photographer and has been documenting protests for decades, going back to the Civil Rights Movement. She's got the pictures to prove it.

""I've been through this before, you know,"" King said. ""I'm old enough at 86 to have seen (that) number one, demonstrating is really important — standing up for the rights of yourself and other people, it's really important, you have to do it — and secondly, it makes a difference in the long run.""

“This action is very dangerous,” he told RFE/RL’s Radio Farda. “It normalizes the human rights situation in Iran and puts people at risk on their return.”

Herischi represents two of those among the first deportees -- one who had sought political asylum, another who had converted from Islam.

Both were escorted onto flights with “handcuffs,” Herischi said, only to be delivered back to the very country they had fled – a country which, according to Herischi, was not designated by his clients as their extradition destination.

“I’m worried about my clients, who have arrived in Tehran,” he said. “After a few days, the authorities will begin interrogating them.”

Families Separated, Cases Unheard

Beyond his own clients, Herischi describes a deportation process that was deeply flawed.

In some cases, families were split apart: mothers and children kept in the United States while fathers were suddenly deported. If those family members are later granted asylum, he argues, the deported parent would have qualified as well.

Herischi also points to what he sees as a failure of US immigration authorities to prioritize removals.

“There was no proper prioritization,” Herischi said. “Those deported are low priority. There are still people with criminal records or even former Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members waiting here.”

Iranian officials say roughly 400 nationals have been targeted for expulsion, most accused of entering the United States illegally through Mexico. Yet the opaque process and lack of government transparency leave unanswered questions about who was deported -- and why.

The New York Times, which first reported the deportation flight, describes the arrangement between Washington and Tehran as a “rare moment of cooperation” between adversaries. But critics argue the deal has come at the expense of vulnerable migrants whose asylum applications were either denied, ignored, or left unresolved.

Human Rights At Stake

Human rights advocates have consistently urged the United States not to expel individuals to countries with poor rights records. Iran’s record, they say, is among the worst.

The Islamic republic continues widespread persecution of political dissidents, activists, religious minorities, and LGBTQ individuals -- the very groups that make up a significant portion of Iranians arriving at the American border.

I hope if you’re coming to this online, you’ll consider subscribing right here. It’s easy—and free:

Welcome to the era of what history will remember someday as the Kavanaugh Raids. Earlier this week, DHS surrounded and raided an entire apartment building in Chicago and then posted a Gotham-like sizzle reel of the highlights of that raid — armed masked stormtroopers, heavy weapons, helicopters, and search lights, all set to a Hans Zimmer-like soundtrack. Local media had a different take on it: “Armed federal agents in military fatigues busted down their doors overnight, pulling men, women and children from their apartments, some of them naked, residents and witnesses said. Agents approached or entered nearly every apartment in the five-story building, and U.S. citizens were among those detained for hours.”

It was a dark and almost certainly illegal escalation of the out-of-control agency’s war on the American people, a portrait of an authoritarian secret police that seems set to model itself on history’s worst fascist enforcers.

But let’s actually begin a hundred years ago — back when the right-wing stirred up a moral panic about subversive, criminal immigrants that led to large-scale raids by an attorney general abusing civil rights and civil liberties. (Sound familiar?)

Today, the one thing we remember about Woodrow Wilson’s attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer is that he was on the wrong side of history. Palmer oversaw a series of sweeping raids against suspected Communists during the country’s first Red Scare (there are two and they’re worth distinguishing between!) that ultimately led to the arrests and detention of perhaps as many as 10,000 people across nearly 40 US cities. The raids were led by a rising bureaucratic star named J. Edgar Hoover. Many arrests and seizures happened absent any warrants; many “radicals” were detained for simply being members of entirely legal organizations.

A cartoon from the Washington, D.C. “Evening Star” by Clifford K. Berryman, Nov. 8, 1919.

In his incredible history of that era, American Midnight, Adam Hoschchild writes, “Never was this raw underside of our nation’s life more revealingly on display than from 1917 to 1921… Major candidates for both the Republican and Democratic Party presidential nominations in 1920 campaigned on promises of mass deportations. And some people, including the vice president of the United States, suggested going further: Why limit deportation merely to immigrants? Why not permanently expel troublemakers of every sort? Also during this period, army machine-gun nests appeared in downtown Omaha and tanks on the streets of Cleveland, and armed troops patrolled many other American cities, from Butte, Montana, to Gary, Indiana. The military crafted a secret 57-page contingency plan to put the entire country under martial law. During those four years more than 450 people were imprisoned for a year or more by the federal government, and an estimated greater number by state governments, merely for what they wrote or said…. Presumably excluding slavery, the historian Alan Brinkley calls the Palmer Raids ‘arguably the greatest single violation civil liberties in American history.’”

Reading about the Palmer Raids today seems shocking — they surely were some of the darkest hours of American history — and yet today, ICE seems to be speed-running the years-long run-up to the Palmer Raids in just a matter of weeks and months. And, it appears, that the 2020s version of those same, indiscriminate, Constitution-violating raids will be known henceforth as Kavanaugh Raids, after the Supreme Court justice who helped make them possible.

Chicago media this week has been ablaze with horrifying stories from Monday’s ICE raid on a South Shore apartment building; DHS has bragged that the raid ended with 37 arrests, but the on-the-scene witness reporting describes a level of scale and brutality we’ve never seen in ICE’s raids so far. ICE blew in doors, handcuffed American citizens, rousted people from their beds in the middle of the night, and zip-tied children as they waited to figure out who was undocumented and who was a US citizen. Some US citizens evidently were handcuffed and detained for between three and five hours.

“They was terrified. The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” one resident recalled to local media. “That’s all I kept asking. What is the morality? Where’s the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘fuck them kids.’” Some residents of the building have reported their apartments were gratuitously trashed and property is missing.

There are specific moments — and right now, to be honest they’re coming too frequently — where America crosses a once unthinkable bright line, moments that are worth noticing and calling out. This week’s Chicago raid was surely one of those.

There is no warrant any judge could give — or at least, in theory, that any reasonable judge would ever sign! — that gives federal authorities the right to break down the doors of every apartment in a building in search of undocumented immigrants. That is almost exactly the definition of the so-called “general warrants” or “writs of assistance” that the British used against US colonists that helped spur the Revolution — warrants then very specifically outlawed by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

It's no surprise that ICE has been evasive about the legal basis for its Monday raid thus far: They surely don’t have one — and the fact that they feel this unhinged and can act so aggressively without possible consequence is astounding.

In part, though, the behavior by ICE is the natural and entirely foreseeable consequence of the crazy legal precedents set up by John Roberts and the Supreme Court earlier this fall in the case Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, which explicitly allowed ICE to racially profile brown people on the streets of America.

That Supreme Court decision laid bare the growing divide on the court and the Republican majority that seems set on enabling an authoritarian and inhumane regime.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor laid out the stakes and the very obvious downstream impact of a ruling that explicitly allowed racial profiling by immigration authorities: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work in a low wage job,” she wrote. “The Constitution does not permit the creation of such a second-class citizenship status.” And yet in its ruling, John Roberts’ Court did just that — switching the national presumption of innocence such that any non-white person on America’s streets now is, in the eyes of the Supreme Court and federal officers, presumed guilty of being an illegal immigrant unless and until he or she can prove to the officers’ satisfaction otherwise. (It matters, too, by the way that from what we’ve seen so far, there’s no agreed-upon way to prove your citizenship to those federal officers: We’ve even seen ICE reject the so-called gold standard “Real IDs” as sufficient for proving citizenship, after a years-long campaign by the government to force states to upgrade to Real IDs precisely in order to prove citizenship.)

Brett Kavanaugh, though, beclowned himself with a concurring opinion that laid out how he imagined friendly consensual encounters with immigration officers went on America’s streets:

The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English. If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U. S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiate the process for removal.

Kavanaugh’s writing was laughed at as soon as it came out — with good reason. There was plenty of evidence even by then that this type of stop didn’t reflect reality — that ICE officers and federal immigrant raids were brutally rounding up brown people and holding them, sometimes for days or weeks, before figuring out they were US citizens. Plenty of bystander videos showed that ICE was attacking first and asking questions later — maybe much later.

Court observer Jay Willis over at Balls and Strikes called Kavanaugh’s invented picture of policing “some of the stupidest shit I have ever encountered in the U.S.” (It’s particularly striking that Kavanaugh wrote it as a concurring opinion — that means he didn’t necessarily need to write it and instead went out of his way to write it down. Kavanaugh felt these were words particularly important to get down on paper.)

Since then, plenty more evidence has surfaced of how immigration officers are abusing the constitutional rights, civil rights, and civil liberties of US citizens who happen to not look like Brett Kavanaugh or walk around in places other than his fancy wealthy DC neighborhood. The New York Times this week cited this week at least 15 documented cases of US citizens being detained by ICE or immigration authorities. (If we know of 15 — how many more don’t we know about?) In one case, a Florida state trooper tried to tase a US citizen in a vehicle stop as the citizen shouted, “I’m from here!”

“You’ve got no rights here. You’re illegal, brother,” a trooper is heard saying on video, a phrase that is simultaneously factually incorrect and deeply chilling.

The most dramatic case, though, came out in a lawsuit in recent days: A 79-year-old US citizen filed a lawsuit last week against DHS, alleging ICE officers broke his ribs — knocking him to the ground at least twice on camera — and detained him for more than 12 hours before releasing him. “This is the way ICE is operating in our community,” the man’s lawyer said. “They use physical force, they don’t speak to the people in order to ascertain who is there legally in order to do their job. Instead, they immediately resort to force.”

That rapid escalation to force in ICE enforcement actions is so common that military veterans are speaking out about how dangerous they think ICE is. “these are not trained professionals. As a military member, I can tell you the way they are handling weapons is reckless and dangerous,” on 14-year veteran said. “I’ve seen ICE agents with fingers on their trigger, using real M16s and M9s, pointing them at people. They’re just trigger happy, and there is no trigger discipline.” It does not seem an exaggeration to imagine that we are not that far on any given day away from a Kent State.

Online, people have taken to call ICE’s racial profiling by the historical name it rightly deserves: “Kavanaugh Stops.” Now, just weeks after getting permission from the Supreme Court to racially profile people on the streets and create exactly the type of “second-class citizens” that Justice Sotomayor warned about, ICE has escalated into what we should be calling “Kavanaugh raids.” (I, for one, am eager to see the first time “Kavanaugh stops” or “Kavanaugh raids” are cited in actual legal motions, opinions, and rulings because that is surely coming in the weeks and months ahead.)

Brett Kavanaugh and the ICE leadership would surely do well to read up on how the Palmer Raids are now viewed by history.",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/b0fa02c8-4f8b-4d9c-8640-ec60315b60a2/Evening_Star_Cartoon_by_Clifford_K._Berryman_Nov_8_1919.jpg?t=1759499875,N,,2025-10-03 10:57:14.151331

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons fired back at a progressive mayor who accused the agency of waging a war on her community and slammed ""violent rioters"" who he said have been ""laying siege"" to immigration enforcement operations in the Chicago area for weeks.

The ICE processing center in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, has been at the center of chaotic protests for weeks. Protesters have blocked law enforcement vehicles and shouted threats against officers. In response, federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly deployed riot control measures and made several arrests.

On Friday, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson sent a letter to ICE Field Office Director Russell Hott last week in which she accused the agency of ""making war"" on her community and ""endangering nearby village residents"" with its response to the protests, WTTW reported.

In response, ICE accused Thompson of ""distorting reality"" and ""pointing her finger in the wrong direction, while our officers are protecting her community — and others — from real threats, while also facing skyrocketing violence against them, including at the Broadview facility.""

The agency said that ""in the past week alone, violent rioters have been arrested for assault and obstruction, and three of them were carrying loaded firearms to protest.""

Lyons responded to Thompson with a follow-up letter this week in which he criticized her for heating up the rhetoric against ICE and enabling ""agitators to escalate violence,"" placing federal officers and residents in harm’s way.

He said that repeated requests for assistance from state and local law enforcement, including the Broadview Police Department, have gone unanswered, forcing federal officials to take their own crowd control measures.

""Chants of ‘shoot ICE’ and physical attempts to breach the Broadview facility cannot be dismissed as peaceful protest.

Blanket Order In practice, a blanket order forbidding DOJ lawyers from seeking stays in civil immigration cases would apply to a wide range of cases relevant to the Trump administration’s aggressive border security agenda.
Department veterans said they were surprised by the guidance, given that litigation extensions were sought in most civil immigration proceedings during prior shutdowns.
The exception for civil immigration cases was reserved for legitimate threats to national security or public safety, such as the removals of people convicted of violent crimes.
Various DOJ offices are also able to keep employees working if they have leftover funds from other noncongressional streams, such as from fees collected in settlements.","The Justice Department has directed US attorneys to proceed on all civil immigration cases during the government shutdown, departing from protocols that restricted work on such matters when federal funding lapses.

Guidance from the deputy attorney general’s office “is that we should NOT seek a stay on any civil immigration matters, whether affirmative or defensive,” said Francey Hakes, director of the Executive Office for US Attorneys, in an Oct. 1 email to all 93 US attorneys that was obtained by Bloomberg Law.

That directive appears contrary to DOJ’s shutdown contingency plan published this week. The plan said “civil litigation will be curtailed or postponed to the extent this can be done without compromising to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

It further advised civil litigators to request that courts postpone active cases, except for those that meet the exception for cases where life or property is at risk.

While in prior shutdowns—including during President Donald Trump’s first term—DOJ interpreted this same exception to generally not permit civil immigration work unless judges denied motions to postpone, this one comes after Trump declared a national emergency due to what he called the national security threat posed by illegal migration.

That declaration may prompt the administration to assert a broader interpretation of which federal employees and types of work can continue when Congress fails to fund the government.

A department spokesperson declined to comment about Hakes’ shutdown guidance. Hakes is a former prosecutor and Fox News commentator appointed in July to run the department’s central office for advising the nation’s chief federal law enforcement officials.

Breaking From Practice

There are other indications that Trump loyalists within the Justice Department are interpreting shutdown protocols for civil litigators to break from past practice.

US attorneys based in Los Angeles, Miami, and New Jersey have ordered their staffs, including civil litigators, to continue working since the shutdown began Oct. 1, according to multiple people familiar with the situation.

The Washington, DC, US attorney’s office, which has spearheaded a White House crackdown on street crime, has yet to issue any officewide shutdown instructions, said two people familiar with the matter.

Other US attorney’s offices and legal divisions within the Justice Department’s headquarters have mostly furloughed civil litigators, except when when judges deny extension requests, said additional sources familiar with those offices.

“Plans are based on each U.S. Attorney’s discretion (in consultation with EOUSA) based on the nature and scope of the district’s case load and relative staffing, which of course varies considerably across the 93 offices,” a department spokesperson said in a statement, referring to the shorthand for the executive office for US attorneys.

Criminal prosecutors remain working across the department, as is customary in past shutdowns.

The prohibition on seeking stays comes even as at least 10 district courts have issued standing orders automatically extending some deadlines or pausing civil cases in which the federal government is a party.

It also contradicts the posture of DOJ’s civil division, which sought a stay Oct. 1 in a major legal challenge to the administration’s cancellation of temporary protected status for about half a million Venezuelans. But that case is being handled by the civil division’s office of immigration litigation, which has distributed a greater share of its caseload to US attorney’s offices this year.

Blanket Order

In practice, a blanket order forbidding DOJ lawyers from seeking stays in civil immigration cases would apply to a wide range of cases relevant to the Trump administration’s aggressive border security agenda. It would affect individuals appealing final deportation orders or visa denials, denaturalization proceedings, and lawsuits challenging administration immigration policies.

Department veterans said they were surprised by the guidance, given that litigation extensions were sought in most civil immigration proceedings during prior shutdowns.

“Approaching it with a broad stroke is a tough fit with the statutory requirements,” said Jeff Robins, a longtime career official at DOJ’s office of immigration litigation, who left last year. “I suppose it’s a good thing for everyone that they may still be open for civil defensive business, but it’s not the normal.”

The safety of life and protection of property standard is laid out in the Antideficiency Act, which requires DOJ and other federal agencies to cease certain functions that haven’t been congressional appropriated.

In theory, members of the public can request that the Justice Department’s inspector general investigate alleged violations of the statute. But it’s rare for that to result in employee discipline or other consequences.

People who coordinated prior DOJ shutdown plans said that they couldn’t recall an instance in which offices would automatically declare their entire civil teams exempt from furloughs before giving the courts a chance to rule on requests for postponements.

These former department officials, who like most people interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal or to share internal deliberations, said the default was usually to ask judges for stays.

The exception for civil immigration cases was reserved for legitimate threats to national security or public safety, such as the removals of people convicted of violent crimes.

For eight months, the conservative supermajority has helped Trump amass power, temporarily lifting about 20 rulings that were thwarting his initiatives.

The Supreme Court in June used a group of challenges to Trump’s initiative to make it harder for federal trial judges to block disputed government policies nationwide.","The US Supreme Court so far has largely accommodated Donald Trump’s assertions of sweeping presidential power. The term that starts Monday will determine just how far the court is willing to go.

For eight months, the conservative supermajority has helped Trump amass power, temporarily lifting about 20 rulings that were thwarting his initiatives. The court now is positioned to consider the underlying legal questions behind his imposition of global tariffs, bid to control independent regulatory agencies - including the Federal Reserve - and effort to restrict automatic birthright citizenship.

The stakes are high. Chief Justice John Roberts and his court must decide what lines to draw with a president who has repeatedly said his election means he can do whatever he wants. With the Republican-controlled Congress showing little interest in resisting Trump, any constitutional guardrails will have to come from a court that under Roberts’ leadership for the past 20 years has expanded White House power.

“We’re going to learn about the extent to which this court is willing to stand up to the president,” said Gillian Metzger, an administrative and constitutional law professor at Columbia Law School.

The presidential-powers showdowns will occur alongside a series of cases that could transform federal voting law - and potentially bolster Republican prospects in the coming elections – as well as what are sure to be polarizing clashes over transgender athletes and counseling aimed at changing a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

The start of the nine-month term follows a flood of litigation during the opening months of Trump’s term, most of it stemming from the torrent of far-reaching executive actions he issued since his Jan. 20 inauguration.

The Supreme Court has already acted on 23 emergency requests from Trump, with the conservative majority giving him at least a significant part of what he sought in 20 of those cases, often over dissents from the three liberal justices. Those include fights over mass firings, federal grant funding, alleged racial profiling by immigration agents and access to sensitive Social Security information by the Department of Government Efficiency.

The justices took the unusual step of scheduling arguments in January to consider whether Trump can temporarily oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook while her case continues. The court said on Wednesday she could stay in the job until then. The move effectively put off until next year a test of its willingness to protect the Fed’s independence from the White House after Trump has repeatedly criticized the board and Chair Jerome Powell and demanded interest rate cuts.

The court also has pending emergency requests on the rights of Venezuelan immigrants and the gender designation on passports. And many more cases are certainly on the way.

Roberts’ vision

The 70-year-old Roberts has been a key player in Trump’s successes. The 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush is a longstanding proponent of a strong presidency, though not the all-powerful one envisioned by Trump.

It was Roberts who authored Trump’s most far-reaching victory, the 2024 decision that gave presidents criminal immunity for official acts while in office. The ruling, which described the president as “the only person who alone composes a branch of government,” shielded Trump from a trial over the 2021 Capitol riot and, in the view of critics, let him start his new White House term with a sense of impunity.

The decision also marked a break from Roberts’ more measured views on presidential power, some legal experts say.

“It remains to be seen how much of the earlier version of Roberts remains – or whether he’s somehow become convinced that what the constitutional order needs right now is more presidential power and immunity,” said Kate Shaw, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Roberts has long enjoyed a reputation as a minimalist who tends to prefer narrow, consensus decisions where possible. But since Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s 2020 confirmation, Roberts has had to manage a court with five other conservatives – including three Trump appointees - a group that at times wants to go further and faster in reshaping the law than he does.

“It’s clear that there is not a majority for minimalism, or at least not consistently, and that puts him in a difficult position,” said Jonathan Adler, a constitutional and administrative professor at William & Mary Law School.

Roberts didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Agency heads

Roberts has mostly been on board with this year’s Trump decisions. In the 20 rulings backing the president, Roberts has dissented even in part only twice, both times in cases involving the administration’s cutting off of federal grants.

He has been a driving force behind rulings that let the president fire the heads of independent agencies despite job protections Congress gave those officials to shield them from political pressure. In April he took the unusual step of clearing Trump to temporarily remove Democratic members of two independent agencies – the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board – without waiting for the full court to weigh in.

The court is preparing to hear arguments in December to consider overturning the 1935 precedent that provided the legal foundation for independent agencies. That ruling, known as Humphrey’s Executor, said President Franklin Delano Roosevelt lacked power to fire a Republican member of the Federal Trade Commission.

A key question will be how, if at all, the case affects the Federal Reserve. When the full court reaffirmed Roberts’ decision to let Trump remove the NLRB and MSPB members, the majority went out of its way to suggest the Fed could keep its independence, calling it a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.”

Trump, who has blasted the Fed for not cutting interest rates more quickly, is now effectively trying to sidestep that ruling by moving to fire Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, which she denies.

Signature tariffs

The court’s views on the legality of Trump’s tariffs are far less clear. The justices will hear arguments Nov. 5 without having been asked to issue the type of preliminary order that might have hinted at their leanings.

At stake are import taxes affecting trillions of dollars in trade. The central issue is whether Trump can impose them using a law that gives the president a panoply of tools to address national security, foreign policy and economic emergencies – but that doesn’t mention tariffs.

Although three lower courts have ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, the president will have some potentially key advantages at the Supreme Court. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has already signaled he won’t apply the so-called major questions doctrine, a legal argument the court invoked repeatedly to curb President Joe Biden’s agenda.

Under the major questions doctrine, federal agencies need explicit congressional authorization to take actions that have sweeping economic or political significance. But in a June ruling involving the Federal Communications Commission, Kavanaugh said the doctrine shouldn’t apply in the realm of foreign affairs and national security.

“The usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the president substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people,” Kavanaugh wrote.

For Roberts, the question may be less about legal doctrine than about his stomach for invalidating a president’s biggest economic initiative. Roberts famously avoided doing that in 2012 when he cast the deciding vote to uphold President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

“They’re really going to have to grapple with whether they are going to overturn the president’s signature economic policy,” said former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who served as Biden’s top Supreme Court lawyer. That sort of consideration “weighs on” Roberts, she said in remarks last month at William & Mary Law School.

The justices are hearing the case on an ultra-expedited basis, suggesting they might try to rule well before their term ends in late June or early July.

Citizenship test

Birthright citizenship is all but certain to pose a third major test of Trump’s early agenda. Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order would jettison what has been the widespread understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on virtually everyone born on US soil. Trump would restrict that to babies with at least one parent who is a US citizen or green card holder.

The Supreme Court in June used a group of challenges to Trump’s initiative to make it harder for federal trial judges to block disputed government policies nationwide. Now the administration is asking the justices to take up two new appeals and uphold the executive order itself. Lower courts have uniformly ruled against Trump, saying his approach violates the Constitution and federal immigration law.

Although the court’s conservatives backed Trump the first time around, they didn’t indicate they agreed with his interpretation of the 14th Amendment or were inclined to back his executive order. The administration may get a “less receptive audience” than it has with its emergency requests, said Greg Garre, who served as solicitor general under Bush.

“It is still extremely early to gauge the relationship between the administration and the court and the trajectory they are on,” Garre said. “We’re not even a year into the second Trump presidency. Things could look different a year or two from now.”

“Information provided to Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates” the app store guidelines because “it’s purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group,” the email states.
Aaron has said the ICEBlock app was intended to help people avoid contact with ICE agents.
Apple, in a statement, said the company removed the apps Thursday after communication with law enforcement.
When users log a sighting in the ICEBlock app, it warns: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only.","Following a request from the US Department of Justice, Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar apps that allow people to alert others nearby about sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their area. President Donald Trump and his administration have railed against the apps for months, arguing that they pose a threat to ICE agents.

In an email to ICEBlock creator Joshua Aaron, Apple wrote that “upon re-evaluation,” the app does not comply with its app store guidelines around “objectionable” and “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,” according to a copy of the message viewed by CNN.

“Information provided to Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates” the app store guidelines because “it’s purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group,” the email states.

Aaron has said the ICEBlock app was intended to help people avoid contact with ICE agents. FBI Director Kash Patel said last month that a man who shot at a Dallas ICE field office planned the attack for weeks and “searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.” Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, said in June, “An app that lets anyone zero in on their locations is like inviting violence against them.”

The Justice Department, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond Friday to requests for comment. In a statement published on Fox News Digital, which first reported Apple’s removal of the apps, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said ICEBlock and similar apps crossed a line.

“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi said in her statement to Fox.

ICEBlock and similar apps have been available on Apple’s app store since the spring. Apple, in a statement, said the company removed the apps Thursday after communication with law enforcement. The company didn’t specifically cite ICE or DHS, but Bondi told Fox that the Justice Department reached out to Apple, “demanding” the company remove the apps.

“Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,” Apple said in a statement. Apple and its CEO Tim Cook have in recent months sought to strengthen the company’s relationship with the White House, amid policy changes from Trump that could threaten its business.

Aaron, the ICEBlock creator, has denied that the app was intended to incite violence against law enforcement. In a statement to CNN Friday, Aaron said he is “incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions today” and called the claim that ICEBlock was designed to harm law enforcement officers “patently false.” The app had more than 1 million users prior to its removal, according to Aaron. The app was only available on Apple’s iOS, because Aaron previously said he would not be able to guarantee anonymity for users on Android.

“ICEBlock is no different from crowdsourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple’s own Maps app, implements as part of its core services,” he said. “This is protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We are determined to fight this with everything we have.”

Aaron told CNN in June that he hoped the crowdsourced notifications would help people avoid interactions with ICE. When users log a sighting in the ICEBlock app, it warns: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.”

“Our mission has always been to protect our neighbors from the terror this administration continues to (rain) down on the people of this nation,” he said in his Friday statement.

But the White House has repeatedly admonished the apps and the media coverage about them. After CNN reported about ICEBlock in June, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt sharply criticized CNN, saying at a news briefing that it was “unacceptable that a major network would promote such an app that is encouraging violence against law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our country safe.”

In a statement at the time, CNN denied it was promoting the app.

“This is an app that is publicly available to any iPhone user who wants to download it,” a CNN spokesperson said. “There is nothing illegal about reporting the existence of this or any other app, nor does such reporting constitute promotion or other endorsement of the app by CNN.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-24t155217z-1447950275-rc2eyganyo1i-rtrmadp-3-usa-shooting-ice.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-03 10:57:17.901299

The Cook County Sheriff's Office said at least five people were arrested. They are facing charges such as resisting, obstruction and aggravated battery to a police officer.

The pushing, shoving and arrests happened shortly after 9 a.m. Chopper 7 was over the scene near 25th and Lexington, where at least eight demonstrators appeared to be detained.

That clash came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino were seen on the ICE facility's roof just before 8 a.m.

Noem and Bovino were accompanied by several armed agents, cameras and a production crew.

Demonstrators against immigration enforcement have been at the facility all morning, demanding transparency and immediate action over possible safety violations and unlawful detentions.

The protesters are seeking answers about the conditions inside the ICE facility and want elected officials to be allowed inside to inspect it.

Illinois State Police and other law enforcement are on the scene, at the request of Broadview police, for extra enforcement.

Earlier Friday morning, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker shared that Noem was in Illinois.

The governor is demanding that Noem hold a press conference to answer questions about ongoing immigration raids in the Chicago area.

The area has been overwhelmed, at times, with people unhappy with ICE operations in recent weeks. It has led to confrontations with agents, and five people were charged following protests last weekend.

Meanwhile, Broadview officials have launched three criminal investigations into ICE activity.

During a press conference earlier this week, village officials accused ICE of endangering first responders, residents and protesters near an ICE facility through the use of tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.

Full statement from Pritzker:

""Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities.

Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability. Last time when the secretary was here, she snuck in during the early morning to film social media videos and fled before sunrise. It's been nearly 45 days since Secretary Noem has held an official press conference, so it's time she faces the public and takes questions from the press to be held accountable for the Trump Administration's gross misconduct.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17930277_100325-wls-raw-broadview-chopper-arrests9a--vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-03 12:57:31.527151

The Trump administration announced today that it is putting $2.1 billion in funding for Chicago infrastructure projects on hold, the latest move to target Democratic-run cities during the government shutdown.

The director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, said in a post on X that the funding is for “specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project.” He said it has been “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”

EMILY’s List, the political group supporting female Democratic candidates who favor abortion rights, endorsed Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton for the Senate today, picking sides in the state’s crowded Democratic primary.

It’s the group’s first endorsement in a Senate campaign in the 2026 midterm elections, and it’s a significant boost in support for Stratton — who isn’t the only woman running in the open Democratic primary.

Stratton is running against a field that includes Rep. Robin Kelly — a former state Democratic Party chair whom EMILY’s List has endorsed in the past, when she ran for her seat in the House — and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who has built up significant cash in his campaign account and has already spent more than $7 million on advertising in the race, according to AdImpact.

Trump’s victory last year was fueled in part by improvement among young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed Trump are beginning to sour on his administration’s approach to immigration and the economy.

“I believe my trust in the administration has completely nosedived because of how he’s mishandled things,” said Anthony H., a 22-year-old Republican from Nevada, pointing to immigration and foreign affairs.

Anthony was one of 14 swing-state Trump voters under age 30 who participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 “Deciders” series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago.

These voters were a key part of Trump’s coalition in 2024, as he made gains among 18-to-29-year-old voters, especially young men, compared to his 2020 loss. Trump won 43% of young voters in this age group last year after winning 36% of them in 2020, according to the NBC News Exit Poll. The exit poll also showed Trump winning 49% of young men in 2024, compared to 48% for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, while Trump trailed among young women, winning 38% of that group.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., continued to blame Democrats for the government shutdown that began Wednesday in an interview on NBC’s “TODAY,"" saying it's up to them to end the impasse.

""We’ve done exactly what is always done, a very clean, very simple resolution to keep the government open so that we can negotiate all these other issues,"" Johnson said, explaining Congress was in the midst of negotiations on spending levels for the coming year, but ran out of time to pass those measures when the fiscal year ended.

""They’ve rejected it because they’re trying to make a political play,"" he said of Democrats, whom he accused of unnecessarily introducing a health care debate into what should be a simple, weekslong extension of current funding to buy time to talk about such issues.

""The ball is in the courts are the Democrats, not the Republicans,"" he said. ""The Republicans have done our job, done our work, and now Chuck Schumer and 43 of his colleagues have to decide to do the right thing.""

Johnson also dismissed multiple polls that found more Americans believe Republicans are responsible for the shutdown than Democrats.

Asked if Republicans are losing the messaging battle, he said, ""The Democrats are trying to make this about politics, and I'm not surprised by some of the polls, because the mainstream media is advancing their narrative.""

For people who closely follow the U.S. economy, the first Friday of every month is known as “jobs Friday,” when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the previous month’s employment report at precisely 8:30 a.m. ET.

But on this jobs Friday, September’s employment data — a critical window into the health of the U.S. labor market — will not be released. Like many other federal offices, the BLS is temporarily closed because of the ongoing government shutdown.

Until Congress approves its funding, the bureau’s more than 2,000 employees will remain furloughed, unable to release any reports. The data blackout comes at a perilous time for the U.S. economy.

Most of Trump’s supporters back keeping enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, the central obstacle in ending the government shutdown, according to a new poll from the nonpartisan health policy research group KFF. It was conducted Sept. 23 through Sept. 29, just days before Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the government open.

More than 22 million people receive the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them. Losing the subsidies could mean that average out-of-pocket premium payments could double in 2026, from $888 a year to $1,904, an earlier KFF analysis found.

Around 4 million people are projected to go without coverage next year because they can no longer afford it, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending them would cost the federal government around $350 billion over the next decade.

The new survey found 59% of Republicans and 57% of “Make American Great Again” supporters favor extending the enhanced subsidies.

The Senate convenes at 11:30 a.m. and will vote starting at 1:30 p.m. on the Democratic and Republican short-term spending bills after refraining from votes on the legislation yesterday in observance of Yom Kippur.

The bills under consideration have already failed to advance three times.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters yesterday that if the measures are blocked a fourth time, the Senate will probably adjourn until Monday, when the House is also planning to be in session.

“They’ll have a fourth chance tomorrow to vote to keep, to open up the government,” Thune said. “And if that fails, then we have the weekend to think about it. We’ll come back. We’ll vote again on Monday.”

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN THE CARIBBEAN

President Trump has “determined” that cartels involved in drug trafficking are “nonstate armed groups” the actions of which “constitute an armed attack against the United States” and with whom the United States is engaged in “noninternational armed conflict,” the Trump administration told Congress in a confidential notice this week. The document also asserted that cartels “illegally and directly cause the deaths of tens of thousands of American citizens each year,” and refers to the crew of the vessel struck by U.S. forces in mid-September as “unlawful combatants.” The White House yesterday said that the notice was an explanation of the legality of Trump’s actions and does not represent a new policy shift. Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times; Leo Shane III, Myah Ward, and Connor O’Brien report for POLITICO.

In a closed-door Senate Armed Services Committee meeting, senators from both sides of the aisle questioned the Defense Department’s legal justification for striking alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean and urged officials to devise a stronger legal case, sources say. During the Wednesday meeting, the Pentagon general counsel, Earl Matthews, repeatedly argued that Trump’s designation of some Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations granted the Defense Department unilateral authority to use military force. Matthews reportedly also refused to provide a written justification for the strikes. Lara Seligman, Alexander Ward, and Siobhan Hughes report for the Wall Street Journal.

Venezuela yesterday criticised what it described as an “illegal incursion” of U.S. fighter jets into an area of Venezuelan air traffic control, 75 kilometres from the Venezuelan coastline. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said the U.S. activity was “vulgarity, a provocation, a threat to the security of the nation.” John Silk reports for DW.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Trump administration has approved and released $230 million in funding for Lebanon’s security forces this week, according to U.S. and Lebanese sources. A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. assistance is intended to support the forces “as they work to assert Lebanese sovereignty across the country and fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701.” Patricia Zengerle and Maya Gebeily report for Reuters.

Taiwan “will not agree” to produce 50% of its semiconductors on U.S. soil, Taiwan’s Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said on Wednesday. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last weekend insisted in a TV interview that Taiwan should split its chip production evenly between domestic and U.S. facilities. John Liu reports for CNN.

Trump said yesterday that he would meet with the Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, to determine which “Democrat agencies” he could cut and whether the “cuts will be temporary or permanent.” Trump referred to the shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to achieve his agenda in the same social media post. In an interview yesterday, Trump said “we could cut projects that they wanted, favourite projects”, adding “I am allowed to cut things that should have never have been approved […] and I will probably do that.” Tony Romm reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

Several furloughed workers at the Education Department found out yesterday that their out-of-office email messages had been changed without their knowledge to reflect the Trump administration’s view that the shutdown had been caused by Democrats. “Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 531 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations,” the email said. Eileen Sullivan and Michael C. Bender report for the New York Times.

A third of White House staff will be furloughed during the shutdown, while all 45 DOGE officials and most Office of Management and Budget staff will continue working as their compensation comes from a source other than annual appropriations, according to a contingency plan posted online yesterday. Sophia Cai reports for POLITICO.

Senior federal officials have advised several agencies against firing employees during the shutdown, warning that the strategy might violate appropriations law, two sources told the Washington Post. Plans for such firings have been developed across several agencies, according to two federal officials. A senior White House official said those plans outline firings for fewer than 16,000 people, a smaller reduction in force than the White House previously projected. Emily Davies and Hannah Natanson report.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Justice Department is set to close the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, an inter-agency office created in the 1980s to tackle major drug cartels, according to documents seen by Reuters. The documents show the DOJ will also shutter the Community Relations Service, focused on mediating racial and ethnic tensions in the United States, and the Office for Access to Justice, which works on access to legal aid. Sources say that current and former officials said they are surprised by the plan to close the Task Forces, as the type of cases it oversees is aligned with the Trump administration’s efforts to pursue major drug-trafficking organizations. Sarah N. Lynch reports.

Trump is considering providing over $10 billion to U.S. farmers due to the economic fallout sparked by his tariffs, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Sources said that Trump and his team are thinking about using tariff revenue to fund the majority of the aid, with much of it going towards soybean producers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said yesterday that the government would make an announcement next Tuesday regarding support for U.S. farmers in light of China’s refusal to buy soybeans. Brian Schwartz, Patrick Thomas, and Natalie Andrews report; Reuters reports.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has stopped the release of hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency preparedness grants, requesting that states prove their population counts before receiving the money, FEMA told CNN. States started receiving notices on Tuesday that they must submit a population certification, outlining their methodology, and confirm those deported under US immigration laws are not included in the count. Gabe Cohen reports.

FBI Director Kash Patel has fired a FBI employee who displayed a Pride flag in his workspace, according to several sources. Patel did not mention the Pride flag by name in the dismissal but said he was being dismissed for “poor judgment” and “an inappropriate display of political signage.” The sources said that the employee had received multiple awards for service during his career and had been the field office diversity program coordinator. Josh Campbell and Jamie Gangel report for CNN.

The University of Texas said yesterday it would be eager to sign up to the Trump administration’s list of demands in return for favourable terms for government financial aid. Most of the eight other institutions that were approached have not indicated whether they would agree to the terms. Anemona Hartocollis, Michael C. Bender, and Alan Blinder report for the New York Times.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has fired Dr Jeanne Marrazzo, leading scientist at the National Institutes of Health, three weeks after she filed a whistle-blower complaint against the Trump administration, according to her lawyer and copy of the termination letter. The dismissal letter did not provide any explanation. Dr Marazzo’s lawyer has said that the firing was retaliatory. Benjamin Mueller reports for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Apple said yesterday that it had removed ICEBlock, the most popular ICE-tracking app, from the App Store following “information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated” with the app. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters.

As of yesterday, the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay is holding no detained migrants, following the transfer of the 18 remaining men on a charter flight to the United States. Since the base was set up in February, fewer than 700 people have been held there despite plans for the base to hold tens of thousands of migrants. The Department for Homeland Security has not responded to a question of why the base has been entirely cleared. Carol Rosenberg reports for the New York Times.

Training for the first group of Army Reserve lawyers selected to be temporary immigration judges by the Trump administration is set to start on Monday, according to an email reviewed by AP News.The administration is planning to bring in as many as 600 military-trained attorneys to make immigration decisions following the firing of dozens of existing immigration judges this year. Julie Watson and Amy Taxin report.

Immigration journalist Mario Guevara is set to be deported to El Salvador today, according to his legal team. A federal appeals court this week denied his emergency request for stay. Victoria Albert reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The superintendent of Iowa’s largest school district, Ian Roberts, was charged yesterday in federal court for possessing firearms while illegally in the United States, following his detention last week by ICE agents. Hannah Fingerhut reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Nvidia and Fujitsu agreed today to collaborate on AI to deliver smart robots using Nvidia’s chips. “The AI industrial revolution has already begun. Building the infrastructure to power it is essential in Japan and around the world,” Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said alongside his Fujitsu counterpart Takahito Tokita. Yuri Kageyama reports for AP News.

A multibillion-dollar deal signed in May to send Nvidia’s AI chips to the United Arab Emirates is facing delays, frustrating Nvidia chief Jensen Huang and some senior administration officials, sources told the Wall Street Journal.The UAE promised to invest in the United States in exchange for Nvidia’s chips supplies but the investment is yet to arrive, the sources said. Brian Schwartz, Amrith Ramkumar, and Josh Dawsey report.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 57 Palestinians in Gaza yesterday, according to health officials. 29 people were killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza, the Nasser Hospital indicated. Separately, officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said they had received 16 people killed by strikes. Doctors without Borders said one of its occupational therapists was killed in a strike that wounded four others. Wafaa Shurafa and Bassem Mroue report for AP News.

Mediators yesterday made contact with Izz al-Din al Haddad, the head of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza, who indicated that he would not agree to the U.S. ceasefire proposal as the plan is designed to destroy Hamas, BBC News has been told. Rushdi Abualouf reports.

Many Palestinians in Gaza have voiced their support for the current ceasefire plan, according to interviews in Gaza. Some said that news of the proposal on Monday sent a rare flash of hope through Gaza, while others said it was clear there were terms Hamas would not agree to. Abdelhalim Awad, living in Deir al Balah, said that he would accept almost “any price” to end the war but that Hamas would not do the same. “They don’t care about what people think […] if they cared about that, we wouldn’t be in this situation.” Liam Stack reports for the New York Times.

Israeli forces yesterday blocked the road to Gaza City, preventing those who had left the city in search of food or shelter from returning. “This is the last opportunity for Gaza residents who wish to do so to move south and leave Hamas operatives in Gaza City itself in the face of the IDF’s continuing full-scale operations,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

Israel’s interception of the boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla sparked protests across Europe and South America yesterday. Israel has detained more than 450 activists. Reuters reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

A U.S. federal judge this week dismissed a lawsuit accusing the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) of allegedly allowing its funds to be diverted to support Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. Contrary to the position advanced by the Trump administration, the judge found that as part of the United Nations, as UNRWA was protected by immunity and could not be sued. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of about 100 Israeli plaintiffs, the estates of some of the victims, and at least one person whom Hamas held hostage. Benjamin Weiser reports for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

U.S. long-range Tomahawk missile shipments to Ukraine appear unlikely as current stock is committed to the U.S. Navy and other uses, according to a U.S. official and other sources. The U.S. official said there was no shortage of shorter-distance weapons that could be supplied to Kyiv. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that he had no plans to invade NATO countries. Putin criticized “European elites” for “whipping up hysteria” about a “Russian threat,” denying Russia’s involvement in the drone violations of Danish and Norwegian airspace last week. Nataliya Vasilyeva reports for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.N. High Commission for Human Rights Volker Türk said yesterday that the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary killed at least 91 Sudanese civilians in the besieged city of el-Fasher last month. Türk said the city’s Draga Oula neighbourhood had been repeatedly attacked during RSF shelling, drone strikes, and ground incursions between September 19 and 29. According to the Sudan Doctors Network, an RSF missile yesterday killed 16 people and injured 21 others in the city. AP News

Türk also told the U.N. Human Rights Council yesterday he is concerned that Haiti’s use of “lethal force” against gangs was “unnecessary and disproportionate.” According to Türk, Haitian police units summarily executed 174 people for alleged gang affiliation this year, while government drone strikes against alleged gang members had killed at least 559 people. “Most of these drone strikes are likely unlawful under international human rights law,” Türk said. Farge reports for Reuters.

Russia has mounted a vast disinformation campaign in the Czech Republic ahead of the parliamentary elections today and tomorrow, according to an investigation by Czech outlet Voxpot. According to Voxpot, 16 Russia-linked websites containing false information and conspiracy theories, are producing more content than all Czech traditional media outlets combined. 300 TikTok accounts promoting pro-Russia narratives have garnered over 5 million views per week, more than the combined reach of mainstream party leaders, Czech analysts say. Dana Nickel and Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewin report for POLITICO.

Broadview ICE protest

What we know:

The protest marks the fifth consecutive Friday of demonstrations at the suburban Chicago processing center. Early Friday, the scene outside the facility was quiet, with a single police squad car present and new security measures in place, including fencing and concrete barriers at Lexington and Beech streets.

As of 7:30 a.m. dozens of protesters, carrying signs and protective gear, built up along the back entrance to the facility. Illinois State Police in riot gear and Broadview police were among several law enforcement agencies at the scene controlling crowds.

At least 12 protesters were seen being handcuffed and taken into custody.

Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino also made an appearance on the roof of the ICE facility surrounded by armed personnel. An armored truck was also present at the scene.

Protest organizers said the Broadview center is not intended to hold detainees for more than 12 hours at a time, but claim individuals are being deprived of basic necessities such as beds, blankets and access to hygiene facilities.

Activists also allege ICE has blocked elected officials from inspecting the facility, despite requirements they say are set by law.

ICE agents have used pepper balls, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters to allow vehicles to enter and exit the facility. Five people were charged in Saturday's demonstrations, including a couple who were reportedly carrying guns.

Big picture view:

The DHS announced Thursday that since launching Operation Midway Blitz on Sept. 8, over 900 people have been arrested in the Chicago area.

Pritzker calls out Noem

What they're saying:

Pritzker released the following statement early Friday, demanding answers from DHS Sec. Kristi Noem, who is reportedly in the state:

""Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities.

Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability. Last time when the secretary was here, she snuck in during the early morning to film social media videos and fled before sunrise. It's been nearly 45 days since Secretary Noem has held an official press conference, so it’s time she faces the public and takes questions from the press to be held accountable for the Trump Administration’s gross misconduct.

Some of these charges include assaulting federal officers, failure to comply, -and depredation of government property.

On Tuesday night, .

On Thursday afternoon, we spoke with protesters at the ICE facility who condemned violence. Two of the people we talked to are veterans.

“Be more like MLK, peaceful, non-aggression is how we get things done here,” said Norman Sowards, a veteran. “I'm down here protesting because Trump is sending the National Guard to police cities when they're only trained one week in a month, two weeks a year. And when I was in Iraq, we were worried that the National Guard were gonna shoot us 'cause they weren't trained well enough.”

“I don't really like to see things like spray-painted or breaking windows. I don't think that that really helps our cause,” said Amanda Cochran, a veteran. ""I felt the need to go out there and lend my voice as a veteran to say that I don't agree with this, and I don't want to see my country become a militarized state, and I don't think that it's appropriate to be sending troops in this isn’t a war zone.”

On Tuesday night, we took video of officers pushing people out of the ICE facility driveway, eventually taking two people into custody.

Some say the nighttime attracts more people to the protests.

“The reason it transitions into more people during the night is largely because that's when people are off work,” said Jack Dickinson, a protester who has been protesting since February.

We asked folks about why they think the environment around the ICE facility gets more tense at nighttime.

“I think you get a lot more people that are out of work and that it's a little bit easier to hide yourself and to escalate things when the sun goes down,” Cochran said.

In a video from June, you can see a man standing outside the ICE facility, and then what appears to be federal officers hitting him from behind.

That video is different from what we've seen at the facility during the day.

Mike Kehoe’s decision to deploy Missouri National Guard soldiers to support immigration enforcement “makes no sense” because they will not get paid until the federal government shutdown is resolved, the state Senate’s Democratic leader said Thursday.

On Tuesday, Kehoe announced that soldiers from the Guard would, on a volunteer basis, be assigned to provide administrative, clerical and logistical support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facilities in the state.

The shutdown started a few hours after Kehoe announced the deployment.

“Everybody knew that was coming, and to me that makes no sense,” Beck said.

Spokeswoman Gabby Picard said that there will be up to 15 soldiers on duty at any particular time until authorization ends on Sept. 30, 2026.

ICE continues to work while most of the government is shut down because the budget bill approved in July funded the agency with $29.9 billion for enforcement and $5 billion for detention through September 2029.

When on federal deployment, members of the Guard are paid on the same schedule as active-duty personnel, with the next pay date being Oct. 15. No active duty military will receive pay until the shutdown is resolved.

The Tuesday news release said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved assigning Guard personnel to ICE facilities on July 25, allowing them to be paid from the federal treasury.

“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts,” Kehoe said in a news release.

While all the soldiers taking on the duty are doing so as volunteers, they expected to get paid, Beck said.

“I’m sure, when they did this, they didn’t know that they’d be doing it possibly for free for a while,” Beck said. “I’m assuming they’ll be made whole at some point, but I’m sure they got bills just like everybody else.”

In response to Beck’s criticism, Picard said the decision to assist ICE wasn’t made hastily.

“Planning for this activation has been ongoing for weeks, and has nothing to do with the unfortunate political games of the Democrats in Washington that have caused a government shutdown,” Picard said.

The deployment has also drawn criticism from labor unions and the ACLU..

Lenny Jones, vice president and state director at the Service Employees International Union-Healthcare, said in a news release that the deployment is part of an increasingly authoritarian government.

“This is just another power grab used to silence and intimidate people who disagree with the administration’s anti-American policies,” Jones said.

The ACLU said the deployment diverts resources from disaster recovery and other needs.

“National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to suit the president’s political whims,” Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division, said in a news release.

The deployment should be unneeded because ICE has been hiring large numbers of new employees, Beck said.

“You tell me they can’t keep up with the paperwork?” Beck asked.

The standoff in Washington is over the health care subsidies for marketplace health plans that are ending under the budget reconciliation bill passed in July. Democrats are demanding they be restored, while Republicans insist the government must be reopened before they will negotiate.

Beck said he wants Democrats in Congress to hold their position.

“At the end of the day, the Republicans control everything, all three branches of the government,” Beck said. “So the question you have to ask yourself is, why did they let it get to this point?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_beck1-2048x1229.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 10:57:21.951145

ICE has increasingly used mega-detention centers run by for-profit prison corporations with the capacity to detain large numbers of people.

Vera’s research reveals what ICE is not sharing with the public and the vast scale and human cost of Trump’s immigration agenda.

Recent reports show that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently holding more than 59,000 people across the United States—a record and unprecedented high.

To imprison such an enormous group of people, ICE has built a massive, nation-spanning network of detention centers. Beyond the notorious stateand federally-run facilities like the South Florida Detention Facility (cruelly referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz”) and the Camp 57 wing of the Louisiana State Penitentiary (commonly known as Angola), the system also includes private prisons and local jails. Many unexpected places, such as hotels, hospitals, airports, and military bases, are also part of the ICE detention network. People detained in these facilities have reported violence, overcrowding, starvation, and medical neglect.

When ICE moves people into its labyrinthine detention system, it shares only limited, often error-prone statistics with the public. Its failure to regularly release accurate, complete, and accessible data is part of what enables it to operate this multi-billion-dollar network with little oversight or accountability.

But this summer, Vera researchers updated our ICE Detention Trends dashboard with newly-available data, providing the general public with the best glimpse yet into the scale of ICE’s detention system. Analyzing millions of new detention history records provided by the Deportation Data Project, the tool provides an unprecedented level of detail about ICE detention populations every day over a 16-year period ending this past June—including a detailed picture of ICE’s detention operations during the first four months of President Trump’s second term.

Here’s what we found.

1. The number of people detained by ICE has reached unprecedented levels.

Recent public ICE reports reveal that 61,226 people were detained on August 23, 2025. Vera’s dashboard shows that the number of people in detention has never reached this level before, even for a single day, during the 16-year period covered by the data.

2. The number of people in detention has increased dramatically since the start of President Trump’s second term.

Vera’s analysis shows that, in the first four-and-a-half months of the second Trump administration, ICE booked people into detention roughly 119,500 times—a 17 percent increase from the same time period during Trump’s first term, and a 46 percent increase from the same period under President Biden (during the COVID-19 pandemic).

3. In early June 2025, ICE was detaining people in 436 facilities—but acknowledged using just 163 of them on its own website.

Vera’s analysis reveals that ICE was using 149 staging facilities and 55 medical facilities in June 2025—places that ICE largely excludes from the statistics it regularly puts out publicly. Among the litigation ICE is currently facing, one case argues that its practice of detaining people in overcrowded holding rooms for prolonged periods of time under inhumane conditions is unlawful and unconstitutional.

4. In June 2025, ICE detained people in facilities across all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; the Northern Mariana Islands; Guam; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The states with the most facilities in Vera’s analysis were Texas (69), Florida (40), and California (27).

5. Since the start of President Trump’s second term, ICE has increasingly used mega-detention centers run by for-profit prison corporations with the capacity to detain large numbers of people.

In early June, 17 facilities across nine states—all of which are operated by private companies—held more than 1,000 people in detention per day. Two of these facilities—Adams County Correctional Center (Natchez, Mississippi) and Stewart Detention Center (Lumpkin, Georgia)—exceeded 2,000 people detained daily. These private companies have financially gained from the Trump administration’s expansion of detention, despite reports of inhumane conditions, overcrowding, and lack of access to counsel.

The following are the 17 facilities that held more than 1,000 people per day:

Eloy Federal Contract Facility (Eloy, Arizona)

Otay Mesa Detention Center (San Diego, California)

Denver Contract Detention Facility (Aurora, Colorado)

Krome North Service Processing Center (Miami, Florida)

Stewart Detention Center (Lumpkin, Georgia)

La Salle ICE Processing Center (Jena, Louisiana)

Jackson Parish Correctional Center (Jonesboro, Louisiana)

Richwood Correctional Center (Monroe, Louisiana)

Winn Correctional Center (Winnfield, Louisiana)

Adams County Correctional Center (Natchez, Mississippi)

Moshannon Valley Processing Center (Philipsburg, Pennsylvania)

Bluebonnet Detention Facility (Anson, Texas)

Karnes County Residential Center (Karnes City, Texas)

Montgomery Processing Center (Conroe, Texas)

Port Isabel Service Processing Center (Los Fresnos, Texas)

South Texas ICE Processing Center (Pearsall, Texas)

Northwest ICE Processing Center (Tacoma, Washington)

6. Local jails were the most common type of detention facility used by ICE over the 16-year period covered by the data.

In addition to using private and federal detention facilities, ICE has a widespread practice of paying local governments to hold people facing civil immigration charges in jails.

7. The Trump administration has revived—and plans to expand—the practice of detaining families with children.

The Biden administration had phased out family detention because of the harm it inflicts on minors. Yet, ICE resumed holding families at two detention facilities in Texas: on June 10, 2025, the Karnes County Residential Center held 1,187 people, and the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley held 575 people. Two more family detention centers are slated to open by year’s end, giving the administration the added capacity to detain 5,500 more people.

8. Since the start of the second Trump term through early June 2025, ICE has detained people in 605 facilities.

By comparison, ICE detained people in 457 facilities in the last quarter of the Biden administration (October 1, 2024, to January 19, 2025).

9. ICE has detained people in 59 new facilities since the second Trump administration began, including 17 federal facilities (two in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba) and 20 medical facilities.

The following are the 10 largest new facilities:

JTF Camp Six (Guantanamo Bay, Cuba)

Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary (Atlanta, Georgia)

Leavenworth U.S. Penitentiary (Leavenworth, Kansas)

Hopkins County Jail (Madisonville, Kentucky)

Campbell County Detention Center (Newport, Kentucky)

Federal Correctional Institution Berlin (Berlin, New Hampshire)

Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio (Stryker, Ohio)

Cimarron Correctional Facility (Cushing, Oklahoma)

Federal Detention Center Philadelphia (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)

El Paso Soft Sided Facility (El Paso, Texas)

10. ICE reopened 77 facilities that it had not been using in the year prior to President Trump’s second inauguration, including 36 non-dedicated facilities and 17 federal facilities.

The 10 largest of these reopened facilities are:

Etowah County Jail (Gadsden, Alabama)

Miami Federal Detention Center (Miami, Florida)

Glades County Detention Center (Moore Haven, Florida)

Marion County Jail (Indianapolis, Indiana)

Greene County Jail (Springfield, Missouri)

Butler County Jail (Hamilton, Ohio)

Northeast Ohio Correctional Center (Youngstown, Ohio)

Mahoning County Jail (Youngstown, Ohio)

Broome County Jail (Binghamton, New York)

Aguadilla Service Processing Center (Aguadilla, Puerto Rico)

The scale and scope of ICE’s detention network, as revealed by Vera’s research, is just a glimpse at the colossal amount of resources the United States has spent on immigration detention and enforcement. And the Trump administration has plans to dramatically expand its scope, recently allocating an unprecedented $45 billion for detention and $30 billion for additional enforcement.

Immigration detention terrorizes communities with no valid justification. Detention does not deter migration, nor is it necessary to ensure that people appear in court for immigration hearings. Yet, in the almost 30 years since the start of the modern era of civil immigration detention in the United States, millions of people, many seeking refuge and opportunity in this country, have had their lives irrevocably harmed by this cruel system. The scale of the problem may be vast, but that does not absolve us of our duty to address it.

“It will turn Ireland’s asylum system into one that prioritises speed and enforcement over fairness and human rights.
“It normalises the erosion of human rights standards against some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.","The Coalition on the EU Migration Pact, composed of 10 civil society organisations, has published an in-depth analysis of the general scheme of the International Protection Bill 2025, which will replace the International Protection Act 2015 and transpose the Pact texts into Irish law.

The coalition has expressed deep concern about the potential impact on people seeking protection in Ireland, and highlighted critical omissions in the government’s proposal on how it intends to proceed on a number of fundamental issues.

The coalition’s concerns include the lack of clarity on whether applicants will retain their basic right to legal counsel; potential severe limits on freedom of movement or widespread use of detention; whether the new accelerated procedure will ensure a fair and just system that accounts for vulnerabilities; and the removal of in-person appeals apart from a small minority of cases.

Nick Henderson, CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, said: “The Irish government is advancing major legislation that will drastically change and affect the rights of people seeking protection, transposing into Irish law more than 1,000 pages of EU Pact texts.

“We have grave concerns about both the content of the bill and the process behind it.

“The heads of bill contain crucial omissions. It is silent on reception conditions, legal counselling and age assessment and removes in-person appeals — crucial pillars of the protection process.

“The bill also fails to transpose key safeguards contained in the Pact texts, and in several areas takes a more restrictive approach where less restrictive options are available.

“The pre-legislative scrutiny process, due to take place in October, will be deficient if significant parts of the bill only emerge later, it will severely undermine meaningful pre-legislative scrutiny.

“We are urging the Department of Justice to publish an updated heads of bills urgently and to meaningfully engage with civil society and other stakeholders, ensuring sufficient time for consultation and feedback.”

Fiona Hurley, CEO of Nasc, the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre in Cork, said: “This legislation marks one of the most significant shifts in asylum law in the history of the State.

“It risks dismantling key human rights protections, including fair procedures and meaningful access to asylum.

“It will turn Ireland’s asylum system into one that prioritises speed and enforcement over fairness and human rights.

Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.
""We are fighting for the health care of the American people.""","One of the main lines of attack the White House and Republican lawmakers have leveled against Democrats amid the government shutdown is the claim that Democratic lawmakers want to give immigrants in the U.S. illegally free health care — which Democrats deny.

""Democrats are holding the American government HOSTAGE so they can give FREE health care to ILLEGAL ALIENS,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said on social media Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of wanting to ""take from the American people in order to give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants.""

Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have pointed to a provision in the Democrats' funding proposal that would reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's measures narrowing Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. The changes sought by Democrats would only extend Medicaid coverage to immigrants with some kind of legal status or government protection.

Before the bill passed earlier this year, U.S. law allowed several classes of immigrants living in the U.S. legally or with the government's permission to apply for and get Medicaid, if they met other requirements.

Those groups included lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally, people granted a humanitarian benefit known as ""parole"" to enter the country, refugees, immigrants who won asylum and others, including those who were issued deportation reprieves by a judge.

Some people in those groups may have crossed into the U.S. illegally but were later granted legal status, like asylum, or deportation deferrals by immigration judges.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act — passed by lawmakers and signed by President Trump over the summer — significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid coverage, making it only accessible to lawful permanent residents, Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally and noncitizens from several Pacific islands.

The bill excluded those granted parole to enter the U.S., refugees, asylees and the other previously eligible immigrants. Roughly 1.4 million immigrants could lose health insurance coverage under the bill's provisions, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.

The Democrats' funding proposal would restore noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid to the longstanding pre-2025 rules, reopening access for the classes of immigrants who were carved out earlier this year. All of those immigrants are in the U.S. either legally or with the government's permission.

U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally — without any type of legal status — ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.

Trump administration officials, however, have argued that some of the lawfully present immigrants previously eligible for Medicaid were illegally let in by the Biden administration. They argue that in the case of those granted parole, the Biden administration waved them in using a ""magic wand,"" in violation of federal immigration law.

The groups of people granted parole under former President Biden — such as Venezuelans and Ukrainians — entered the country with the government's permission and were authorized to work and live in the U.S. The Trump administration has suspended those Biden-era parole programs, and revoked the legal status of many of those who arrived under them.

The legal status of many of the other immigrants eligible for Medicaid before the One Big Beautiful Bill act — like the refugees and asylees — is not disputed. Both refugees and asylees are on a path to permanent legal status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship.

While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status. Emergency funding for noncitizens constitutes less than 1% of total spending for the program, according to an analysis by KFF. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the amount hospitals can receive for these ER visits, which the Democrats' government funding plan would reverse.

Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The position of most Democrats is that they will not vote for a short-term funding extension that would allow the government to reopen unless Republicans extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that have helped millions of Americans lower their health insurance costs.

""Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. ""We are fighting for the health care of the American people.""

Some Republicans have also argued that if Democrats restore the federal Medicaid funding that was cut in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it would allow Democratic-led states to spend more state funds on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully.

According to an analysis by nonpartisan health care researchers at KFF, more than a dozen states comprehensively cover care for low-income children who lack a legal immigration status using state funds. Some states, including California, provide some form of coverage to adults living in the country without authorization.

Republicans previously attempted to penalize these states in Mr. Trump's budget bill, but that provision did not make it into the final legislation.

Democrats say that’s a lie.

Like most things dealing with policy and politics. It’s complicated.

Claim: Democrats want to provide health care for “illegal” immigrants

One of the Democrats’ asks before they help reopen the government is to roll back the health care section from the One Big Beautiful Bill. Republicans have pointed out that means undoing the “Alien Medicaid Eligibility” and “Expansion FMAP for Emergency Medicaid.”

To be clear, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, but some lawfully present immigrants do qualify if they meet eligibility requirements. But the keyword there is lawfully.

First, Republicans point to the Alien Medicaid Eligibility section as an example of Democrats wanting to give “illegals” health care. (Alien is how the federal government describes noncitizens.)

What the OBBB did was limit what types of public benefits — like health care — lawfully present qualified alien (defined under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) could get access to, if they meet certain requirements, like having been in the U.S. for five years. The OBBB kept it for Legal Permanent Residents, certain Cuban and Haitian immigrants and Citizens of the Freely Associated States (COFA) migrants present lawfully in the U.S., but cut it for other lawfully present aliens, such as refugees, aliens granted parole for at least a year, and some victims of abuse or trafficking.

Nowhere in any Democratic proposal have they suggested that they want to extend such coverage to undocumented immigrants.

“All of these folks have to have a lawful immigration status. And a whole lot of people with lawful immigration statuses are already barred from accessing Medicaid,” said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. “It is a false statement to say that people who were undocumented previously enrolled and were eligible for any of these programs that were narrowed and very, very much restricted.”

Where it gets murky is who was granted parole. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday said the Biden Administration abused the parole program when it granted parole status to “millions” who crossed the border illegally. “That was an outrageous violation of the existing federal law and of the principles of good stewardship,” he said at a press conference. There’s a case making its way through the courts now that will decide that question when it comes to some parolees the Trump administration is trying to strip of that lawful status.

Still, if the court decides to revoke parole, the immigrants would be ineligible for the program, which gives benefits like health care to some lawfully present immigrants.

The second issue is emergency Medicaid. This program reimburses hospitals for emergency medical care for people who don’t qualify for full Medicaid, often due to their immigration status. It’s for treatment for possible loss of life, limb or serious impairment of bodily functions. A 1986 federal law, signed by President Ronald Regan, requires emergency rooms to treat patients in an emergency regardless of their ability to pay or, in this case, immigration status.

So yes, in this circumstance, undocumented immigrants receive health care, and hospitals get paid for their treatment.

The OBBB reduced funding for the emergency Medicaid program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, that cut is estimated to save $28 billion over 10 years. KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, reports that in FY2023, $3.8 billion was spent on emergency Medicaid — that was about 0.4 percent of total Medicaid spending that year.

Claim: By wanting to repeal the health care portion of OBBB, Democrats are getting rid of the Rural Hospital Fund

The Rural Hospital fund, which provides $50 billion over 5 years to states, was created by the OBBB. Half of it must be evenly divided between the states, while the other half is up to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to distribute.

So yes, getting rid of the health care portion of OBBB would get rid of the fund.

But you have to keep in mind, the fund was created to offset the OBBB’s Medicaid cuts, which was expected to hit rural hospitals hard. According to KFF, the fund will cover just under 40 percent of the estimated loss of federal Medicaid funding in rural areas from the OBBB.

“The whole purpose of the fund was to give cover to the fact that [OBBB is] cutting $1 trillion in Medicaid,” said Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist for the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities. “The biggest rural thing was Medicaid.”

Also, the way the fund has been set up, the money will go to states, not to rural hospitals directly.

In the end, it’s unlikely that Republicans will roll back part of their signature bill, especially the portion that helps pay for the tax cuts in the OBBB.

That leads to the Democrats’ other health care ask: extending the pandemic-era enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credit.

Claim: There’s time to act on this ACA subsidy

The ACA enhanced premium tax credits were introduced in 2021 and later extended to the end of the year. It helps people buy health insurance on the state exchanges and more than doubled the amount of people who bought health coverage from 11 million to over 24 million nationwide. In Colorado, about 100,000 more people got their insurance with the help of the credit. The added enrollment also happened because it expanded eligibility to include those with incomes 400 percent above the poverty line. For a family of four, 400 percent above the federal poverty line is nearly $125,000 annually.

Republicans argue that the credit expires at the end of the year, and there is time to negotiate. That is true.

However, open enrollment starts on November 1, and information on the higher amount people will have to pay will soon be released. The increase in prices are expected to cause sticker shock, and Democrats say many people will not be able to afford health coverage on the marketplaces as a result. This is why Democrats argue a fix needs to happen now. Many people will be making decisions on whether they can afford the higher prices soon, not sometime after November 21, the day the Republican's short term funding measure would run through.

Colorado and many other states have enrollment that goes through January 15, 2026. So if there are negotiations on an extension of the credit, people can still get coverage, in theory, with the tax credits intact. But coverage for them would not start until February 1. For people who want coverage to begin on January 1, they need to enroll by December 15.

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the tax credit. But again, some noncitizens who are lawfully present, like lawful permanent residents, are eligible. And to get the tax credit, they have to file taxes.

Some Republicans point to a Congressional Budget Office letter on the OBBB, noting that 1.2 million noncitizens would lose coverage as evidence that undocumented immigrants were getting the credit. But that analysis was in relation to the new restrictions on immigrant health coverage in the OBBB, the winnowing of the eligible lawfully present noncitizens (900,000 people losing coverage), and a ban on low-income lawful permanent residents getting ACA marketplace subsidies while in a 5-year Medicaid waiting period (about 300,000 people losing coverage).

Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Darian Maldonado Medina, 28, during a routine check-in at an immigration office in Tampa on Sept. 5. When he entered the U.S. through the Mexican border in June 2021 authorities determined he did not prove a credible fear of returning to Venezuela and issued him an expedited removal order. He was released into the United States under ICE’s supervision and received TPS in 2023. He also had a pending family petition through his U.S. citizen mother, the beginning of the green-card process.

The same day Maldonado Medina was detained, federal judge Edward Chen upheld President Joe Biden’s administration’s extension of TPS for over half-a-million Venezuelans, including Maldonado Medina, after the Supreme Court in May let the Trump administration end the protections while litigation was ongoing.

Maldonado Medina re-registered for TPS as recently as May, meeting the required deadlines. Even with a pending renewal, lawyers emphasized that beneficiaries are protected from deportation in the interim. Still, ICE did not release him following the judge’s ruling and instead deported him to Venezuela just weeks later.

“They said TPS didn’t cover anything, that it didn’t work, and that I should just sign,” Maldonado Medina said from Valencia, Venezuela, during a phone interview with the Miami Herald.

The Department of Homeland Security told the Herald in a statement that “his TPS had ended in April 2025.” DHS did not respond to follow-up questions about why it proceeded with Maldonado Medina’s removal after Chen’s order was issued.

“TPS was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades. Secretary [Kristi] Noem is returning TPS to its original intent—TEMPORARY,” said a Homeland Security spokesperson.

But lawyers told the Herald that the deportation of Maldonado Medina was illegal and that the federal law that created Temporary Protected Status explicitly protects immigrants from being removed while the designation is in effect. They say his case highlights troubling inconsistencies in how the DHS is enforcing TPS protections.

“TPS holders should be, by law, protected from deportation. TPS protects individuals from detention and deportation during the period that the status is valid,” said Emi MacLean, one of the attorneys representing Venezuelans in the lawsuit against the Trump administration decision to terminate TPS. She described the deportation as “egregious” and accused Homeland Security of violating the federal judge’s orders.

“TPS provides protections against detention and deportation. Yet many Venezuelan TPS holders continue to be detained illegally,” MacLean said.

Hundreds of Venezuelan TPS holders remain in detention, particularly in Texas, where more than 50 people are still being held. Oklahoma is another state where individuals have yet to be released, the Herald reported last week after speaking with family members of 30 detainees in ICE facilities across the country.

Recently, dozens of TPS holders have been released after months in custody in states like Florida, Georgia, California, New Jersey, New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The releases followed efforts by attorneys from the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, along with the Venezuelan American Caucus, an advocacy group, which submitted documentation in support of at least 400 cases nationwide. The legal experts are part of the team representing Venezuelan TPS holders in the ongoing lawsuit against the federal government.

‘Extremely disappointed’

Before ICE picked him up, Maldonado Medina had been living for the past four years in Spring Hill in Hernando County. He worked as a roofer and was the primary breadwinner for his partner and son. He told the Herald that during his detention, ICE agents repeatedly pressured him to sign a voluntary deportation order even after he said he had TPS.

Maldonado Medina was scheduled to be deported on Sept. 24, but a series of earthquakes in Venezuela forced the flight to divert to Aruba for several hours before returning to Miami. He was held for 48 hours at Alligator Alcatraz, the state detention site in the Eveglades, which he described as “a birdcage” with no shower, with open toilets and bunk beds.

“They never told me they were going to deport me. I realized I was going to be deported when we were flying,” Maldonado Medinda said. “They just kept stalling me.”

Nearly a week after his deportation, the ICE online locator continues to show him as being held in El Paso. “I’m glad they released me because being in detention was awful. But I’m extremely disappointed in what they did to me,” he told the Herald.

Some lawyers said that the federal government could argue Maldonado Medina’s deportation was legal because Judge Chen’s order did not grant the pending petitions under TPS, and that because he had a pending TPS petition and a removal order, they could deport him since his TPS was not active. However, the law confers deportation protection on TPS beneficiaries with pending renewals, and other lawyers said that having an expedited removal order was not grounds to deport him because he was a TPS beneficiary.

“There are already tons of people who have removal orders with TPS. You can’t be deported. You can’t be removed,“ said Randy McGrorty, director of Miami-Based Catholic Legal Services. “TPS protects you notwithstanding the removal order.”

On Sept. 15, ten days after Maldonado Medina’s arrest, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services updated its website to reflect the federal court’s decision, confirming TPS was extended through Oct. 2, 2026. The notice also affirmed that Employment Authorization Documents were automatically extended through April 3, 2026, pending further litigation.

To receive and maintain TPS, beneficiaries must pass background checks. Public records indicate that Maldonado Medina was listed as having a hold by ICE in Pinellas County, titled as a felony on the same day he was arrested by ICE, but no charges were filed.

When the Herald contacted the Pinellas County Court Clerk’s Office, officials said they found no charges against him and referred the inquiry to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. That office also found no public records for Maldonado Medina.

A conviction for one felony or two misdemeanors, regardless of the type of offense, automatically disqualifies an individual from being eligible for TPS.

Records show Maldonado Medina did have traffic citations in Pinellas County in 2022 and 2023 for driving without a valid driving license and speeding. A search of Hillsborough County Clerk records, where Tampa is located and where ICE arrested him, shows no felony charges. The only record under his name in Hillsborough is from 2024, a traffic citation for failing to stop at a red light.

No future in the U.S. for now

After being deported, Maldonado Medina is now subject to a five-year bar from the United States. If he were to try to re-enter through the Mexican border sought asylum, he would need to claim persecution in Venezuela and establish a well-founded fear of returning.

The roofer planned to build a life in the United States, to raise his family and work toward stability.

“I wanted to live there forever, but I feel disappointed about what happened to me,” he said. “If I ever have the chance to return legally, without problems, I would absolutely.”

His deportation left his family shattered — a 15-month-old U.S. citizen son and a partner who remain in Florida and are now struggling to get by. He was the family’s sole breadwinner, and now they’re left trying to figure out if, and when, they might be together again.

“I am holding onto the hope that he will come back,” said Valentina Veloz, Maldonado Medina’s partner, who was waiting for him during his check-in at the ICE office in Tampa. The day he was arrested was also their anniversary. The couple has been together for more than eight years and share a son, Ivar Alejandro.

Veloz said they were building a future in the U.S., planning to buy a home next year and create a stable life for their family.

“Our plan was to build a life here, have a baby, find stable jobs, and live peacefully.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/f8i6yh/picture312358909/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Daria_Crop.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 08:56:39.359450

On 3 June 2024 his claim was refused both on asylum and human rights grounds.
Here, however, the claim made is no longer a protection claim – it is solely that the petitioner’s Article 8 rights would be infringed.
On that basis I conclude that it cannot be said that his claim is “clearly unfounded” The claim succeeded.","A gay man from India has successfully challenged a decision by the Home Secretary to certify his human rights claim, meaning that he was unable to appeal the refusal. He will now be able to appeal the refusal of his human rights claim to the tribunal. This is a Scottish case, Petition of SV for Judicial Review (Court of Session) [2025] CSOH 88.

Background

The petitioner (claimant) is an Indian national who entered the UK as a student and then claimed asylum in December 2023 based on his sexual orientation. On 3 June 2024 his claim was refused both on asylum and human rights grounds. The claims were certified as “clearly unfounded” under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, meaning that the decision could not be appealed.

The petitioner sought judicial review of the certification decision relating to article 8 only.

The court referred to the relevant authorities including ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] UKHL 6 and SN v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] CSIH 7. The test for a claim being clearly unfounded is that it is bound to fail on appeal. If there is a realistic chance that the appeal may succeed in the tribunal then it is not clearly unfounded. This is a low test given the decision to certify removes a person’s right to appeal to the tribunal.

Given the challenge was on article 8 grounds only, the issue to be decided was whether there would be very significant obstacles to SV’s integration into India if he was returned there. The court referred to the Home Office’s guidance on private life claims which states:

A very significant obstacle may arise where the applicant would be at a real risk of prosecution or significant harassment or discrimination as a result of their sexual or political orientation or faith or gender, or where their rights and freedoms would otherwise be so severely restricted as to affect their fundamental rights, and therefore their ability to establish a private life in that country.

It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the fact that he “may be required to hide or minimise his sexual orientation while in India might be considered to represent a very significant obstacle” to his reintegration into India.

The Home Secretary relied on the country guidance case of MD (same-sex oriented males: risk) India CG [2014] UKUT 65 (IAC) and said there was no basis to depart from the country guidance. The court quoted at length from the country guidance case, which says that internal relocation within India would not be unduly harsh and that there are LGBT+ networks in India.

The decision in MD also states that violence and extortion of gay men still happened in India, that being gay is seen as socially unacceptable and that there is discrimination in employment, housing and access to healthcare. This guidance was given in the context of an asylum claim and there was no consideration in that case of obstacles to reintegration, where these factors, while not meeting the threshold for persecution, may still be relevant.

It was noted on behalf of SV that conditions that do not breach article 3 may still breach article 8 and argued that:

The respondent has failed to consider parts of the CPIN and did not consider how discrimination and stigma that he would face might affect his private life or ability to reintegrate. The fact that the petitioner may be required to hide or minimise his sexual orientation while in India might be considered to represent a very significant obstacle to the petitioner’s reintegration into India.

The court agreed, finding:

The decision in MD is to the effect that it cannot be said that the threshold for a protection claim is met. Here, however, the claim made is no longer a protection claim – it is solely that the petitioner’s Article 8 rights would be infringed. I do not consider it is necessary to go behind or disregard what he said in MD to reach a conclusion that a Tribunal in future might reach a conclusion that the petitioner’s sexuality means he would be unable to integrate. Paragraph 174(c) of that decision quoted above indicates a number of forms of treatment which might arise and which, if they did, might present a very significant obstacle to integration. I accept entirely that there are arguments to be made to the contrary, but the dispute between these positions is not for me to resolve in this action. Having regard to the material put before me, I consider that it cannot be said that there is no possibility that a Tribunal would accept that, on return to India, the petitioner would face very significant obstacles to reintegration and decide in his favour. On that basis I conclude that it cannot be said that his claim is “clearly unfounded”

The claim succeeded.

Conclusion

The most recently reported statistics on asylum claims based on sexual orientation (for 2023, published in August 2024) indicate that there have been grants of asylum to Indian nationals as recently as 2021 and 2023, albeit in such small numbers that the exact figure is not reported. The figures also show appeals being allowed in these claims in every year they are reported, although again in very small numbers. In light of this and the country guidance that she sought to rely on, I think it does make the Home Secretary’s arguments in favour of certification, particularly on article 8 grounds as here, difficult.

Success in this case does not of course equal success overall, as SV will now also need to succeed in his immigration appeal if he is to be granted leave to stay in the UK.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/case-law-677940_1280-edited.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:57:09.755304

This content does not constitute news reporting by Polity.org.za.

The South African Communist Party (SACP) strongly condemns the recent actions of anti-immigrant vigilante groups, such as Operation Dudula. These groups have targeted migrants and undocumented South Africans mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, denying them access to essential public services and turning them away from government clinics and hospitals. This has often been done by using abusive and violent tactics. These actions, conducted with impunity, are not only inhumane but also unlawful, violating the constitutional and legal rights of all people in South Africa and undermine the principles of justice and equality enshrined in our Constitution.

Section 27(1)(a) of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996, guarantees everyone the right to access healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare. The National Health Act 61 of 2003 further reinforces that no one may be refused emergency medical treatment, regardless of nationality or documentation status. Vigilante groups claiming to distinguish between emergency and non-emergency cases lack the qualifications or authority to make such determinations or to instruct healthcare workers on patient care. Such actions undermine the rule of law and endanger public health by fostering fear, preventing people from seeking treatment, and increasing the risk of untreated communicable diseases in working-class communities.

This campaign of division has now extended beyond healthcare facilities to public schools, where children are being harassed and intimidated, and workplaces, where workers face demands to leave their jobs. These actions deepen the challenges faced by the working class, exacerbating unemployment and restricting access to education and healthcare. They sow division among workers at a time when unity is critical to address systemic inequalities.

The SACP acknowledges the widespread frustration among the working class and poor, who rely on under-resourced and understaffed public health and education systems that fail to meet their needs. This frustration is compounded by rising insecurity, inadequate policing, and poor border management practices, which have led to an increase in undocumented individuals. The failure of the Department of Home Affairs to efficiently process documentation and capture biometrics has fueled insecurity and provided fertile ground for vigilante groups like Operation Dudula and March & March to gain support among communities desperate for solutions.

The SACP 5th Special National Congress adopted a resolution on immigration, recognising the rise of xenophobia and its corrosive impact on working-class solidarity. The resolution commits the SACP to combat xenophobia, challenge misconceptions propagated by reactionary forces, and advocate for policies that address the root causes of migration. As communists, we remain unwavering in our commitment to international worker solidarity and the protection of the human and labour rights of all workers, their families, and communities, irrespective of citizenship or migration status.

We call on the Department of Home Affairs to urgently implement a comprehensive programme to document and capture the biometrics of all undocumented South Africans and non-South Africans, including those whose documentation has expired due to systemic inefficiencies. Populist vigilantism, reminiscent of apartheid-era practices such as public harassment and demands for identity documents, is not a solution. It only deepens division and distracts from the real issues of systemic inequality and poor governance.

The SACP supports the Minister of Health’s clear stance that preventing access to healthcare is unlawful and inhumane. We also stand in solidarity with the positions of progressive organisations like COSAS and education authorities that have condemned disruptions to teaching and learning caused by vigilante actions. The SACP remains committed to upholding the human rights of all, particularly the most vulnerable, in a society where the rule of law prevails for the benefit of everyone.

The justifiable frustrations of the working class must not be manipulated to target vulnerable workers but should instead be directed at policymakers who prioritise the interests of the private sector and the capitalist class. The SACP will mobilise alongside allied working-class organisations of the left and other progressive forces for national mass action, including marches to the Department of Home Affairs, to demand urgent and effective action on documentation and broader systemic failures.

The SACP calls for unity among the working class to confront these challenges collectively, reject vigilantism and xenophobia, and build a society rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants — regardless of status — have been pulling back.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally “Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what’s happening to immigrants,” she said.
A 2001 court case, Aliessa v. Novello, requires the state to offer publicly funded health coverage to all lawfully present residents under the state constitution.","An estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are in the country legally but are not citizens stand to lose their government-subsidized health care coverage under the sweeping tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.

But seven states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington — plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.

The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

Health care would be slashed even for immigrants with legal status under massive Senate bill

“We’re taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,” said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

“And the result will be that our health — individually, as families and as communities — will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,” Broder said.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants — regardless of status — have been pulling back.

To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.

Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.

New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.

“States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,” said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants’ access to health care. “But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.”

Making it less attractive to stay

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump’s larger anti-immigration stance and “Congress’ interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.”

“It’s a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?” Vaughan said. “They’re trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.”

As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is “likely to increase,” Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.

“However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,” Pillai said. “So it’s almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.”

Makhlouf said the Trump administration’s policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.

‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

“Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what’s happening to immigrants,” she said. “When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people’s humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ‘You don’t deserve access to health care,’ then that can be turned on to any group.”

Under Trump’s domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom’s office.

On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state’s decision to deny coverage to immigrants.

“I can’t express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,” Durazo said. “Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.”

Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.

“We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,” McGuire said during the debate. “So we’ve had to make some tough decisions. I know we’re not going to please everyone.”

Obligated in New York

One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.

Roxana, 27, has been living in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, since she was 8 years old and is using her first name only out of fear she will be targeted. At the end of 2019, she experienced a range of debilitating symptoms, including pelvic pain and chronic fatigue, and discovered a noncancerous lump on her breast.

“Chronic illness has impacted my career trajectory with a lot of fatigue and chronic pain,” said Roxana, who lives in the Bronx, New York.

Roxana cannot get federally funded Medicaid. But she qualified for state-funded public health coverage in New York. A 2001 court case, Aliessa v. Novello, requires the state to offer publicly funded health coverage to all lawfully present residents under the state constitution. So, she could afford to go to the doctor, where she learned that she had a hormonal condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and she was able to get the lump removed.

Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost — 90% — of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.

Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump’s law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state’s Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.

“These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York’s delivery system,” Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.

It’s unclear whether and how the state will afford to cover people like Roxana, even though it’s required under the state’s constitution. Like other immigrants, she is terrified that in the face of cuts and shrinking safety net access for noncitizens, she will lose continuous health care coverage and that her condition will get worse.

“My PCOS symptoms have just been getting worse over the years. I really want to try my best with the health access that I have to get it under control.”

Most prominently, ICEBlock, a free app with hundreds of thousands of users, was no longer available as of Thursday evening to download on the App Store. ICEBlock allows people to anonymously share the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents within a five-mile radius, and its creators had recommended the App Store as the only safe venue from which to download and use it.

In a statement, Apple said it had taken down ICEBlock, and other similar apps, after being contacted by “law enforcement,” but it did not specify which agency or agencies had contacted it and did not say which other apps it had removed. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump administration officials have issued several legal threats over the use of ICEBlock — or even simply reporting on it. Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, said in July that the Justice Department was investigating whether it could prosecute CNN for reporting on the app’s existence, arguing that it amounted to “actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities.” It is unclear what crime that would amount to.

Pam Bondi, the attorney general, also said the Justice Department was “looking at” Joshua Aaron, the creator of the app, adding that “he better watch out.”

In response to the threats, Mr. Aaron defended ICEBlock in an appearance on MSNBC, saying that the service fell under free speech protections and that there was nothing illegal about creating or using the app. He likened the app to Waze and other navigation apps that allow users to alert others to the presence of the police on the road.

“I think whenever you push back against a regime that is purporting authoritarianism, pushing fascism and subverting the rule of law in our Constitution,” Mr. Aaron said in July, “if you push back against them, you have to know they’re going to come after you in some way.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/02dc-ICEBlock-gztq/02dc-ICEBlock-gztq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 06:59:17.341700

(WTVO) — The Department of Homeland Security provided an update to its ongoing “Operation Midway Blitz” on Wednesday, saying over 800 criminal illegal aliens have been arrested despite both the state’s sanctuary policies and violent protests.

According to DHS, “Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving crash by Julio Cucul-Bol, and specifically targets criminals who flocked to Chicago and Illinois seeking protection from deportation by the sanctuary policies of Gov. JB Pritzker.

“During Operation Midway Blitz, DHS law enforcement has made more than 800 arrests across Illinois. The Trump Administration will not allow violent criminals or repeat offenders to terrorize our neighborhoods or victimize our children and innocent Americans,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “We will not allow sanctuary politicians or violent rioters to stop us from enforcing the law and arresting pedophiles, murderers, gang members, rapists, and domestic abusers from American communities.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol provided examples of recent arrests, including:

Cristobal Carias Masin, of El Salvador, convicted of statutory rape, fraud, and aggravated felony.

Stefan Cseve, of Austria, convicted of sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, numerous sexual predator in a public park offenses, child sex offender loitering, in violation of the sex offender registry and currently charged with murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor.

In response to the large-scale ICE operation, protesters have targeted a federal facility in Broadview, chanting “shoot ICE” and confronting agents.

On Friday, agents repeatedly fired chemical agents toward a crowd of over 100 protesters after some of the group attempted to block a car from driving down a street toward the ICE building. Pepper bullets and tear gas canisters went into the crowd, most of them standing away from the fence and not blocking traffic.

CBS News Chicago and the Broadview Police Department have launched an investigation after a reporter’s car was struck by a chemical munition outside the facility.

Illinois effectively banned immigration detention in 2021, when it ended local cooperation agreements between the federal government and county jails. Illinois barred private detention in 2019 following failed attempts to build a new detention facility and there are no federal immigration detention centers in the state.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker countered by saying,“We have received many reports of US citizens being detained for simply stepping onto the public streets,” adding that “sixty percent of the individuals that ICE has taken in Illinois this year have no criminal convictions of any kind.”

In Chicago on Sunday, dozens of armed federal agents, in full tactical gear, walked the streets of some of the city’s most prominent tourist and shopping areas.

Pritzker has maintained that current ICE operations are a provocation, hoping to enflame a violent response so that President Donald Trump can send the military to Chicago, under the pretext of supporting federal agents.

“In any other country, if federal agents fired upon journalists and protesters unprovoked, what would we call it?” Pritzker asked Monday. “If federal agents march down busy streets, harassing civilians and demanding their papers, what would we say? I don’t think we’d have any trouble calling it what it is: authoritarianism.”

Roughly 100 Army Reserve lawyers are expected to participate, with 50 beginning a nearly six-month assignment immediately after their training, according to a Sept. 3 email sent to an Army Reserve attorney and reviewed by The Associated Press.

Training for the first group of Army lawyers begins Monday and training for the second group is expected to start in the spring, several former and current military reserve lawyers said they were told. Roughly 100 Army Reserve lawyers are expected to participate, with 50 beginning a nearly six-month assignment immediately after their training, according to a Sept. 3 email sent to an Army Reserve attorney and reviewed by The Associated Press.

The administration wants to bring in as many as 600 military-trained attorneys to help make decisions about which immigrants can stay in the country. Advocates are alarmed by the move to use military lawyers to bolster staffing in the backlogged immigration courts as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration arrests.

Those courts have yearslong waits for hearings, and the number of pending cases has more than doubled in the past four years to 3.4 million.

Both the Army and National Guard said they hope to fill the assignments with volunteers.

“This assignment provides the opportunity to gain judicial experience in a high tempo, nationally significant setting,” an email sent to members of the Army’s Reserve Legal Command stated, adding that locations and other details will be released later.

A notification seeking volunteers sent Sept. 6 to active-duty and reserve National Guard members said “ideal candidates will possess experience in administrative law, immigration law, service as a military judge” or a related field. Applicants should have sound judgment, impartiality and a “suitable temperament for the role,” it said.

The Trump administration increasingly has turned to the military to support its crackdown on illegal immigration. That has included troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases, and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.

Concerns over lack of training

Immigration judges each manage hundreds or thousands of cases, deciding who gets asylum and green cards to stay in the U.S. Their rulings shape both the lives of immigrant families and the success of Trump’s crackdown.

Some immigration and military law experts are concerned the reservists will be put in the job without enough training or experience after more than 100 immigration judges were fired or left.

With only about 600 immigration judges remaining, the Pentagon move would double their ranks. Trump’s sweeping new tax and spending law provided $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including the hiring of 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees, but it caps the number of permanent immigration judges at 800.

“They’re letting a lot of experienced judges go, terminating them with no notice, and yet they claim that there’s a shortage so they need to have these military JAG officers step in and take over,” said Margaret Stock, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and immigration lawyer.

Of particular concern, the administration is not requiring experience as an administrative law judge or in immigration law as in the past, she said. Stock has taught seminars on immigration law at West Point but said military lawyers learn only a minimal amount to be able to help fellow service members with things like visas for spouses or children.

“Immigration law is super technical and complicated,” she said. “It’s worse than tax law, and it’s constantly changing. And it has its own terminology, its own rules that don’t make any sense.”

Immigration judges come from a range of legal backgrounds, including the military, the Justice Department, immigration enforcement agencies, and private practice. The government previously required applicants to have seven years' experience before undergoing a lengthy hiring process, then six weeks of training followed by a two-year probation period.

Until now, temporary judges needed 10 years of legal experience in immigration, and were often retired immigration judges, according to the government's rule laying out the new plan.

The Defense Department did not return an email seeking comment. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the immigration courts, declined to comment. In the rule, the agency wrote that many successful immigration judges had little experience in immigration law before taking the job.

“Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success,” the rule said.

In the military, an attorney is known as a judge advocate general, or JAG. They study at accredited law schools and pass the bar exam before going into a military law program for just over two months. They sometimes work as special assistants to U.S. attorneys and gather evidence to prosecute criminal cases, much like civilian prosecutors do, said Mark Nevitt, a former Navy JAG and associate professor at Emory University School of Law.

“They are some of the greatest lawyers you’ll meet in the national security world,” but this will require they “get up to speed pretty quickly on a complex body of law and then adjudicate matters and claims as a judge,” Nevitt said.

Matt Biggs, president of a federal employee union that represents immigration judges, said tapping lawyers with little or no immigration experience to hear these complex, high-stakes cases will likely do more harm than good.

“It will lead to more appeals of decisions. It will further increase the backlog. It’s going to be an inefficient and costly endeavor,” Biggs said. “It sets a dangerous precedent in this country when it comes to due process protections.”

Gregory Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said the Justice Department is “watering down the qualifications of those it will empower to make life-or-death decisions.”

He also worries the administration will hold too much sway over the temporary hires. The permanent judges are government employees with civil service protections.

Democrats have questioned the plan's legality

Some Democratic senators have warned the Pentagon plan may violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which bans service members from carrying out law enforcement duties, and fear taking away the JAGs could harm the military justice system. They sent a letter to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services, asking where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and what legal analysis the military has conducted.

A Pentagon memo describing the plan said the appointments should be for no longer than six months. The memo also said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring the military lawyers don't violate the Posse Comitatus Act.

If the military lawyers serve entirely under civilian personnel then it could be legal, Nevitt said, but it's unclear.

Some immigrant advocates believe the administration is presuming military lawyers are more likely to deny cases to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

But Greg Rinckey, a former Army lawyer who is now in private practice, said that assumption is wrong.

“They will not rubber stamp because most of us have served as defense counsel,” he said. “We’re not all government hacks.”

A number of his friends who are Army Reserve JAGs have signed up because they are interested in immigration law and want to serve a national need, he said.

“And also it’s a way to put something else on your resume — that you served as a judge.”

In recent months, the Trump administration made deals with a number of third states to receive deported non-citizens.

In Australia, the Labor government has similarly established new powers to deport non-citizens to third states. The government signed a secretive deal with Nauru in September, guaranteeing the small Micronesian island A$2.5 billion over the next three decades to accommodate the first cohort of deportees.

In both countries, migrants can now be banished to states to which they have no prior connection.

Last year in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour party promised that the previous Conservative government’s plan to deport people to Rwanda was “dead and buried”. Yet, Labour removed close to 35,000 people in 2024, an increase of 25% over the previous year.

Starmer has also proposed establishing “return hubs” in third countries for people with rejected asylum claims.

Meanwhile, the far-right Reform Party has put forward a “mass deportation” plan involving the use of military bases to detain and deport hundreds of thousands of people, if it wins power in the next general election.

Similar policies may soon come to Europe, too. In May, the European Commission published a proposal that would allow EU member states to deport people seeking asylum to third countries where they have no previous connection.

The deportation of populations deemed problematic is not a new practice. For centuries, states have used forms of deportation to forcibly remove people, as Australia’s own history as a British penal colony illustrates.

Today, deportations are a staple of migration governance around the world. However, the recent expansion of detention and deportations reflects an accelerated criminalisation and punishment of non-citizens, tied to a rising authoritarianism across purportedly liberal Western countries.

Criminalising movement

The expansion and outsourcing of deportation is underpinned by long histories of criminalising migration.

Over the past three decades, legal obstacles and securitised borders have increasingly forced those fleeing war, persecution and insecurity to rely on unauthorised routes to seek refuge.

Governments have simultaneously reframed the act of seeking asylum from a human right to a criminal act, brandishing those on the move as “illegal” as a way of justifying onshore and offshore immigration detention.

Racialised people living in the community have also been subject to increased policing, regardless of their migration status.

In the US, UK and Australia, this criminalising language, once the preserve of the right-wing press, is now echoed by politicians across the political spectrum and enshrined in legislation. This has accelerated what migration expert Alison Mountz has termed “the death of asylum”, and normalising deportations.

In Australia, for example, the government lowered the threshold for visa cancellations in 2014, resulting in people with minor offences being detained and scheduled for deportation. Those who could not be returned to their home countries continued to languish in detention until a 2023 high court ruling mandated their release.

Despite having served their sentences, in addition to protracted periods in immigration detention, a media frenzy framed these people as a major threat to the community. The Labor government then legislated to deport them, in addition to thousands of others on precarious visas, to a third country.

Deportations have also been a central facet of US immigration enforcement for many years.

Former President Barack Obama was branded “Deporter in Chief” for achieving a record three million deportations while in office.

While Obama focused on “felons not families”, Trump has equated migration itself with crime and insecurity. His administration has cast a much wider net, rounding up those with and without criminal convictions, including citizens.

Detentions and deportations have also been used to suppress political dissent on issues, such as the genocide in Gaza.

To expedite his pledge to deport one million people in his first year, the Trump administration hastily set up detention centres in former prisons and military bases, including at Guantánamo Bay.

Reports suggest the government has also approached 58 third countries to accept deported non-nationals. Countries that have agreed, or already received people, are shown in the map below.

In many cases, people are then re-detained on arrival in hotels, prisons and camps, with some subject to further deportation.

Rising authoritarianism

These recent developments reveal an explicit authoritarianism in which deportations are achieved through the elimination of procedural fairness. Reducing notice periods, the ability to appeal decisions, and access to legal counsel allows for rushed and opaque procedures.

In June, eight people were deported from the US to South Sudan without the chance to contest their removal. After a failed court intervention, the three liberal US Supreme Court justices stated:

The government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard.

In the UK, the Labour party expanded the “Deport Now Appeal Later” scheme in August, extending the countries to which people can be deported without appeal rights from eight to 23.

And this month in Australia, the Migration Act was amended to expunge the rules of natural justice for people scheduled for deportation.

Across all three countries, the rapid expansion of detention and deportation practices terrorise those targeted, leaving whole communities living in fear. Australian human rights lawyer Alison Battisson described deportation as “a creeping death to the individuals and their families”.

These policies have also legitimised and emboldened far-right, neo-Nazi groups, who have taken to the streets in both the UK and Australia in recent weeks calling for an end to migration. In both countries, the effects of decades of neoliberal policies, such as a lack of affordable housing, jobs, and health care, are redefined as a problem of migration.

How communities are responding

Communities are now organising and making the case for a different sort of politics.

In Los Angeles, for example, grassroots organisations mobilised earlier this year to counter escalating raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Networks also began providing information and support to those targeted by ICE arrests. In July, Detention Watch Network relaunched the Communities Not Cages coalition of grassroots campaigns against detention.

In the UK, far-right rallies at asylum hotels have been met by counter demonstrations, with people insisting on a politics of welcome and unity.

But the challenge remains how to turn local and national opposition into a coalition capable of confronting this rise in authoritarian politics of exclusion and expulsion.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/691521/original/file-20250917-56-xx605z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C372%2C4463%2C2231&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-03 08:56:35.638599

Katherine Meagan Vogel, 39, has been charged by criminal complaint with the felony offense of assaulting a federal officer.

According to court documents, on the evening of September 30, 2025, federal officers detained Vogel after she applied red paint to the driveway of the ICE facility. Federal officers escorted Vogel to the ICE facility to interview her for conduct related to depredation of government property. While federal officers processed her, Vogel struck one of the federal officers in the jaw with a closed fist. Officers then arrested her for the additional charge of assaulting a federal officer.

“Violence and property damage at the ICE building or any other federal building will not be tolerated. If you assault a federal law enforcement officer or damage federal property, you will be arrested and federally prosecuted,” said Scott E. Bradford, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.

Since June 13, 2025, the United States Attorney’s Office has charged 28 defendants with federal crimes for offenses committed at the ICE building, including assaulting federal officers, failure to comply, and depredation of government property.

Vogel made her first appearance in federal court today before a U.S. Magistrate Judge. She was released on conditions pending further court proceedings.

Felony assault of a federal officer is punishable by up to eight years in federal prison.

“There are a number of ramifications if the public can’t believe what law enforcement is saying; then law enforcement probably can’t depend on the cooperation of citizens to report information to them accurately,” Pence said.
ICE agents alleged that Gonzalez-Romero violently resisted arrest off-camera, too, even attempting to bite an ICE agent.
“My sense is the vast majority of members of the public understand that there is more physical resistance to law enforcement and assaults on law enforcement,” Suthers said.
“And you’re creating a whole generation … U.S. citizens … of young people who don’t trust law enforcement and don’t respect law enforcement.”","In June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials made an eye-popping claim about the dangers faced by officers as they increased detentions and patrols across the United States.

“Our officers are facing a 413 percent increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murders (sic), rapists and gang members,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release after a man was charged with punching a Customs and Border Protection officer in Los Angeles. “If you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Then, as cities and states began to question the tactics used by ICE agents to conceal their identities with masks and street clothes while conducting rapid smash-and-grab operations to detain immigrants, the number of assaults ICE claimed were being endured by agents nationwide escalated at an astonishing rate.

A week after the 413 percent increase claim, ICE said assaults on agents had now jumped 500 percent, according to Homeland Security. By July 8, it was up 700 percent. A week later, it was 830 percent.

By early August, the head of ICE said in a television interview that the number of assaults on ICE officers had recently gone up more than “1,000” percent. ICE and Homeland Security officials never made clear what they were comparing it to in the past, and released no data to support the big numbers. Just last week, President Donald Trump said in an executive order that the 1,000 percent increase was as compared to the same period a year ago.

This week, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi relied on the same 1,000 percent claim in a memo ordering the deployment of additional federal agents to Portland, Ore. and Chicago to “defend ICE facilities.”

Once again, no data was provided, but after nudging the claim to 1,000 percent through the summer, ICE stuck with it into October.

“A lot of people don’t truly take the time to understand the law enforcement mission that we do and the significant public safety threats that are out there,” said Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director. “It’s one of the things that’s keeping me up at night … the threats are real.”

There is no question that ICE agents have faced increasingly dangerous work conditions and assaults around the nation, including some that could have turned deadly.

Fifteen people were charged this summer after what authorities called a July 4 plot to lure ICE agents out of a Texas detention center where they were then fired upon. A civilian police officer was wounded. In other cases, criminal affidavits show that Customs and Border Protection officers have been punched on patrol. Another ICE agent in California said he was dragged by a car. In Omaha, an ICE agent was slammed to the ground during an arrest and had to be hospitalized. Last week, a sniper opened fire on an ICE detention center in Texas, killing two detainees, though federal officials believe immigration agents were his target.

But despite repeated requests from CPR News for data underlying the claims of a massive jump in assaults justifying the use of masks, concealed identities and a surge of federal law enforcement in American cities, ICE and Homeland Security representatives have produced nothing but a handful of anecdotes. And while the agency promises that every person who assaults an ICE agent “will face the full extent of the law,” a CPR News examination of federal court records found that the number of federal cases has risen, but at nowhere near the rate claimed by the agencies.

President Trump has readily acknowledged his penchant for exaggeration over the years. As far back as 1987, he called it “truthful hyperbole” in his book, “The Art of the Deal.”

But when law enforcement officers engage in hype or make outright misleading statements, it jeopardizes trust in that system, said former FBI agent and leader Bob Pence.

Pence, who now lives in Littleton, served in various roles in the Bureau from 1962 to 1992, ending his career as Special Agent in Charge of the Rocky Mountain region. He then wrote a book published in 2020, “My Non-Political FBI: From Hoover to a Violent America.”

Pence noted that even something as minor as exaggerating claims of assault on ICE officers has a cost.

“There are a number of ramifications if the public can’t believe what law enforcement is saying; then law enforcement probably can’t depend on the cooperation of citizens to report information to them accurately,” Pence said. “They won’t make calls to law enforcement. If they’re asked, they may rationalize and say, well if they’re not capable of telling the truth, then I don’t need to tell the truth about this anyway.”

National data shows that charges of assault against federal officers have risen 25 percent so far in 2025 through mid-September compared to the same period a year ago, according to the federal courts database.

All of these events coincide with a sharp increase in the number of enforcement actions, as ICE is under pressure to find and remove millions from the country. But those operations are cloaked in secrecy — including who they are detaining, how many they’re detaining, how they are detaining them, and even sometimes where they take them — making it impossible to track their frequency in order to calculate a rate of assaults per federal enforcement action.

In Colorado, in the last decade, there have been five cases filed in federal court for assault on immigration agents, one in 2017 and four since Trump took office this year. One of those has already been dismissed. A second, which was heard in federal court Thursday, could meet the same fate, illustrating the complexities at the intersection of immigration law and criminal law.

In that case, agents detained the immigrant, Alejandro Guereca-Lizarraga, on July 25 at the Falcon Meadows Campground. They allege that he was initially compliant, but began to resist arrest after learning they were immigration officers. An agent said Guereca-Lizarraga kicked him, despite having his hands and feet shackled, and then spat at an agent at the detention facility.

A federal magistrate ruled Thursday there was probable cause for the case to proceed to trial. But the man’s public defender said she expected him to be deported as soon as next week, which would prompt dismissal of the case.

Another Colorado case involved a truck hitting an agent’s vehicle in Denver, while they were in it, according to the agents. Another case includes no details, but allegedly occurred last month.

Nationwide, charges of assault on all federal officers across all agencies didn’t start to rise until recently.

In the last three months, case filings of assaults on all officers nationwide have jumped 74 percent from the previous quarter. Most of that increase can be attributed to unrest in Los Angeles, where ICE has engaged in large-scale enforcement operations since June.

Those incidents have led to protests throughout that city. But those cases, and others nationally, have also provided indications that the public broadly is beginning to question the credibility of some of the federal government’s claims.

A man in Washington, D.C., in August threw a ham sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent and was charged with assaulting a federal officer. But prosecutors, a couple of weeks later, failed to get a grand jury to indict the man. In Los Angeles, federal prosecutors attempted to get felony indictments against at least 38 people involved in those protests and civil unrest or near immigration raids, but were successful in persuading citizens to indict their neighbors just seven times, according to local reporting. Other charges were dismissed, reduced to misdemeanors or resolved by plea deals.

Grand juries need to find only that there is probable cause that a crime was committed for a case to go to trial. Winning convictions by proving a case “beyond a reasonable doubt” is an even higher standard.

But even when including the cases reduced to misdemeanors, the number of actual charges filed across the country is small. For Homeland Security and ICE claims of a 1,000 percent increase in assaults to be true, there would also have to be thousands of other assaults that did not result in criminal charges, despite the government's claim that all assaults on federal agents will be prosecuted.

Scott Mechkowski, a former Deputy Field Office Director for ICE in New York City, said the court filings will never fully reflect the frequency of assaults on immigration agents.

“The way it's presented and prosecuted in federal court is different for us,” he said. “Like we were told — most of the time our guys got bit or they got punched — and we were told (by federal prosecutors) that's part of the job.”

Mechkowski said the only people who truly collect the number of assaults on ICE officers is ICE.

But CPR News' requests for any data kept by that agency were denied, with a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declining to cite where they got the data or even how they arrived at a 1,000 percent increase when announcing it in August. They did send one email with six links to old press releases, again citing a 1,000 percent increase in assaults without explanation. Later, DHS sent an email with press releases for 12 cases of assault on agents.

A spokesman for ICE in Colorado declined multiple requests for comment on specific cases of assault on agents this year.

Assaults on local police in Colorado have stayed relatively flat from year to year from 2022 to today, though some departments, like Aurora, have experienced an increase.

Officers there are assaulted dozens of times a year. In 2024, there were 130 assaults on Aurora officers — up from 98 in 2023 — a 33 percent increase, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

“It certainly seems more common today than it was in the past. I don’t disagree with the general notion that the job of a law enforcement officer today is much, much tougher than it has in the past and that’s largely because of a greater willingness for people to resist law enforcement or actively assault them,” said John Suthers, a former state attorney general, U.S. attorney and mayor of Colorado Springs. “I think the notion that law enforcement is trying to convey is correct.""

But unlike local police in Colorado, federal immigration agents don’t wear body cameras, and it’s often their word against an alleged assailant. Mechkowski, the former ICE supervisor, said he wished he had had body cameras when he was working enforcement, because it would exonerate him of any wrongdoing.

“I would win 100 times out of 100 on my arrests. I was never mean to anybody. You know what I mean? I never used force that wasn't necessary.”

Even in cases where video clearly shows an assault — though perhaps not as dramatically as ICE claims — it is no guarantee that the case will result in a conviction.

Take the case of Abraham Gonzalez-Romero.

Gonzalez-Romero’s initial criminal cases were shaky. State prosecutors had charged him with attempted murder with little evidence except that he was in possession of a firearm at a scene where shots were fired. The only witnesses to the case were also in the country without authorization and had credibility problems.

The local charges were eventually dismissed.

On Feb. 28, ICE agents were waiting for him as he left the jail, having been notified of his pending release by the Denver Sheriff after ICE asked about him. They flashed their badges and began walking towards him, he ran and was captured on jail video knocking an immigration agent to the ground.

ICE agents alleged that Gonzalez-Romero violently resisted arrest off-camera, too, even attempting to bite an ICE agent. He was charged under the federal statute for assaulting an officer. If anyone was injured, it was not serious enough to require immediate treatment. Denver Fire records don’t show any calls for service or medical assistance to the Smith Road location at that time.

But that didn’t stop his case from entering the national immigration debate.

Just a week later, House Republicans hosted a panel of big-city mayors, including Denver’s Mike Johnston, to talk about so-called sanctuary policies. Colorado Republican Rep. Jeff Crank told the story about Gonzalez-Romero, but he went a step further than even the ICE agent claimed.

“In Denver, you require that the Denver Police Department release Tren de Aragua gang members into the streets, uncuffed,” Crank said, animated as he addressed Johnston in the House hearing. “Just last week, it resulted in an illegal Tren de Aragua member assaulting and biting — and biting! — an ICE agent … You’re putting police officers at risk to score political points and it’s outrageous.”

But in court, federal prosecutors made no effort to prove Gonzalez-Romero bit, or even attempted to bite, an agent and his attorney said it never happened. Federal public defender Kelly Christl also said in court, “There’s no evidence to support that” he was a Tren de Aragua gang member. The U.S. Attorney didn’t present any evidence for that either.

The public defender for Gonzalez-Romero said that wasn’t the only thing that immigration agents got wrong: she told the court most of the violence an ICE supervisor said her client committed simply never happened.

“He did not kick the inside of the caged vehicle. He did not attempt to escape. He did not attempt to bite an officer. He did not tell officers that he wanted to fight them,” reads a court filing from August from Christl.

The government dropped the charge of assault on an officer as part of a plea deal in which Gonzalez-Romero pleaded guilty to “possession of a firearm by an illegal alien.” The U.S. Attorney said in court documents that the assault charge was dropped because of a lack of resources.

Gonzalez-Romero’s attorney quickly pounced on that.

“The government’s statement that this offer was made ‘due to available resources’ is without merit,” wrote Christl to the court, adding that the U.S. Attorney’s office certainly has the resources to prosecute hundreds of crimes every year.

“Furthermore, Attorney General Pam Bondi’s enforcement memorandum on February 5, 2025, specifically prioritizes prosecuting undocumented immigrants and obstruction of law enforcement. Certainly, if the government believed it could move forward on more serious offenses against Mr. Gonzalez-Romero, it would have, because he would otherwise fit the Attorney General’s enforcement priorities.”

Eve Sparks, a spokeswoman for Rep. Crank, said she wasn’t aware the assault against a federal officer charge was dropped, and she asked for proof. After the court documents were provided, she then didn’t respond to multiple requests for a comment or answer questions about where the congressman got the information about Gonzalez-Romero in the first place.

Gonzalez-Romero was sentenced in federal court to time served on the gun charge. The U.S. Attorney said he would be deported after being released.

The U.S. Attorney’s office would not comment on the decision to drop assault charges.

Other federal jobs more perilous, according to charges filed

While not backing up the enormous increases in assaults claimed by ICE and Homeland Security leaders, the federal data does make one thing clear: In Colorado, it’s far more dangerous to be an employee with the federal prisons or the Bureau of Indian Affairs than an ICE agent.

Between 2015 and June 2025, the majority of assaults on federal officers in Colorado were on Indian Country land and in the state’s federal prisons.

“My sense is the vast majority of members of the public understand that there is more physical resistance to law enforcement and assaults on law enforcement,” Suthers said. “It’s a much, much tougher job today than it was 20, 30 years ago and that is because of the public attitude that it’s OK to assault, resist and abuse officers.”

As for ICE assaults, Mechkowski, the former Deputy Field Office Director for ICE in New York, said federal prosecutors usually don’t pick up or aggressively pursue their cases.

“Most of the time, they’re just blanket denying these cases before they have all the facts. They'll just deny it unless there's serious, serious bodily injury,” Mechkowski said.

The importance of law enforcement credibility

In two of the four cases filed this year in Colorado's federal court against people for assaulting an immigration agent, a federal magistrate determined that the defendant did not pose a threat to the public and released them into the community to await trial.

On July 25, ICE agents said they were assaulted by Alejandro Guereca-Lizarraga while he was in custody on an immigration detainer. According to a criminal complaint filed in federal court, Guereca-Lizarraga kicked an ICE agent and spat on a detention officer at the GEO facility in Aurora.

Federal Magistrate Judge Kathryn Starnella denied the prosecutor’s request to delay a detention hearing and ordered ICE to put him in street clothes for release. Guereca-Lizarraga’s attorney told the court he’s currently being held in immigration detention in Aurora. He pleaded not guilty.

A few weeks later, on Aug. 12, ICE agents claimed they were assaulted by Nelson Monjarrez Mejia. No other details of the encounter are publicly known. A grand jury returned an indictment a month later for Mejia on the assault charge, but Starnella again denied the government’s request for a detention hearing.

Mejia pleaded not guilty, and the judge also released him from jail to await trial.

Denver immigration attorney Christine Hernandez said there is a credibility cost for federal law enforcement in exaggerating facts.

Just this year, she has represented people where judges ask for evidence on links to gang affiliations and other stated facts and the prosecutors can’t furnish it.

“We’ve never seen this before,” Hernandez said. “You don’t know what the government is going to say. A lot of times, they don’t have evidence, they don’t present evidence to back up the charging document. You’re supposed to have your evidence in place. That’s their job. And it’s not happening.”

Hernandez worries about the younger generation of Americans who are witnessing it all.

“We’re creating a whole generation of U.S. citizens who are watching their parents be mistreated in this administration,” she said. “And you’re creating a whole generation … U.S. citizens … of young people who don’t trust law enforcement and don’t respect law enforcement.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/250205-CEDAR-RUN-APARTMENTS-WASH-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 00:57:09.625392

The judge in Baltimore on Wednesday rejected an application to reopen Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum case, but that is not the final word. Abrego Garcia has 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

The Salvadoran national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager. In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the U.S. for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by President Donald Trump‘s administration in March and was held in a notorious prison, and his case soon became a rallying point for those who oppose the Republican president’s immigration crackdown. Facing a ruling from the Supreme Court, the administration returned him to the U.S. in June, only to immediately charge him with human smuggling.

Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges in Tennessee, based on a 2022 traffic stop. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is also seeking to deport him to a third country, proposing Uganda first and then Eswatini, a small country in southern Africa where the king still holds absolute power. His attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.

Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case is a calculated risk. If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship. But if he loses, an immigration judge could remove his protection from being returned to his native country. That could place him back in the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. It’s where, he alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

His lawyers have filed motions requesting a gag order and say he will not be able to receive a fair trial because of the “highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements” made about him.

While the federal judge in Tennessee can order prosecutors there not to make any prejudicial statements about Abrego Garcia, it is unclear whether the judge’s authority extends to the Department of Homeland Security, which posted about the immigration court ruling on X on Wednesday.

“His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country,” according to the post.

For more than two decades, Parliament has systematically overridden High Court decisions protecting individual rights, from migration law to anti-terrorism legislation. The recent legislative response to the case known as the NZYQ decision – which struck down indefinite immigration detention as unconstitutional – represents a dangerous escalation that creates a template for undermining democratic governance worldwide.

This pattern represents more than domestic policy disputes. It reveals a fundamental flaw in Australia’s constitutional architecture that authoritarian leaders could exploit to justify their own attacks on judicial independence.

The Constitutional cat-and-mouse game

Australia’s parliamentary override operates through a sophisticated legal mechanism that circumvents judicial protection without technically violating constitutional principles. When the High Court rules legislation unconstitutional, Parliament doesn’t change the Constitution – it cannot, as constitutional amendments require referendum under Section 128. Instead, Parliament changes the statute itself, creating new legal frameworks that achieve identical practical outcomes while claiming technical compliance with constitutional limits.

This “cat-and-mouse game” works because Australia’s Westminster system fuses executive and legislative power, enabling rapid statutory responses to judicial decisions. The High Court only examines legislation when specifically challenged in court, meaning Parliament can pass substantially similar laws that take months or years to challenge again. During this litigation period, the government achieves practical override of judicial protection.

The 2023–25 immigration detention cycle demonstrates this mechanism. After NZYQ vs Minister for Immigration ruled indefinite detention unconstitutional, Parliament immediately passed harsh monitoring conditions. When the High Court struck those down in YBFZ vs Minister as punitive, Parliament introduced the “Anti-Fairness Bill” that retrospectively validates decisions NZYQ rendered unlawful.

What makes Australia unique

Australia maintains the dubious honour of being the sole liberal democracy without a national bill of rights. This creates vulnerabilities distinguishing Australia from other parliamentary sovereignty systems. While the United Kingdom and New Zealand maintain statutory bills that their parliaments can override, these require compatibility statements and incompatibility declarations, creating political costs. Australia’s protections, by contrast, rest on fragile common law presumptions, five express constitutional rights, and one implied right. These have proven inadequate against retrospective legislation, leaving rights exposed to systematic parliamentary nullification without democratic debate.

While Canada’s “notwithstanding clause” allows similar overrides, it requires explicit political justification and expires automatically after five years. The UK’s Human Rights Act requires compatibility statements before passing potentially incompatible legislation.

Australia’s system operates through stealth – achieving override through technical statutory amendments without transparent democratic debate. This reflects what legal scholar Samuel Naylor identifies as a “deficit of constitutional culture” in Australia’s response to judicial decisions.

The Australian Human Rights Commission has documented this pattern, noting that government “routinely returns to Parliament to amend the law to permit what the Court has determined to be unlawful” across multiple policy areas beyond immigration.

Regional and global implications

Australia’s constitutional vulnerability creates diplomatic contradictions that undermine democratic norms regionally. It is a systemic flaw with foreign policy implications.

The international community must recognise that threats to democracy come not only from obvious authoritarians but from constitutional vulnerabilities in established democracies.

When Australia advocates for judicial independence in ASEAN nations, for example, while maintaining constitutional arrangements at home that permit routine legislative override of court decisions, it creates a fundamental credibility gap.

This matters particularly in contexts where Australia criticises authoritarian practices. Myanmar’s military leadership and Cambodia’s ruling party face international pressure for ignoring court decisions and manipulating legal frameworks. Australia’s systematic override mechanism provides a constitutional template that, while technically democratic, achieves similar practical nullification of judicial protection.

The concern isn’t that authoritarian leaders explicitly cite Australia’s example – it’s that Australia’s constitutional arrangements legitimate the principle that legislative or executive majorities in parliamentary systems can systematically circumvent judicial protection of individual rights.

The migration law laboratory

Immigration law serves as Australia’s constitutional laboratory for testing override mechanisms. Since 2001, Parliament has responded to adverse High Court decisions with increasingly sophisticated statutory workarounds. The Al-Kateb vs Godwin decision normalised indefinite detention until NZYQ reversed it. Parliament’s response cycle – immediate legislative override, court challenge, refined legislative response – has become institutionalised.

The Anti-Fairness Bill represents the most comprehensive override yet attempted, retrospectively validating government decisions made under invalid legal frameworks. This creates precedent for parliamentary nullification of judicial decisions across policy areas, from environmental law to civil liberties.

Policy implications

Australia needs constitutional reform before this template spreads. Three immediate steps could limit the damage.

First, Parliament should adopt procedural safeguards requiring compatibility statements before passing potentially unconstitutional legislation. Second, retrospective validation of invalid government decisions should require supermajority approval. Third, Australia needs serious consideration of legislating a national Human Rights Act providing entrenched protection against parliamentary override.

Internationally, Australia’s democratic partners should recognise this constitutional vulnerability when assessing Australia’s credibility on rule-of-law advocacy. Regional institutions such as the East Asia Summit should develop stronger mechanisms for protecting judicial independence that address both authoritarian attacks and democratic erosion.

The broader threat

Australia’s parliamentary override mechanism represents democratic backsliding through constitutional means. Unlike Hungary’s court-packing or Poland’s judicial purges, Australia’s system operates within established democratic procedures while achieving similar practical nullification of judicial oversight.

This makes Australia’s template particularly dangerous – it provides authoritarian movements worldwide with a constitutionally legitimate method for systematically undermining judicial independence. The international community must recognise that threats to democracy come not only from obvious authoritarians but from constitutional vulnerabilities in established democracies.

Australia’s experiment with parliamentary override threatens to become a global precedent for circumventing judicial protection.

Trump promised cuts to ‘Democrat agencies’

The president described the ongoing government shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to enact sweeping cuts to the federal government. He said today that he would meet with his budget chief to determine which “Democrat agencies” he could try to cut.

The White House press secretary also said that it was “likely” the government could shed workers by the “thousands” if the shutdown continues. Still, Democrats showed little sign of budging from their demand for Republican concessions on health care in exchange for their vote to fund the government.

An attacker killed 2 at a British synagogue on Yom Kippur

A man attacked a synagogue in Manchester, England, today, using a car and a knife to kill two people and injure four others on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The police said they shot and killed the man minutes after he began his assault, which the country’s counterterrorism police formally labeled an act of terrorism.

The police identified the attacker as Jihad al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent. The attack came at a time of rising antisemitism around the world and in Britain. Here’s what we know about what happened.

Channing Tatum is finding his confidence

Channing Tatum’s unusual ability to convey character with effortless sincerity seems to be rediscovered every few years — first with “Step Up” and “She’s the Man,” and later in the Oscar-nominated “Foxcatcher.” Even Tatum has had a hard time believing in his talent.

Now, as his starring performance in “Roofman” arrives in theaters, he told our culture reporter Kyle Buchanan that he finally feels like he can hold his own. “For the very first time in my life,” Tatum said, “I feel like I could sit across from even the most beautifully trained British actor and go toe-to-toe with them and not feel like I’m apologizing as I’m acting with them.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/02evening-nl-lede-ktqv/02evening-nl-lede-ktqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 00:56:56.858620

The funds came from $150 billion Congress funneled to the Federal Emergency Management Agency this year to assist with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration sought federal money to cover the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, which is in the Everglades. The state opened another immigrant-detention center in Baker County last month.

The Everglades facility, which began accepting detainees in July, has sparked legal challenges. One of the lawsuits alleges that state and federal officials failed to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study before the facility could be constructed.

A key issue in the case has been a contention by DeSantis and federal officials that an environmental-impact study was not necessary because the site was being operated by the state and its contractors.

But Elise Bennett, a lawyer who is the Florida and Caribbean director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the state’s receipt of the federal money “the smoking gun proving that our lawsuit challenging Alligator Alcatraz is entirely correct.”

The detention center is a “federal project being built with federal funds that’s required by federal law to go through a complete environmental review,” she said Thursday in a statement.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management spent about $218 million to erect the facility, which had a capacity for 2,000 people and could be expanded, according to court records.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued an order telling the state to stop bringing in detainees and to wind down operations at the remote facility.

But a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month put Williams’ order on hold and allowed the state to continue using the detention center.

The Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Everglades and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida contend in the lawsuit that the facility, which is surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve, threatens the environment and wildlife in the area.

But state and federal officials say the facility is adjacent to a decades-old airstrip known as the Collier-Dade Training and Transition Center.

Speaking to reporters last week, DeSantis said federal officials “could do a very quick impact statement” to show that the site was not having a negative effect on the environment, but that a study was not necessary.",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2025/08/deportation-depot-florida.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-02 23:56:21.975370
