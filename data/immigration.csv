Officials say the woman, a mother of three and a U.S. citizen born in Colorado, was inside her car when she was shot. The confrontation was captured on video, fueling public outcry and leading several city and state leaders to call for ICE to leave Minneapolis.

While Minneapolis deals with its own conflict involving federal immigration authorities, Boston is currently in the middle of a separate legal battle with ICE.

The federal government and the City of Boston are clashing in court over the city’s sanctuary policy — specifically, the Boston Trust Act and whether it interferes with federal immigration enforcement.

In a recent court filing, federal officials allege that Boston’s policy causes local police to “categorically flout” immigration enforcement officers, allowing individuals to “evade ICE apprehension.”

The Boston Trust Act, last amended in 2019, allows Boston police to prioritize criminal law enforcement while leaving civil immigration matters to federal authorities.

The city has argued in court that the policy has contributed to making Boston the safest major city in the country and has asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed.

This case is one of several lawsuits the federal government has filed challenging sanctuary city policies across the U.S.

Several of those laws, especially one taking over the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, have been held up in court for years.

The fight dates back to 2023, when Republicans in the Tennessee General Assembly passed several bills aimed at stripping power from Metro, following the Metro Council’s refusal to support a bid for the Republican National Convention. Several of those laws, especially one taking over the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, have been held up in court for years.

Metro sued the state over the law restricting the council’s size, and in 2024 a three-judge trial court panel ruled that the law breached the state constitution’s Home Rule Amendment.

“This bill was full of extraordinary provisions that were a gross overreach of their constitutional authority,” Dietz said.

But last year, an appellate court panel reversed that decision in a split ruling that said the law did not violate the Home Rule Amendment because it “clearly applies to all counties that have formed or will form a consolidated metropolitan government.” Nashville’s is one of just three metropolitan governments in the state, and it’s the only one with a legislative body made up of more than 20 members.

Judge Kenny Armstrong dissented from the appellate panel decision, pointing out that the state constitution explicitly exempts metropolitan governments from a 25-member cap on the number of seats a local government body can have.

The Tennessee Supreme Court granted Metro’s request for an expedited hearing on the case.

Dietz told the council’s Charter Revision Committee on Wednesday that Metro will file its final brief in the case by Jan. 16, and Supreme Court hearings on both the council and the airport authority cases are expected on Feb. 12. He said the legal department is working on its oral argument, and that there is no specific timeframe for a potential decision to be handed down.

Metro will argue next month that the law violates the Home Rule Amendment and the specific constitutional provision exempting metropolitan governments from a cap on legislative body size. Dietz said Metro would also argue that the entire law is moot because the implementation deadlines in the case passed nearly three years ago.

The Metro Planning Department was already working on new maps reflecting a smaller Metro Council in 2023 before an injunction put the law on hold. That work could pick up speed in the coming months if the council is forced to shrink itself ahead of 2027 Metro elections.

“We think we’re going to win, but if we don’t win we have to be prepared for having an election in 2027 with a vastly different landscape,” Dietz said.

Nashville voters soundly rejected a 2015 charter amendment proposal that would have reduced the Metro Council from 40 members to 27.

“I don’t expect us to lose, but I also think we need to engage the public as quickly as we can,” Councilmember Emily Benedict said.

During legislative deliberation, Sen. Mark Pody (R-Lebanon) was the only Republican senator to vote against the bill. He is the only Republican to represent any part of Nashville in the legislature.

“I hate where the state is reaching down and telling local governments what to do,” he said.

House Majority Leader William Lamberth was a main champion of the bill, alternating between criticizing Nashville governance and claiming that the legislation was about more than just Nashville.

“This isn’t just about Nashville,” Lamberth said. “It’s about every single city in this state not being able to expand and make the mistake Nashville made 50 years ago to have 40 members.”

Sumner County, Lamberth’s home, has a county commission made up of 24 members, plus nearly 50 more councilmembers and commissioners in the county’s municipalities.",https://i0.wp.com/nashvillebanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Metro-Council-Safety-committee-11-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-08 07:56:58.917334

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: That immigrant-detention center in the Everglades has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or re-enter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social-media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-yearolds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers.

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.",http://www.aroundosceola.com/sites/aroundosceola.com/files/2026-01/Legislative-update.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 07:57:17.747495

The woman shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent during a federal operation in the US state of Minnesota has been identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Good was fatally shot on Wednesday, Jan. 7, just blocks from her home, where she lived with her partner and three children, according to media reports.

Speaking to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, said that family members were notified of her death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid,” Ganger said after learning details of the shooting, adding: “She was probably terrified.”

Ganger said that her daughter was not involved in any protest directed at ICE agents, adding: “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known.”

""She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

An Instagram account appearing to belong to Good describes her as a poet, writer, wife and mother living in Minneapolis. She previously studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia, where she won the school’s undergraduate poetry prize in 2020.

University President Brian O. Hemphill, in a statement, said Good graduated from the school in 2020 with an English degree, calling her killing ""yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation.""

""May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,"" Hemphill said, adding: ""My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.”

Good was previously married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., who died in 2023, according to the Tribune. His father, Timmy Ray Macklin Sr., said the couple shared a 6-year-old child. “There’s nobody else in his life,” Macklin said. “I’ll drive. I’ll fly. To come and get my grandchild.”

Hundreds gathered Wednesday evening for a vigil near Good’s home, chanting her name as they walked through the neighborhood. Speakers described her as a peaceful neighbor who acted out of care for others.

Neighbors described Good as warm and attentive, often outside with her young son. “It’s a beautiful family,” Mary Radford, who lived next door, told the newspaper. “We’re gonna miss seeing them -- forever.”

Good’s shooting

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed that Good, 37, attempted to hit officers with her vehicle, prompting an agent to fire in what officials described as an act of ""self-defense.""

Local officials disputed that account, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying he reviewed video footage of the shooting and rejected claims that it was justified, calling it a reckless use of force. He demanded that the federal immigration agents leave the city.

Releasing a joint statement on the incident, the Minneapolis City Council said Good was a resident whose “life was taken today at the hands of the federal government.”

“Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” said the council, demanding ICE “immediately leave our city so we can get rid of their chaos and violence that ended the life of one of our neighbors today.”

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on the US social media company X that ICE officers were conducting targeted operations when ""rioters"" began blocking them and ""one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle.""

An ICE officer ""used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said, adding that officers injured in the incident were expected to make full recoveries.

But Gov. Tim Walz echoed the mayor's view, calling the Department of Homeland Security's account of the incident the product of ""propaganda.""

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,"" he wrote on X.

Frey said he was aware of the shooting, while accusing federal immigration enforcement agents of causing ""chaos"" in Minneapolis.

""We're demanding ICE to leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,"" Frey wrote on X.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/08/thumbs_b_c_af7ab2dfdc4cb72c99446c4e402c8299.jpg?v=123203,N,,2026-01-08 06:57:02.525879

Jessica Tarlov, a prominent left-leaning voice on Fox News, shared a video of the shooting on X and called it “horrific”.
On MS NOW, former chief of the US Capitol police Tom Manger also criticized the remarks by Frey, the Minneapolis mayor.
While video spread quickly across social media, CNN said it would need to verify it before being able to show it.
“I want to warn viewers that this video is hard to watch,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said.","Cable news networks sprung into action on Wednesday to cover the breaking news of a woman killed by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, rushing correspondents to the scene and bringing on former government officials and legal analysts to offer commentary.

The three main cable networks’ on-screen graphics framed the incident slightly differently. Fox News referred to it as a “Deadly ICE-involved Shooting”, while CNN said more plainly: “ICE Officer Kills Woman in Minneapolis.”

The progressive network MS NOW – formerly MSNBC – also characterized the incident in part as “Agent Kills Woman” in an on-screen graphic.

Both CNN and Fox News brought on former officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide analysis based on their government experience, though their conclusions differed.

John Sandweg, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the Obama administration, questioned whether the federal agents had been properly trained and vetted.

“My immediate concern is this: to what extent has this rushing of hiring of people – this shortcutting on our trainin g – to what extent might that have informed what happened here,” he said on CNN.

Chad Wolf, the former acting United States secretary of homeland security, appeared on Fox News and criticized Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, for his comments during a press conference, when he told ICE to “get the fuck out of” the city.

“The mayor’s comments were probably some of the most unintelligible, unhinged comments I think I’ve heard in quite some time,” Wolf said, accusing Frey of having unfairly blamed the federal agents while laying “no blame at all on the individuals that are impeding law enforcement”.

“If you get in their way, and you don’t take their commands, well then that’s against the law,” Wolf added.

Paul Mauro, a Fox News contributor and former inspector in the New York City police department, also seemed to put blame on the protesters, saying many “really want confrontation” and document ICE actions using cellphone video “to get social media clicks”.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham said the incident is “the legacy of the normalization of violence and disrespect toward law enforcement that was legitimized and in many ways celebrated – mostly by the Democrats, far-left agitators, for years”.

But network personalities and guests were not unified in their perspective on the incident.

Jessica Tarlov, a prominent left-leaning voice on Fox News, shared a video of the shooting on X and called it “horrific”. “A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman,” she said.

On MS NOW, former chief of the US Capitol police Tom Manger also criticized the remarks by Frey, the Minneapolis mayor. “When elected officials get out in front of an investigation and give you their conclusions, I don’t know how helpful that is,” he said.

While video spread quickly across social media, CNN said it would need to verify it before being able to show it. “I want to warn viewers that this video is hard to watch,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said.

On MS NOW, Nicolle Wallace aired one of the most widely shared videos, cautioning viewers that it is “really disturbing” but said it was “really important” for people to see.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4e480bb47cc4a6d20757cb0ddf1348365ca86a/123_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=642ae420990152698a60273bfe1abaed",N,,2026-01-08 06:57:06.119853

Reporters and witnesses have also shared to Bluesky photos of Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino at the scene. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security writes that the ICE agent, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Frey said he’s watched a video of the incident. “They [DHS] are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit,” he said.

In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois during the feds’ enforcement surge in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Unraveled Press were the first to report that the initial narrative of events from the Department of Homeland Security was quickly disproven by videos captured by witnesses.

Bovino and his team of federal agents have carried out immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, and in his home state of North Carolina — with Charlotte being the city specifically targeted by agents. More federal operations have taken place in Louisiana and in Minnesota.

1:35 p.m.

WARNING — Graphic video and details from the scene.

Phil Lewis, deputy editor at the Huffington Post, shared witness video of the incident on social media. He said the witness originally shared the video with the Minnesota Reformer.

The video begins with agents getting out of a pickup truck and walking over to a Honda SUV. Multiple agents surround the SUV. As one masked agent tries to open the driver’s side door of the SUV, the driver of the SUV backs up. A woman’s voice behind the video camera can be heard screaming “no.”

Another agent appears from the front of the SUV, reaching for his waistband. As the driver of the SUV pulls forward, the agent points his gun at the driver and fires multiple shots. The woman’s voice behind the camera can be heard screaming, “oh my f-cking God!”

The SUV veers off, crashing into parked cars on the street. The woman behind the camera screams, “what the f-ck did you do?!”

Agents rush over to the crashed SUV. Witnesses also walk towards the SUV with their cellphone cameras in hand. The video shows some graphic images of the scene before agents begin to cordon off the area.

2:50 p.m.

“I want Minnesotans to hear this from me. The desire to get out of the protest and to speak up to this administration [about] how wrong this is, that is a patriotic duty,” Walz told reporters, adding that civil unrest must be done peacefully.

Walz said the Minnesota National Guard is on standby.

“They’re there to protect you and protect your constitutional rights. These are our neighbors. They don’t wear masks,” Walz said about the Minnesota National Guard. He said the guard members are not bussed in from somewhere else.

He added that the National Guard would protect people and protect in the event that disruptors want to be destructive, as Minneapolis experienced during the civil unrest following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.

2:55 p.m.

Walz told reporters if he activates the Minnesota National Guard, he would do so under an executive order, “and then they will be put in state duty status.”

Walz told Minnesotans do not give the Trump administration a reason to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in federal troops into Minneapolis. He asked rhetorically, “is this the McCarthy moment?”

“We have a chaotic situation caused by the largest deployment in American history of federal agents into a community with no communication to locals. We had a chaotic situation where an individual is in their car, shot and killed,” Walz said.

He continued, “I want to be very cautious here, because Donald Trump will make this about me. He will make this about politics. This is about public safety, and this about normalcy. To Americans who are watching this, if you’re in Portland or you’re in LA, or you’re in Chicago, or you are wherever they’re coming next, stand with us.

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon following the shooting, mayor Frey told ICE agents to ""get the f--- out of Minneapolis.""","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman Wednesday during an immigration-related operation in Minneapolis in which she did not appear to be the target, local and federal officials said.

Dueling narratives emerged over what led to the shooting. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed the woman “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on DHS’s narrative in a press conference Wednesday afternoon, saying, “they are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,” referring to ICE. “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is b---s---.”

Witnesses described seeing the woman in the vehicle trying to flee officers when she was shot, disputing the notion that she was attempting to run officers over. Police described the deceased as a “middle-aged white woman” who did not appear to be the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.

Immigration enforcement officers were conducting targeted operations in Minneapolis when the shooting happened, but it’s unclear what operation ICE was conducting in that particular neighborhood.

U.S. & World

Several video clips of the incident emerged on social media.

In one video, a gray pick-up truck is seen pulling up to a burgundy SUV stopped perpendicular to the truck as someone shouts “get the f— out of our neighborhood.” Agents get out of the truck, and one walks up to the SUV and yanks on the driver’s door handle, ordering the driver to get out. The vehicle reverses.

Another agent is standing near the front of the SUV as it pulls forward. The agent appears to draw his firearm and as the SUV drives forward in his direction he moves backward, shooting into the SUV as it drives off, the video shows.

In another video showing a different angle of the scene, the agent appears to be knocked back as the SUV drives forward before crashing into a parked car and hitting a light pole. President Donald Trump attached the video clip showing this angle to a post on Truth Social, saying the woman driving was “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting,” and that it was hard to believe the agent survived the incident.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference Wednesday evening that the ICE agent was ""hit by the vehicle"" driven by the woman who was shot. He went to the hospital and was released, she said.

Noem said the officer, whom officials have not yet identified, had been attacked before while on the job.

“The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time as well,” she said.

Noem said at a press conference earlier in the day that the agents’ vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman “attacked them.”

“It was an act of domestic terrorism,” she said, without providing further evidence.

At the mayor's news conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara expressed concern about the tactics used by ICE agents.

“I do not know the exact circumstances of the shooting, but I would tell you, in any professional law enforcement agency in the country ... it’s obviously very concerning whenever there’s a shooting into a vehicle of someone who’s not armed,” he said, noting that at times it could be justified, but that “most law enforcement agencies in the country have trained very intensely to try and minimize the risk” of using deadly force.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he witnessed the incident and it didn’t look like the woman was trying to run over an agent.

“I heard that Noem is trying to say they were trying to run down an officer. There was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through,” he told NBC News, adding that it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

Emily Heller, 39, wasn’t even dressed when she heard whistles alerting the neighborhood that ICE agents were in the area this morning. When she walked out to her porch she said she saw six or seven ICE vehicles and a person who had parked perpendicular to traffic.

Heller said she saw agents exit their cars and tell the driver to leave, to “get out of here.”

“And then they went up to her car and started trying to open her door, and that’s when I’m sure she got spooked and tried to flee,” Heller said. “So she reversed a little bit and then angled her wheels so she could drive away. And as she was trying to move forward, one of the ICE agents stepped in front of her vehicle and reached across the hood and fired his weapon about three or four times and shot her in the face.”

Aidan’s wife Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood two and a half years and “we love it.”

“We are really happy here. We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue,” she said. “There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards.”

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

DHS stepping up immigration enforcement

Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The push has ramped up tensions with local officials in some cities and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts.

In September, in the Chicago area, an ICE agent fatally shot a man during a traffic stop. His family called for justice and local police said the FBI had been investigating the death.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said. That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12.

DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon following the shooting, mayor Frey told ICE agents to ""get the f--- out of Minneapolis.""

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday’s shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2026/01/MINN-SHOOTING-ICE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-08 02:57:24.590002

MINNEAPOLIS (OSV News) ─ Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda is continuing his call for prayers after police said a woman was pronounced dead following a shooting involving a federal agent in Minneapolis Jan. 7.

""Following this morning's deadly shooting in Minneapolis, I reiterate my plea for all people of good will to join me in prayer for the person who was killed, for their loved ones, and for our community,"" Archbishop Hebda, head of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, said in a statement following the incident, referring back to his request for prayers on Dec. 23 as immigration enforcement efforts in the Twin Cities drew concerns from some about attending Christmas Masses.

The incident Jan. 7 occurred in the area of 34th Street and Portland Avenue, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.

The woman shot by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been identified by Minnesota media as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet originally from Colorado.

During a news conference, O'Hara said police responded to the area after receiving a report of a federal law enforcement officer being involved in a deadly force incident, ""meaning shots had been fired.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security indicated on social media that ""ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations"" Jan. 7.

Upon arrival, O'Hara said officers found a woman who had suffered a gunshot wound to the head. O'Hara said CPR and other life-saving measures were administered and the woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

O'Hara said a preliminary investigation into the incident indicated the woman ""was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue, midway between 33rd Street and 34th Street in the city.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her, on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway,"" O'Hara said.

O'Hara said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are among the agencies investigating the incident.

""This has been a very difficult time for everyone in the city and this is obviously a very, very tragic situation where a woman has lost her life,"" O'Hara said.

""We've dreaded this moment since the early stages of this ICE presence in Minneapolis,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during his remarks at the news conference.

""We ask that the community continue to call for peace,"" O'Hara said. Frey agreed. ""Let's unite around hope and love and peace and getting justice, that's what we need to be doing right now,"" Frey said.

Archbishop Hebda in his statement appealed for all people ""to lower the temperature of rhetoric, stop fear-filled speculation and start seeing all people as created in the image and likeness of God.""

He said, ""That is as true for our immigrant sisters and brothers as it is for our elected officials and those who are responsible for enforcing our laws.""

Archbishop Hebda also said he wanted to ""echo today the repeated call of the U.S. Catholic bishops that we come together as a nation and pass meaningful immigration reform that does justice to all parties.""

He indicated that the issue is becoming ""more divisive and violent"" the longer the country refuses to grapple with it.

""It is only by working together -- with God's help -- that we will have peace in our communities, state and world,"" he said.",https://img.hghlnd.com/imgix/https://detroitcatholic.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/1152844/20260107T1647-MPLS-ICE-DEADLY-SHOOTING-1810807.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 01:56:27.558299

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2026/01/in-first-year-trump-targeted-nj-will-he-be-constrained/,"Nobody,” Trump said Tuesday, days after ordering a military raid to seize Venezuelan president Nicholás Maduro.
Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.
He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate.
“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.
Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies.","WASHINGTON – The margin for error for Republicans in Congress was slim before the unexpected death Tuesday of Doug LaMalfa, a conservative rice farmer from northern California: 220 to 213.

Along with the resignation Monday of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former supporter of President Trump who held a Georgia seat, LaMalfa’s death means House Republicans can lose two votes on a given bill and still pass it. “It’s not a big majority,” Trump said when asked about LaMalfa’s death. “But it’s a unified majority, and it’s people that know what it takes to make America great again.”

There are four vacancies in the House, including the former seat of Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey’s governor elect.

Facing a challenging mid-term election period this November – the president’s party on average loses 28 seats in the House of Representatives – Trump and Republicans in Congress, who hold control of both the House and Senate, show no signs of breaking from the swaggering governance style they embodied in 2025, both state-side and abroad.

“Nobody can take us. Nobody,” Trump said Tuesday, days after ordering a military raid to seize Venezuelan president Nicholás Maduro.

Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.

Backed with an immense public following, the commander in chief trained his ire against Democratic-leaning states, like New Jersey, where his administration canceled offshore wind projects, targeted climate grants, threatened transit projects and moved to jail Democratic officials. In the fall, after a group of lawmakers urged U.S. troops to disobey unlawful commands, Trump called their actions “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”

Domestically, Trump and his political allies punished critics, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th), the target of a federal prosecution in Newark, and a New York senator over the Gateway train-and-tunnel project. He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate. He refused to rule out a third term in the White House, something the U.S. Constitution bans. He and budget officials repeatedly broke the law, according to non-partisan watchdog groups, including by cancelling public-health grants. And he has surrounded himself with the trappings of a king: a military parade in the summer on his birthday, the bulldozing of the White House’s East Wing for a ballroom in his name and banners of his face on federal buildings.

“It’s just been so chaotic,” McIver said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “I never thought a bunch of grown people would not be able to work together for the betterment of the millions of people we serve.”

Workers in December hammered new letters, adding Trump’s name, into the facade of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in Washington – an act that drew legal challenges in federal court.

Though Trump campaigned in 2024 as a populist promising to lower costs for the average American, his signature bill Congress passed into law will benefit the rich and hurt the poor, according to economic analysts.

“This is a reverse Robin Hood,” Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at the think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “It is taking money from people who need it the most and giving it to people who need it the least.”

The wealthiest 10% of households will get an average of $13,600 in benefits annually because of the new law, while those in the lowest 10% of the economic system will lose roughly $1,200 each year.

At the same time, that law will remove about 400,000 people in New Jersey from the U.S.’s largest anti-hunger system, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides benefits of $6 a day on average.

Historically, states have not paid the costs to implement SNAP – something the new law changed. And New Jersey is in a small category of states that may be required to pay extra, under language Republicans included during the marathon summer negotiations on the bill.

State legislators in Trenton and Sherrill, a former Democratic House member and the incoming governor, are bracing for the impact the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, the federal health insurance system for the low-income and disabled, will deliver to the New Jersey state budget.

The state’s Department of Human Services estimates as many as 350,000 people in New Jersey could lose insurance directly due the law, and that, depending on how federal medical taxes are implemented, state hospitals could lose $2.8 billion.

“I think it’s probably fair to say this is the most significant federal legislation affecting Medicaid since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,” Greg Woods, assistant commissioner at the department, said after passage.

When they wrote the law, Republicans in Congress front-loaded tax breaks for people and held off cuts to these food and health programs, a strategy that may shield their party at the ballot box in November.

“The mindset was just to get people really used to it, to get the states used to having to be more efficient and for the system to work better,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd).

On the environment, Trump and his fellow Republicans in Washington have rescinded or watered down much of the Biden administration’s environmental legacy.

Beyond phasing out tax credits for renewable energy, such as a popular incentive for rooftop solar power, the Trump administration moved to eliminate the legal justification that allows the U.S. to regulate greenhouse gases altogether.

While Congress made sweeping changes to the economy through the Republican tax law, the Trump administration made policy changes that will touch the lives of regular people. It ended a federal program that allowed people to file their taxes for free. It undid a rule that would have limited overdraft banking fees to $5. And it threatened the future of the Gateway project, a lifeline for passenger and freight rail in the Northeast.

“The first thing that comes to mind is Trump’s decision with respect to the Gateway tunnel,” Rep. Nellie Pou (D-9th), reflecting Trump’s second term so far, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “That’s a huge, monumental problem for us.”

During his first term, Trump threatened to launch a barrage of tariffs – taxes on imported goods, passed on to the public. But his economic advisors generally talked him out of it. That was not the case in 2025.

Last year, in an effort to take back wealth “stolen” from the U.S., Trump, who as president can unilaterally impose or end tariffs, issued a barrage of tariffs on countries worldwide that cost the average U.S. household $1,200, according to research Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee, an arm of Congress, released last year.

“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. The tariffs and rising health care costs, after Congress declined to extend subsidies for the 2010 health law known as Obamacare, dominated last year, Gottheimer said.

“There’s nothing that hasn’t been impacted by that,” he said of Trump’s tariff agenda.

Premiums for New Jersey patients covered in the 2010 law will rise an average of 15.9% this year, from 2025 prices, according to state officials. Members of Congress are trying to find a way to extend the subsidies for the health law, a path to passage is hazy.

Perhaps the most striking changes with Trump back in Washington for New Jersey, where about 25% percent of residents were born in another country, came on immigration policy.

The administration moved hundreds of thousands of people through the federal immigration detention system last year and shows no signs of stopping.

The White House is eyeing Roxbury Township in Morris County for a possible new detention center, in addition to the use of a military base in South Jersey to hold then deport immigrants.

Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies. “We can’t let them forget that we did such a great job on the border.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/11/donald-trump-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:56:58.255308

""The residents putting their personal safety on the line to observe ICE agents and their activities are keeping us safe.","The city of Minneapolis had been preparing for a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as Donald Trump's blitz on Democratic strongholds rolled out across the country.

Operation Metro Surge began in the city in December, but escalated a few days ago with an influx of federal agents to Minneapolis neighbourhoods.

Like in Los Angeles and Washington DC, ordinary citizens and local organisers have formed networks of those who want ICE gone and who are wiling to help.

They patrol the streets too, warning neighbourhoods of incoming ICE raids, documenting what happens and sometimes offering legal advice to those targeted.

Now, a US citizen has been fatally shot by an ICE agent, and according to a local council member and the area's congressional representative, that person was one of the legal observers, who usually operate in a volunteer capacity.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, has been identified as the victim.

Local councillor and an organiser of these civilian resistance networks Jason Chavez said Ms Good was ""out in our community because of the care and love"" for immigrant neighbours.

""We have a variety of community responders on the ground watching ICE agents, helping families with rent, food, watching our neighbourhoods, making sure that we can keep our neighbourhoods safe and make sure that immigration enforcement isn't splitting our families apart,"" he told local media.

""Making sure that they can alert and blow a whistle whenever ICE is near so their neighbours know what is happening.""

Minneapolis is a sanctuary city, which means the local authorities do little to enforce federal immigration laws. Los Angeles, New York and Chicago are also sanctuary cities.

Local media is reporting that for nearly a year, migrant rights and neighbourhood advocates and activists across the Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and the neighbouring St Paul are known, have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge.

From places of worship to caravan parks, these organisers have set up very active online networks.

They reportedly scan licence plates to identify possible federal vehicles, and hand out whistles to sound a warning of any enforcement presence.

They are connected in chat groups, have code names and two-way radios and use their own cars. Some have legal training, others volunteer their time, effort and smartphones to document what they see in case it might be of legal significance down the line.

In blue cities, when federal agents sent by Donald Trump's administration are on the streets, there will very likely be someone from one of these networks around the corner, too.

In August, the ABC spent an evening inside one of these networks in operation in and around Washington DC as National Guard troops and federal agents patrolled the city.

'We are trying to get there as quickly as possible'

With her car and her phone, Anna, who asked for her real name not to be used, was dedicating several weeknights to patrol the streets of Washington DC, just as National Troops and several federal agencies were.

She worked as a full-time teacher outside the nation's capital during the day, then made her way into the city come nightfall.

""Sometimes maybe 2 hours will go by and nothing will happen and we're just sitting around and we're watching and we're waiting and then sometimes we will realise 40, 50 … police officers are being called to the scene of a simple fight,"" she told the ABC in August when Washington DC was the focus of Donald Trump's crackdown.

""And we're wondering why so many cops are being called to one area.

""So we're basically just trying to go around and get footage and ask questions about everything that's happening because it all feels very performative.

""It feels that this is all supposed to be a big display of a show of force even for things that normally would be a much smaller situation or offence, so we're just trying to get that on film and ask questions and do our due diligence.""

In August, the ABC witnessed Anna and others as they received tip-offs about where law enforcement was suspected to be active that night. In a convoy, they'd travel to that location and start filming.

She said, ""details and context are incredibly important"".

""We need to be vigilant about what the story actually is. We are trying to get there as quickly as possible to see exactly what happened,"" she said.

""It's a community and we're all giving pieces of detail, that are all part of the big puzzle that's being put together that makes it more informative for the entire public. We're all trying to piece the picture together,"" she said.

""We're all trying to help and make it so we know what's going on in our city and our communities.""

In Minneapolis, there are competing narratives about what happened in the lead-up to the death of Ms Good.

Donald Trump claims the victim was a ""professional agitator"". Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X that the ICE officer began firing after a ""violent rioter"".

Some of the other claims coming from federal authorities include that the victim tried to run over ICE agents and that the officers acted defensively.

But with so many people present at the scene of the enforcement activity, there are several videos of the incident taken from multiple angles that will allow the world and any potential investigators to see and judge the shooting for themselves.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has been scathing, saying: ""They're already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence… having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly — that is bullshit.""

The fatal shooting happened just blocks from where an officer of the Minneapolis Police Department murdered black man George Floyd in May 2020.

Observing ICE actions 'not a crime'

Local councillor Chavez had been putting a call-out on his Facebook page for several days ahead of the shooting, asking community members to join the observer networks.

Since the shooting, he has posted several times saying: ""Observing the federal government's actions at 34th and Portland is not a crime, and even if it were, it would not be punishable by death.""

""The deceased should be with us today, but because these masked agents believe they are above the law, [the victim was] murdered for exercising their rights.

""The residents putting their personal safety on the line to observe ICE agents and their activities are keeping us safe. They're documenting the government's criminal activities, driving our friends and family to work or school, and they're providing mutual aid.""

Democratic congressional representative for Minnesota Ilhan Omar said: ""For weeks, ICE's so-called 'Operation Metro Surge' has spread fear, chaos and violence across our state.""

""ICE's actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible. I am beyond outraged that their reckless, callous actions led to the killing of a legal observer in Minneapolis,"" she said.

Just two days ago, the White House issued an update on Operation Metro Surge, saying: ""The streets of Minneapolis are safer today thanks to the hard work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and their federal partners.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0a9d2f5dd9984dd543467764df7d1e39?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1774&cropW=3153&xPos=0&yPos=164&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-08 02:57:28.714657

People protest as law enforcement officers attend to the scene of the shooting involving federal law enforcement agents, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis.
The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly.","Court records show that Renee Nicole Macklin Good had previously been married to a man named Timmy Ray Macklin, who died in 2023 at age 36.

The man’s father, Timmy Ray Macklin Sr., told the Minnesota Star Tribune that his son and Macklin Good had a child together who is now 6 years old.

“There’s nobody else in his life,” Macklin Sr. told the paper.

Donna Ganger, the deceased woman’s mother, told the newspaper that the family was notified of the death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid” that she was killed, Ganger told the newspaper. “She was probably terrified.”

Asked about protesters challenging ICE officers, Ganger said her daughter was “not part of anything like that at all.”

A hospital record obtained by The Associated Press identified the woman as 37-year-old Renae Macklin-Good, though business records spelled her name as Renee Nicole Macklin Good.

In social media accounts, Macklin Good said she was a “Poet and writer and wife and mom” originally from Colorado but “experiencing Minnesota.” A profile picture shows her smiling and holding a young child against her cheek.

In a video from the scene of the shooting posted to social media, a distraught woman is seen sitting near the vehicle crying, describing Macklin Good as her spouse and that they had a 6-year-old child.

“That’s my wife, I don’t know what to do!” wailed the woman, who wasn’t identified.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening.

“Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he’s been taught to do in that situation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening.

Noem alleged that the woman who was killed was trying to block officers with her vehicle, had been harassing them through the day and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over” before she was shot.

“We’ll let the FBI continue the investigation to get it resolved,” she said, adding that the officer was hit by the vehicle, taken to a hospital and released.

Noem added that immigration enforcement has made over 1,500 arrests in Minnesota in recent weeks.

Black Visions, a Black Lives Matter-affiliated group in Minneapolis, said the killing was “the outcome of escalating state violence fueled by raids, fear, and the criminalization of immigrant life.”

“Our communities have been sounding the alarm, and today that violence turned deadly,” reads a statement posted to a Facebook account for the group, which was involved in organizing protests after the police murder of George Floyd in 2020.

“We will not normalize this violence,” it continued. “Our greatest resistance has always been our love and care for one another. They cannot defeat us.”

The Rev. Ingrid Rasmussen, a pastor of nearby Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, said she and other clergy, wearing their stoles and collars, are there “to be in community with a neighborhood that’s hurting and a city that feels under siege.”

Rasmussen, who had opened her church to the community during the protests and rioting after the killing of George Floyd, said she hoped violence wouldn’t happen again, but blamed federal law enforcement activities like Wednesday’s shooting for inciting it.

“We are all gathered around our own grief,” she said.

Lynette Reini-Grandell, 65, had already heard that ICE agents were in her neighborhood when she saw the chaotic scene, one car askew in a lane and ICE vehicles backed up behind it.

She said she tried to figure out what was going on when several gunshots rang out and the car that was askew crashed to a stop.

“She was driving away and they killed her,” said Reini-Grandell of the motorist.

Reini-Grandell said she started recording ICE officers approach the woman’s vehicle and kept a close watch as law enforcement told bystanders to stand back.

“I didn’t want to get shot or chemical sprayed,” she said. “I was much calmer when it was happening than I am now.”

The Department of Justice says in its Justice Manual that firearms should not be used simply to disable a moving vehicle.

The policy allows deadly force only in limited circumstances, such as when someone in the vehicle is threatening another person with deadly force, or when the vehicle itself is being used in a way that poses an imminent risk and no reasonable alternative exists, including moving out of the vehicle’s path.

Police training experts have told The Associated Press that officers are generally taught not to step in front of moving vehicles to try to block them.

Training also emphasizes weighing the totality of the situation, including whether the person involved poses an immediate danger and whether the underlying allegation involves violence.

Many department policies specifically bar firing at vehicles just to stop a fleeing suspect.

Some policing experts say the rules need flexibility, pointing to cases in which people have used vehicles as weapons, including attacks in recent years where cars were driven into crowds.

The debate has been sharpened by high-profile cases, including a 2023 shooting in Ohio in which an officer fired through a windshield in a grocery store parking lot while investigating a shoplifting allegation, killing the pregnant motorist. The officer was later charged and acquitted.

For decades, police departments across the U.S. have limited when officers are allowed to fire at moving vehicles, citing the danger to bystanders and the risk that a driver who is shot will lose control.

The New York Police Department was among the first major agencies to adopt those limits. The department barred officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car and sparked protests.

Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s later found that the policy, along with other use-of-force restrictions, helped reduce bystanders being struck by police gunfire and led to fewer deaths in police shootings.

Over the years, many law enforcement agencies followed New York’s lead. Policing organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended similar limits, warning that shooting at vehicles creates serious risks from stray gunfire or from a vehicle crashing if the driver is hit.

Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O’Hara didn’t say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.

“At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

The governor said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He also said that like many, he is outraged about the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” But he called for calm.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference.

“If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”

The president, in a social media post, said he’d viewed video footage of the incident and criticized the woman who was shot as acting “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and “then violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer.

The president also described another woman seen screaming in the footage of the incident he viewed as “obviously, a professional agitator.”

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said of the ICE officer.

“The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.”

In October, a Chicago woman was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in a similar incident involving a vehicle, though she survived.

Almost immediately, Homeland Security officials issued a statement labeling Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, as a “domestic terrorist” who had “ambushed” and “rammed” agents with her vehicle.

She was charged in federal court with assaulting a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

But federal prosecutors were later forced to dismiss the case against Martinez before trial after security camera video and body cam footage emerged that her defense lawyers said undermined the official narrative.

The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez’s truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said.

Text messages showed the federal agent bragging about his marksmanship after the shooting.

“I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes,” read a text message that the agent, Charles Exum, sent to colleagues. “Put that in your book boys.” Twenty-four hours after the shooting, Exum texted, “Cool, I’m up for another round.”

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine,” Walz wrote on X, responding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s post alleging that a woman had “weaponized her vehicle” before she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” wrote the governor.

Major protests and rioting erupted in 2020 after Floyd’s death, damaging many businesses that have struggled to recover.

Public safety in the area has long been under scrutiny as well — most recently in November, when a Minneapolis city council member, Jamal Osman, parked just a couple of blocks away from the area, was robbed and his vehicle stolen by suspects he was told had carjacked another person earlier that evening.

Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, says it was carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Mayor Frey blasted that characterization as well as the federal deployment in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said.

The location is just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

The crowd vented its anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that harkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago immigration crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

That’s according to a statement from department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A federal officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist when she allegedly tried to run over law enforcement officers during an immigration crackdown in the city, authorities said Wednesday.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot and killed a motorist acted recklessly. Fry rejected federal officials’ claims that the officer had acted in self-defense.

During a news conference hours after the ICE officer shot the woman, whose name hasn’t been released, an angry Frey blasted the federal immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets and in this case quite literally killing people.”

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the city’s oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her death quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor added.

Videos taken by bystanders from different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the SUV moves towards him.

It was not clear from the videos whether the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked at the kerb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they had seen.

After the shooting, emergency medical technicians attempted to administer aid to the woman.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy,” Jacobson said. “Any speculation about what has happened would be just that.”

The shooting occurred in the district of Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, who described it as “state violence”, not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighbourhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have built extensive online networks, scanned licence plates for suspected federal vehicles, and stocked whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert communities to any enforcement presence.

The backstory:

An ICE agent fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning.

Federal officials are claiming the agent acted in self-defense, but Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is calling ""bullshit"" on that claim.The shooting happened around 9:30 a.m. in the area of East 34th Street and Portland Avenue. The woman died at the hospital.

Witnesses told FOX 9, a woman got into a red vehicle and there was one ICE agent on either side of the vehicle trying to get in, and a third ICE agent came and tried to yank on the driver's side door.

One of the agents on the driver's side door then backed away, and then opened fire, shooting three times through the driver's side window, witnesses said.

One witness claimed that the vehicle wasn't moving toward the agents. However, federal officials said ICE officers were ""conducting targeted operations"" when ""rioters"" blocked officers. One of the ""rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

Officials said an ICE officer who was ""fearing for his life"" fired ""defensive shots"" to save himself and his officers, killing the woman.

A video of the shooting shows a red Honda Pilot blocking the roadway as an ICE squad approaches. When agents approach the vehicle, the Pilot attempts to drive away, moving towards an agent. When that happens, the agent fires three shots at the driver. Police say the driver was struck in the head.

President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies, and commissions, following his administration's review of participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House release.

Most of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor, migration and other issues the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and ""woke"" initiatives. Other non-U.N. organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Global Counterterrorism Forum.

""The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.

U.S. builds on pattern of exiting global agencies

The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. It has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies it believes align with Trump's agenda and those that no longer serve U.S. interests.

""I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is 'my way or the highway,'"" said Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group. ""It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington's own terms.""

It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations — both Republican and Democratic — have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.

Many independent nongovernmental agencies — some that work with the United Nations — have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Despite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The latest global organizations the U.S. is departing

The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.

UNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump — who calls climate change a hoax — withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.

Gina McCarthy, former White House National Climate Adviser, said being the only country in the world not part of the treaty is ""shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision.""

""This Administration is forfeiting our country's ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies, and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country,"" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement.

Mainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.

The U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it ""gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.

It will also be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.

The U.N. Population Fund, the agency providing sexual and reproductive health worldwide, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition, and Trump cut funding for it during his first term. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in ""coercive abortion practices"" in countries like China.

When President Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support GOP claims.

Other organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5694x3201+0+512/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2F29%2Fe58fcb064f8eb472315e6c4d4421%2Fap25343442464463.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 00:57:02.011108

During a news conference hours after the ICE officer shot the woman, an angry Frey blasted the federal immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown in a major U.S. city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city’s mayor described as “reckless” and unnecessary.

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him. It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of a series of immigration enforcement operations in major U.S. cities under the Trump administration. The killing was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns in a handful of states since 2024.

What federal policy says about shooting at vehicles

The Department of Justice says in its Justice Manual that firearms should not be used simply to disable a moving vehicle.

The policy allows deadly force only in limited circumstances, such as when someone in the vehicle is threatening another person with deadly force, or when the vehicle itself is being used in a way that poses an imminent risk and no reasonable alternative exists, including moving out of the vehicle’s path.

Police training experts have told The Associated Press that officers are generally taught not to step in front of moving vehicles to try to block them.

Related: DHS deploys 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis area to carry out ‘largest immigration operation ever’

Training also emphasizes weighing the totality of the situation, including whether the person involved poses an immediate danger and whether the underlying allegation involves violence.

Many department policies specifically bar firing at vehicles just to stop a fleeing suspect.

Some policing experts say the rules need flexibility, pointing to cases in which people have used vehicles as weapons, including attacks in recent years where cars were driven into crowds.

The debate has been sharpened by high-profile cases, including a 2023 shooting in Ohio in which an officer fired through a windshield in a grocery store parking lot while investigating a shoplifting allegation, killing the pregnant motorist. The officer was later charged and acquitted.

Why many police agencies limit shooting at moving vehicles

For decades, police departments across the U.S. have limited when officers are allowed to fire at moving vehicles, citing the danger to bystanders and the risk that a driver who is shot will lose control.

The New York Police Department was among the first major agencies to adopt those limits. The department barred officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car and sparked protests.

Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s later found that the policy, along with other use-of-force restrictions, helped reduce bystanders being struck by police gunfire and led to fewer deaths in police shootings.

Over the years, many law enforcement agencies followed New York’s lead. Policing organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended similar limits, warning that shooting at vehicles creates serious risks from stray gunfire or from a vehicle crashing if the driver is hit.

Minneapolis Police chief gives no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone

Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O’Hara didn’t say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. … At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,” the chief said.

“At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

Walz calls on protesters to remain peaceful

The governor said he’s prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He also said that like many, he is outraged about the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable.” But he called for calm.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said during a news conference.

“If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do. We can’t give them what they want.”

Trump says the ICE officer who fatally shot the motorist appears to have been acting in self-defense

The president, in a social media post, said he’d viewed video footage of the incident and criticized the woman who was shot as acting “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting” and “then violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer.

The president also described another woman seen screaming in the footage of the incident he viewed as “obviously, a professional agitator.”

“Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,” Trump said of the ICE officer.

“The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.”

A vigil is planned for the woman killed

An immigrant rights group says on Facebook that it will hold a vigil for the woman who was shot.

“We witnessed an atrocious attack on our community today,” read the post from the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. “Community members were taken from us and an observer was shot dead. ICE OUT OF MINNESOTA NOW.”

Why is the Minneapolis area the target of what immigration enforcement describes as its largest operation?

Minnesota initially grabbed President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ attention over a series of fraud cases where many of the defendants had roots in Somalia. Prosecutors say that billions of dollars were stolen from federally funded health care benefits and a COVID-19 program in recent years.

Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., a group Trump called “garbage” in December and said he didn’t want them in the country.

The president has also criticized Democratic Gov. Walz for failing to catch the alleged crimes.

Late last month, a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming that a day care center in Minneapolis run by Somali residents had taken over $100 million in fraud. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel then posted on social media about increased operations in the city partly targeting, as Patel put it, “large-scale fraud schemes.”

On Tuesday, DHS said it planned to deploy 2,000 federal agents and officers to the Minneapolis area.

Chicago experienced a similar incident during immigration crackdown

In October, a Chicago woman was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in a similar incident involving a vehicle, though she survived.

Almost immediately, Homeland Security officials issued a statement labeling Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old teaching assistant at a Montessori school, as a “domestic terrorist” who had “ambushed” and “rammed” agents with her vehicle.

She was charged in federal court with assaulting a federal officer, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. But federal prosecutors were later forced to dismiss the case against Martinez before trial after security camera video and bodycam footage emerged that her defense lawyers said undermined the official narrative.

The videos showed a Border Patrol agent steering his vehicle into Martinez’s truck, rather than the other way around, her attorney said.

Gov. Tim Walz calls Homeland Security’s claims in the Minnesota shooting ‘propaganda’

“I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine,” Walz wrote on X, responding to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s post alleging that a woman had “weaponized her vehicle” before she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,” wrote the governor.

County attorney’s office says investigation must play out before any decision made on charges

Daniel Borgertpoepping, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, says that “We have jurisdiction to bring charges, as do the feds.

“It’s a little bit of a complicated interplay but the bottom line is yes, we have jurisdiction to bring criminal charges.”

Homeland Security secretary describes the incident as an ‘act of domestic terrorism’

Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, says it was carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

But Mayor Frey blasted that characterization as well as the federal deployment in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said.

Shooting occurred in modest neighborhood not far from where George Floyd was killed

The location is just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

Frey demands ICE leave Minneapolis

The mayor says in a social media post that immigration agents are “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey said.

A large throng of protesters gather at the scene after the shooting

The crowd vented its anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that harkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago immigration crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

Department of Homeland Security says an ICE officer shot the woman in a residential neighborhood

That’s according to a statement from department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

According to sister station KMBC, Minneapolis City Council members identified the victim as Renee Nicole Good, describing her as a “member of our community.”

Donna Ganger, her mother, also identified her to local media in Minneapolis. Good had a 6-year old child, her mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Good described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” who was from Colorado.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

It’s not clear where Good resided at the time of the shooting, but court records in Jackson County, Missouri, show that her name was connected to an address in Kansas City in 2023. The vehicle involved in the incident was also registered in Kansas City, Missouri, according to KMBC, which confirmed this through vehicle records from a federally recognized source.

It is not clear in the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer and there is no indication of whether or not the woman had interactions with ICE officers before the videos started. After the shooting, the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop.

In another video taken at the scene, a woman, who described Macklin Good as her spouse, is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who was not identified, said the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.”

In a social media post, President Donald Trump made similar accusations against the woman and defended ICE’s work.

Local officials dispute the narrative

Noem claimed the woman was part of a “mob of agitators” and said the officer followed his training. She said the veteran officer who fired his gun had been rammed and dragged by an anti-ICE motorist in June.

“Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that in this situation, it was preventable,” Noem said, adding that the FBI would investigate.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Noem's version of what happened as “garbage” and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on the immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is (expletive),” the mayor said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone.

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who shot the driver. Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state authorities would investigate the shooting with federal authorities.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,” Jacobson told reporters.

The shooting happened in the district of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it “state violence,” not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.",https://compote.slate.com/images/76841c9c-ad18-43a1-b1dd-eb8080548632.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-08 00:57:05.386285

By asserting the absolute litigation privilege where appropriate, litigants can avoid unnecessary and costly litigation.","In American Backflow & Fire Prevention, Inc. v. Hincks et al, 2025 IL App (1st) 250023, the Illinois Appellate Court, Second District, affirmed the dismissal of claims arising from allegedly defamatory statements made to the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET), and the Illinois State Fire Marshal. The Appellate Court held that the statements were protected by Illinois’s absolute litigation privilege and reaffirmed that this privilege applies broadly to communications made before, during, or after judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings and specifically applies to complaints made to certification bodies, such as the ASSE and the NICET.

Background & Procedural Posture

The plaintiffs – a fire protection company and its owner – sued union representatives, a former employee, and counsel, alleging a coordinated campaign to interfere with their business and damage their reputation through complaints to the ASSE, NICET, and the Illinois State Fire Marshal. These complaints challenged whether plaintiffs and their employees had sufficient field experience for ASSE and NICET credentials and alleged that plaintiffs had fraudulently documented their work experience.

Plaintiffs asserted an array of claims—tortious interference with economic advantage, tortious interference with contract, defamation, defamation per se, violations of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (815 ILCS 510/1 et seq), and civil conspiracy—seeking nearly $934,000 in damages. Defendants moved to dismiss under 735 ILCS 5/2‑619(a)(9), invoking the absolute litigation privilege. The circuit court (Lake County) dismissed plaintiffs’ Complaint in its entirety, and the Second District affirmed.

The Court’s Analysis

The court’s analysis centered on Illinois’s expansive application of the absolute litigation privilege. The court reaffirmed that the privilege applies broadly to communications made before, during, or after judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, and even to statements by non-parties, so long as they are pertinent to the matter at hand. Motive is irrelevant, and any doubts about pertinency are resolved in favor of applying the privilege.

To determine whether ASSE and NICET qualified as quasi-judicial bodies, the court applied the six-factor test from Kalish v. Illinois Education Ass’n, 157 Ill. App. 3d 969, 971–72 (1987). The test considers whether the entity has the power to: (1) exercise judgment and discretion; (2) ascertain facts and decide; (3) make binding orders; (4) affect personal or property rights; (5) examine witnesses, compel their attendance, and conduct hearings; and (6) enforce decisions or impose penalties.

The court found that ASSE and NICET satisfied at least five of these factors. Both organizations investigate complaints, exercise discretion in determining whether to revoke certifications, conduct hearings with rights to counsel and witnesses, issue binding decisions on certification status, and impose penalties by revoking credentials. Although they lack subpoena power, the presence of these other powers was sufficient for the court to conclude that ASSE and NICET function as quasi-judicial bodies, triggering the absolute litigation privilege for statements made in connection with their proceedings.

The court further concluded that defendants’ statements were related to the quasi-judicial proceedings they were submitted through each entity’s formal complaint process and specifically questioned plaintiffs’ qualifications for the ASSE and NICET certifications. Even though defendants were not parties to the proceeding, their statements concerned the same subject matter and were necessary to initiate the quasi-judicial proceeding and therefore met the pertinency requirement and are thus protected by the absolute litigation privilege.

The court also found two alternative bases to support the application of the absolute litigation privilege: the statements were made in anticipation of enforcement actions under the Fire Sprinkler Contractor Licensing Act and were related to ongoing NLRB proceedings.

Finally, the court held that, while the plaintiffs brought claims other than defamation, the absolute litigation privilege extended to all claims because they arose from the same allegedly defamatory statements and were merely attempts to recast their defamation claims to avoid the protection afforded by the privilege.

Key Takeaways

This decision reinforces Illinois’s expansive view of the absolute litigation privilege and further clarifies that it can apply to communications with private certification or licensing bodies, even when the speaker is not a party to the proceeding.

Within hours of a Minnesota protester being fatally shot after allegedly attempting to run over ICE agents, a familiar network of far-left protesters for causes ranging from communism to climate change mobilized across the country.

The deceased, identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by the Minneapolis City Council on Wednesday afternoon, was killed at the wheel of her SUV just after 11 a.m. ET.

Federal authorities said she had tried to run over ICE agents who were part of a 2,000-strong team sent to the Twin Cities to round up and deport illegal immigrant criminals.

""This appears to be an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference late Wednesday in Minneapolis. ""The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Good was shot in the head, and later pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center.

""I have just viewed the [video] clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense.""

Almost immediately, various groups with causes as diverse as socialism, communism, climate change, Palestinian rights and the Democratic Party launched what seemed to be coordinated protests online and in American streets, using similar language.

The effort by left-wing groups with no obvious shared cause echoed protests over the weekend, when many of the same groups sprang into action in the hours following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

""It's the same network of people that have thousands of Americans blocking the streets, waving communist and terrorist flags and attacking law enforcement and innocents,"" said Brandy Shufutinsky, director of the Education and National Security Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""They are stoking the grievance industry that they built.""

While authorities said an investigation was underway, the protest groups were quick to brand the killing a murder. A sentiment analysis of relevant social media posts by left-wing groups showed the graphic and emotional language used in the posts was designed to provoke moral outrage and mobilize people to take to the streets. For example, posts told people to ""get in the streets now,"" ""hit the streets"" and ""get to the White House ASAP.""

""EMERGENCY ALERT. THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT!"" wrote 50551 on Instagram at 11:50 a.m.

The UNFCCC treaty forms the bedrock of international cooperation to deal with the climate crisis and has been agreed to by every country in the world since its inception 34 years ago.
“This is a shortsighted, embarrassing and foolish decision,” said Gina McCarthy, who was a top climate adviser to Joe Biden’s White House.
“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate change leadership and global collaboration.
The climate crisis is, in fact, a matter of scientific consensus and is already taking a measurable and growing toll upon economies and people’s lives.","Donald Trump has sparked outrage by announcing the US will exit the foundational international agreement to address the climate crisis, cementing the US’s utter isolation from the global effort to confront dangerously escalating temperatures.

In a presidential memorandum issued on Wednesday, Trump withdrew from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions, calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States”.

The UNFCCC treaty forms the bedrock of international cooperation to deal with the climate crisis and has been agreed to by every country in the world since its inception 34 years ago. The US Senate ratified the treaty in October 1992.

Trump has, however, routinely ridiculed climate science as a “scam” and a “hoax” and has actively hobbled clean energy projects and other climate policies as president, attempting to force the US and other countries to stay wedded to the fossil fuels that are driving disastrous heatwaves, storms, droughts and conflicts that imperils billions of people around the world.

“This is a shortsighted, embarrassing and foolish decision,” said Gina McCarthy, who was a top climate adviser to Joe Biden’s White House.

“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate change leadership and global collaboration. This administration is forfeiting our country’s ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country.”

Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump’s decision to exit the UNFCCC is an “unforced error” and “self-defeating” as it will further hamper the US’s ability to compete with China, which is increasingly dominant in the world’s burgeoning clean energy technology industries.

“While the Trump administration is abdicating the United States of America’s global leadership, the rest of the world is continuing to shift to cleaner power sources and take climate action,” Bapna said.

“The Trump administration is ceding the trillions of dollars in investment that the clean energy transition brings to nations willing to follow the science and embrace the cleanest, cheapest sources of energy.”

Underscoring the administration’s hostility to any measure to deal with a climate that is now hotter than at any point in human civilization, the White House memo also states that the US will pull out from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top climate science body, as well as an assortment of other international environmental organizations, including the International Renewable Energy Association, the International Solar Alliance and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Last year, Trump said the US would exit the Paris climate deal, in which countries agreed to limit dangerous global heating, while the administration also declined to send a delegation to UN climate talks in Brazil.

As the UNFCCC treaty was ratified by the Senate, it is unclear whether Trump can unilaterally scrap it, or whether a future president will be able to rejoin the framework without a further Senate vote. “Letting this lawless move stand could shut the US out of climate diplomacy forever,” said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said in a statement that the agreements jettisoned by the administration on Wednesday are “often dominated by progressive ideology and detached from national interests”.

The climate crisis is, in fact, a matter of scientific consensus and is already taking a measurable and growing toll upon economies and people’s lives. In the US, record numbers of major extreme weather disasters are forcing insurers to flee states, undermining the country’s property market. Scientists have warned that global temperatures are set to breach previously agreed thresholds, which will trigger further worsened calamities.

“On the one-year anniversary of the wildfires that stole dozens of lives, thousands of homes and the sense of safety for millions as it reduced Los Angeles communities to ash, Trump is making it clear he has no interest in protecting Americans from the rapidly increasing impacts on our health and safety of the worsening climate crisis,” said Loren Blackford, executive director of the Sierra Club. “This is not leadership. It is cowardice.”

Al Gore, the former US vice-president and climate activist, told the Guardian: “The Trump Administration has been turning its back on the climate crisis since day one, removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, dismantling America’s scientific infrastructure, curbing access to greenhouse gas emissions data, and ending essential investments in the clean energy transition.”

“They’ve done this at the behest of the oil industry, so that billionaires can rake in even more money while polluting our planet and endangering people in America and around the world,” Gore said.

Other organizations and agencies that the US will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

Tennessee and federal authorities have given conflicting narratives of what happened the morning of Jan. 7.

Before the shooting, the woman, who has not yet been identified, was reportedly observing immigration enforcement activities as agents surged into the city in what the federal government described as the ""largest immigration operation ever.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has described the woman's actions as an ""act of domestic terrorism,"" saying the agent ""fired defensive shots"" after the woman allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle,"" and attempted to ram officers with it.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey disputed those claims at a news conference, saying videos show the woman driving away from federal agents, not toward them. Minneapolis authorities have said the woman was in her vehicle blocking the road when a federal officer approached her on foot. When she began to drive off, at least two shots were fired and the vehicle crashed on the side of the road.

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota, described the woman as a ""legal observer,"" and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. said the woman was a U.S. citizen.

The Minneapolis City Council identified the 37-year-old woman shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday as Renee Nicole Good.

""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government,"" the city council said in a statement. NPR member station MPR News has reached out to a family member of the woman.

A post on an Instagram account that appears to belong to Good states she was a “poet and writer and wife and mom and s***** guitar strummer from Colorado; experiencing Minneapolis, MN,” according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.

The shooting occurred on a residential street in south Minneapolis — less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. ICE agents were conducting targeted immigration enforcement operations at the time, according to Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

“Renee was brutally killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent, leaving behind a child. Her killing is inexcusable and the direct result of an agency that, under Donald Trump, has become an unrestrained paramilitary force: increasingly aggressive, hostile, unaccountable and detached from basic standards of public safety,” Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib said in a statement. “No federal agency should be allowed to operate above the law, and no federal agent should be able to patrol our streets with masks and zero accountability for introducing violence and heartbreak to our neighborhoods.”

Federal and local officials dispute the circumstances that led to the shooting.

NPR has reviewed multiple videos of the shooting taken from different vantage points and posted to social media. The footage shows multiple officers near an SUV stopped in the middle of the road. One officer demands the driver exit the vehicle and grabs the car handle. The SUV reverses, then begins to drive forward, which is when a different officer near the front of the car pulls his weapon and fires into the vehicle. Three gunshots are heard as the firing officer backs away from the SUV. Moments later, the vehicle crashes.

The incident has further inflamed tensions between the Trump administration and Minneapolis, which has been the target of a large-scale immigration crackdown. Local officials said they expect protests to follow and urged residents to remain peaceful.

At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was prepared to mobilize the state National Guard if necessary.

""They want a show. We can't give it to them,"" he said. ""We can't give them what they want.""

Federal and local officials clash over the shooting

In a statement, DHS spokesperson McLaughlin asserted that the motorist ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them."" She added that the ICE officer who pulled the trigger was ""fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public.""

An eyewitness told MPR News that ICE agents gave conflicting orders to a driver in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, with one agent ordering her to drive away from the scene where an ICE vehicle was stuck in a snowbank while another yelled for her to get out of her car as he reached for the door handle.

The scene ended with an agent shooting into the car, killing the woman.

Caitlin Callenson said she was walking down Portland Avenue with her partner when she saw what she assumed were Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“They tried to zoom their car out of the snowbank but were just stuck,” she said.

She said other ICE vehicles showed up, leading neighbors to believe it might be an ICE enforcement action. People showed up, and some began blowing whistles.

“People in our neighborhood have been terrorized by ICE for six weeks. We want our neighbors safe, and so when we see a group of ICE vehicles, people in the community are showing up and saying, ‘This is not OK,’” she said.

Upon reviewing a video of the incident, President Trump said he also believes the shooting was an act of self-defense.

""The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

But local leaders have raised concerns about the Trump administration's account of the shooting.

At a fiery press conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey accused ICE of ""trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull***. ""

""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,"" he added.

The mayor called on ICE agents to leave the city, asserting that federal immigration authorities were ripping families apart and sowing chaos on Minneapolis streets.

Gov. Walz wrote on X that he has seen video of the shooting and told the public: ""Don't believe this propaganda machine.""

""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,"" he added.

Minneapolis police chief says he's 'very concerned' about use of deadly force

At a press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said local police arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound to the head. They performed life-saving measures at the scene, including CPR. The woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he added.

Preliminary information, according to O'Hara, indicated that the woman was in her vehicle and blocking the road on Portland Avenue between 33rd and 34th St.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,"" he said, adding that the car then crashed on the side of the roadway.

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents. He noted that the use of deadly force is justified at times, but that most law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are trained to minimize the risks and the need for deadly force.

""In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle of someone who's not armed,"" he said.

The shooting is being investigated by the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. They will investigate the use of deadly force.

Today’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer has increased tensions in Minneapolis after weeks of strain from immigration enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.","A woman with blood covering her face sat in the yard of Minneapolis resident Tyrice Jones’ home following the fatal ICE shooting of a woman this morning, Jones said, and was heard shouting, “You guys just killed my wife!”

Jones, 35, was in an upstairs apartment when he heard gunshots and a crash, prompting him to come outside and see the SUV driven by Renee Nicole Good had smashed into a streetlight directly in front of his building, he said.

He told the woman to call “her people,” to which she replied, “We have nobody out here. We’re from out of town,” said Jones, who said no one offered the woman medical aid. The woman later gave her black lab to a bystander and people in a group chat were attempting to find her so they could return her dog, he added.

The resident of Portland Avenue then captured video showing the immediate aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting, including agents at the driver’s seat assessing the situation and bystanders berating the agents for shooting the driver.

Jones said agents took the woman driver’s body out of the crashed car and set her on the ground, after which he saw four or five people carry her body by the arms and legs to the end of the block and set her on the ground until an ambulance arrived.

The scene where Renee Nicole Good was shot by an ICE agent is “very calm” now, a stark contrast to the moments of anger directed at police officers earlier, CNN law enforcement correspondent Whitney Wild said.

“It is completely quiet because this is steps from where this woman lost her life,” said Wild, reporting on the ground, describing it as a “moment of real reverence.”

She pointed to a growing memorial site with hundreds of candles and bouquets of flowers dedicated to the 37-year-old woman.

“All these people here are taking a moment to look at this vigil, reflect on her life, reflect on what this moment means,” she said. “This is just so striking. This is right where she spent her last moments.”

It’s a departure from earlier when an angry crowd confronted Minneapolis police officers, yelling and throwing snowballs at them, she said.

“It was a really striking moment … because Minneapolis police were taking that heat from the public for something that they were not involved in. And yet the public felt like they were where they were going to direct their anger,” she said.

Out of an abundance of caution to quell any potential unruly crowds overnight, Minneapolis police have requested mutual aid resources from the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Department as well as state police to be available in the area, a law enforcement source tells CNN.

The Minneapolis Police Department has also canceled days off for officers and recalled all sworn law enforcement officers to be available for assignment if needed. The source noted there is no indication violence will occur, but law enforcement resources are being staged out of an abundance of caution.

Speaking with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday night, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed his department will be at an elevated state of readiness throughout the night with additional resources on standby.

A witness to the fatal ICE shooting of a woman in a vehicle said she did not appear to be driving aggressively, calling the incident “an unnecessary use of force in a reaction to imagined danger.”

Trevor Heitkamp disputed the Department of Homeland Security’s claims the agent fired his weapon in self-defense, aligning with state and local officials. The Minneapolis resident was in front of his house when he started to hear the incident unfold down the street, prompting him to record a video.

As he got closer, Heitkamp said a red SUV was turned “mostly sideways in the road” to obstruct ICE agents, who shouted at the driver to move the car, he told CNN. “The car backed up slowly and proceeded to pull forward pretty slowly,” while witnesses shouted in protest, he said.

That vehicle then crashed into a nearby car when the ICE agent put his weapon back into its holster, Heitkamp said. The agents on scene were shouting, “No pulse!” when a man who identified himself as a physician told the officers to let him administer emergency medical care, he added.

The agents rejected his offers, telling the doctor to “back up,” Heitkamp said, at least two or three minutes before emergency medical services arrived on the scene.

Emily Heller was making breakfast in her Minneapolis home when she first noticed ICE agents quarrelling with protesters on her street.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were yelling at a woman driving an SUV, Heller told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday.

An ICE agent then tried to open her car door as another stood nearby. “She reversed a little bit,” Heller said, and then turned her wheels to begin pulling away.

“An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, ‘Stop!’ and then — I mean, she was already moving — and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,” Heller said.

Heller, 39, said a neighbor who is a physician told agents he would like to administer CPR, but the agents didn’t allow him help, saying an emergency responder was en route.

“It was at least 15 minutes before the ambulance arrived,” Heller said.

Because the street was clogged with ICE vehicles, emergency crews were forced to abandon their ambulance and approach the victim on foot with no stretcher, Heller said.

“They were with her for a few minutes and then they carried her limp body away — by her limbs, not even on a stretcher,” Heller said.

“My life is forever changed from having witnessed this,” said Heller, who told CNN the narrative that the ICE agent acted in self defense is false.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent’s actions, saying the woman had attempted to run the agent over in an act of “domestic terrorism.”

This morning, Ugene Bentley watched from his front window as a confrontation between ICE agents and a woman turned deadly, killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Bentley said he saw an SUV blocking both lanes of traffic, and heard the driver blowing a whistle and yelling out an open window of her vehicle to let people know that ICE agents were nearby.

Bentley said an agent took a video of the front and rear of the car.

“I’m thinking at that time that they can follow up,” he said, noting that he assumed they recorded her license plate.

He said a truck then pulled up and more ICE agents got out, and as one tried to open an SUV door, another walked in front of the vehicle and fired the shots after Good pulled forward.

Bentley said he felt the lethal use of force was unwarranted.

“I’m not the judge on what’s legal and what’s not legal, but that right there was not called for,” he said.

People need to be paying attention to what’s happening in Minneapolis as the moment is testing “the endurance of our republic,” Mayor Jacob Frey told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

“The notion that this is domestic terrorism on the form of the victim is positively ridiculous. The way that ICE is behaving is reckless,” he said, repeating a previous statement that both the characterization of the incident and ICE’s behavior is “bullshit.”

What is important now, Frey said, is for Minneapolis residents to stand up and peacefully protest.

“This federal government wants to have an excuse to militarize Minneapolis and bring additional occupation to our city,” he said. “We won’t let them. We are going to do the right thing, we are going to be filled with hope, we are going to get justice, and we are going to make sure that we are doing right, not just by Minneapolis, but we’re going to be an example for other cities throughout the country to follow.”

The woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent today should be alive, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said.

“Renee Nicole Good should be alive,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “She was killed by an ICE agent, and the video footage that we have seen with our own eyes was a very different story from what we’re hearing from Kristi Noem and Donald Trump.”

Good was a mother of a 6-year-old, and even had stuffed animals in her car at the time of the shooting that belonged to her child, Flanagan said.

“This is outrageous. And we all should be incredibly upset by what we witnessed today,” she said, adding that she is calling for justice and transparency in this investigation.

Today’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer has increased tensions in Minneapolis after weeks of strain from immigration enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.

“I have been worried – not that federal law enforcement activity was happening, but how that enforcement was taking place in the city,” O’Hara told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “And I have specifically said I’ve been worried we would have a tragedy in our community.”

He noted that his department, and many police departments around the country, have been trained “with a very, very strong emphasis on de-escalation” to try and prevent officers or civilians from being injured.

O’Hara said he is not aware of the injured ICE officer’s identity. He said when he asked about any other injuries at today’s shooting scene, he was told “only the woman” was hurt, although it’s not immediately clear which agency he got that information from.

Footage of Wednesday’s shooting in Minneapolis appears to show the wheels of the vehicle driven by the victim were turned away from officers, according to CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, despite early claims by federal officials that the victim had weaponized her SUV against ICE agents.

Many major cities’ police departments follow the doctrine that shooting at a moving vehicle is not tactically sound. A 2023 study by the Police Executive Research Forum, an influential law enforcement think tank, recommended agencies’ policies “should prohibit shooting at or from a moving vehicle,” unless the driver of the vehicle is using it as a “weapon of mass destruction” in a situation like a ramming attack or car bombing.

Still, whether federal officials will deem the shooting justified is a “challenging question,” Miller said, because it will likely turn on the officer’s mindset.

“You’re seeing the car move forward, you see your partner who may be dragged by the car, you’re seeing that the car may hit you,” he said. “And in that tunnel vision, sometimes you make decisions absent the big picture.”

“It still begs the tactical question – and this is not a new question – which is, if you’re facing a moving vehicle and it’s a threat to you because you’re in the way, get out of the way,” Miller said.

“That’s not a suggestion on my part,” he added. “That has been the policy adopted by the New York City Police Department when I was there, by the Los Angeles Police Department when I was there, by the FBI and federal agencies.”

The ICE agent who fatally shot a woman on Wednesday morning in Minneapolis “feared for his life and the other officers around him,” said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The incident unfolded at 10:25 a.m. CT as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were conducting operations in the city, Noem said. One of their vehicles became “stuck and ensnared in the snow,” she said. As officers were attempting to push the vehicle out of the snow, Noem said a “mob of agitators that were harassing them all day” blocked them in and attempted to impede their efforts.

One of those vehicles, Noem said, was being driven by the victim, who the secretary accused of “stalking and impeding” officers’ work throughout the day. ICE agents ordered the woman to get out of the car, but she refused, Noem said, and then proceeded to “weaponize her vehicle” in an attempt to run over the officer.

That federal agent “used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues,” Noem said, before he was treated and released from a local hospital.

State and local officials have disputed claims that the shooting was done in self-defense.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem disputed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s claim that he does not know when there will be ICE operations in the state.

“That’s simply not true,” she said at a news conference today, responding to a question about Walz saying that he is not given prior notice to actions.

Noem said she would provide the governor with that information, adding that “we would love to coordinate with him.”

The secretary also accused Walz and local police of not cooperating with federal immigration efforts, adding that his administration does not give DHS “access to any information on criminals.”

She also claimed Walz has “individuals and criminals in his jurisdiction that he won’t turn over.”

Noem said she discussed the fatal shooting with Walz, but stressed they have “two very different viewpoints.”

Noem said she told Walz immigration laws need to be enforced, and she encouraged the governor “to work with us,” adding the federal agencies conducting immigration efforts in the state “have never had a cooperative arrangement” with the state or Minneapolis police officers under the discretion of Mayor Jacob Frey.

“If you talk to any of these federal law enforcement officers, they’ll say that when they call for backup in a situation that it’s hit and miss,” said Noem. She continued to say the officers were “grateful” for the city’s police chief and local officers helping to secure the scene today after the fatal shooting to ensure “nobody was harmed and that the FBI could do their work.”

Throngs of Minnesota residents and activists are holding a vigil around a makeshift shrine of flowers and candles on a patch of snow near where 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer hours earlier.

“Say it once. Say it twice. We will not put up with ICE,” they chanted. Some carried signs with messages such as “Killer ICE off our streets.”

Speakers said the actions of the federal officers are unacceptable and a direct result of a what they called militarized state with no accountability. They called for charges against the ICE officer who fatally shot the woman in her vehicle, noting that she had been there to observe the actions of federal officers.

“We are not afraid of Donald Trump and we are not afraid to say f— ICE,” one speaker said.

At one point, they chanted the name of victim.

Yards from the scene of today’s shooting – and just blocks from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020 – residents filled the streets during a peaceful yet loud candlelight vigil, paying their respects and leaving flowers on a still-bloodied patch of snow where Good died.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/10408395221424057092368003293201021-00000005.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-07 21:57:38.980289

“For months, I – along with many of my fellow elected officials, law enforcement agencies and community members – have warned of the dangers of the Trump Administration’s chaotic, reckless and unnecessary ICE operations in our cities.

Today, our worst fears became reality when an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in South Minneapolis. This is beyond unacceptable. It’s unconscionable and sickening.

President Trump and his Administration will try to justify their meddling in Minnesota – they will continue to lie and say it’s about keeping folks safe – but Minnesotans know this isn’t true. It’s a flat-out lie. Today, the President’s political stunt got a woman killed.

Trump’s actions have never been about keeping people safe. They have never been about catching criminals. They have always been about weaponizing our immigration system and using immigrant communities as political pawns.

President Trump, Secretary Noem, hear me loud and clear: ICE must leave Minnesota – NOW.

We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants are essential members of our communities. Immigrants make up the fabric of our state – and they make us stronger.

To my fellow Minnesotans, stay peaceful. Take care of one another and know that I am fighting this reckless Administration at every turn. We won’t back down.”

The shooting happened, according to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, when “violent rioters” tried to get involved in a Minneapolis ICE operation.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over a fraud scandal in the state.
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, also went after the Trump administration for its characterization of the incident.
We all saw the video, and the Trump administration is lying about it,” Martin said on X.","Democrats are slamming Trump administration officials after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

“My office is monitoring reports of an ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis today. Reports are still coming in, but [it] has been reported that a woman was killed. My heart goes out to her and her family. And anyone hurt or killed in this act of violence,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) wrote Wednesday in a post on the social platform X.

The shooting happened, according to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, when “violent rioters” tried to get involved in a Minneapolis ICE operation.

“While there’s a lot we don’t know at this time, let me be clear about one thing: Donald Trump’s decision to send thousands of armed ICE agents to Minnesota is causing serious harm and spreading terror throughout our communities. His reckless decision to escalate the aggression and number of immigration agents is a causal factor,” Ellison said.

President Trump, in a post to Truth Social on Wednesday afternoon, said he had “just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota.”

“It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he added.

Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), in a post on X, put the blame on federal authorities for the woman’s death.

“ICE just killed a U.S. citizen—allegedly blocking her from medical care and letting her die,” the Arizona Democrat said. “This is horrifying. ICE is a rogue agency incapable of reform. Minneapolis Mayor Frey is calling for ICE to vacate the city and I echo that call.”

Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey used explicit language while arguing that the Trump administration’s framing of the events of the shooting were wrong. The mayor also said he had viewed a video of the incident.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over a fraud scandal in the state. Federal authorities this week launched an expansive immigration operation there in the wake of right-wing ire zeroing in on the Midwestern state.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, also went after the Trump administration for its characterization of the incident.

“A woman in Minnesota was shot and killed by ICE today. We all saw the video, and the Trump administration is lying about it,” Martin said on X.

“The federal government under Donald Trump’s command is not protecting the peace. Trump has provoked chaos and violence in our towns and cities as part of his sick political theater. ICE has to leave Minnesota now,” he added.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in an X post that “this is not the first time Trump’s ICE has shot at civilians.”

“We need ICE out of our cities and communities,” the Evergreen State Democrat added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26007639250904-e1767817956215.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-07 22:57:00.442012

Roughly 80,000 people of Somali ancestry reside there, but the vast majority of them are American citizens or legal permanent residents.
The original immigration enforcement operation, which began in early December, focused on Somalis with final deportation orders.
That group had become a particular focus for Mr. Trump, who has railed against a federal fraud scheme that has implicated a pocket of Somali Americans in Minnesota.
More than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases, which center on what prosecutors say was a misuse of funds allocated for the state’s social safety net programs.","One day before a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis, federal immigration officers described their presence in Minnesota as the “largest operation to date.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement effort there is part of a broader immigration crackdown that has swept cities across the country since President Trump began his second term with a pledge to deport millions of people.

The actions in Minnesota have targeted undocumented immigrants, as in other cities, but focused on Somalis in particular. The state is home to the largest diaspora of Somalis in the world. Roughly 80,000 people of Somali ancestry reside there, but the vast majority of them are American citizens or legal permanent residents.

Federal authorities said this week they would increase their presence in the Minneapolis region, with about 2,000 federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security expected to participate.

“If you’re a criminal illegal alien and/or you are engaged in fraud, expect a visit from ICE,” the agency said Tuesday in a post on X.

The original immigration enforcement operation, which began in early December, focused on Somalis with final deportation orders. That group had become a particular focus for Mr. Trump, who has railed against a federal fraud scheme that has implicated a pocket of Somali Americans in Minnesota.

More than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases, which center on what prosecutors say was a misuse of funds allocated for the state’s social safety net programs. Dozens have been convicted. Most of the people prosecuted are of Somali origin. They have been accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars by billing the government for services, like child care and health care, that went undelivered.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07minn-shooting-feds-justification1-phmq/07minn-shooting-feds-justification1-phmq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 19:58:02.824763

In response to the claims DOL and WSP are violating the Keep Washington Working Act, they denied they were.","SEATTLE — Luis remembers the morning clearly.

It was just after 6:30 a.m. when his father left their home in Renton and was near The Landing, heading to work. Minutes later, immigration agents surrounded the car.

“He pulls over, rolls the window down, and they put their arms in there, reach out, open the door and take his keys and take him in and put him in one of the SUV vans,” Luis said.

Since that day, he and his sister, Izzy, have kept asking the same question:

How did immigration agents know who their father was, and where he’d be?

“It doesn't seem like a regular pull over,” Luis said. “Because they did say his name… seems more of a — they were watching routine.”

A new report from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights says it now has the answer.

A new pathway into Washington driver data

The report traces how immigration agents located Nelson Eduardo Picazo Sanchez, and links his case to a broader pattern.

Last July, KING 5 Investigators revealed that the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) had been sharing driver information with immigration enforcement, in violation of state law. The Keep Washington Working Act prohibits state agencies from assisting federal immigration enforcement efforts. After public backlash, state leaders said they shut down that access to ICE.

But researchers say federal immigration authorities continued getting Washington driver data through a different channel.

“Personally, I think that's very disappointing,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights and primary author of the report. “This isn’t the first time, not the second time, not even the third time that they’ve been caught not doing what they said.”

According to the report, agents used a Washington State Patrol system called ACCESS — a messaging “switchboard” that connects to a national law-enforcement network known as Nlets.

Through ACCESS and Nlets, officers can enter a license plate number and receive driver and vehicle information from DOL within seconds.

License plates, profiling concerns, and fast arrests

Godoy said the center reviewed multiple cases where agents appeared to stake out locations, run plates, and then make arrests shortly afterward.

“A significant percentage of the arrests we corroborated happened near places like Home Depot, Lowe’s, or Latino markets,” Godoy said. “It enables racial profiling when you go where you think a certain ethnicity congregates and then run the plates of everyone you see.”

In Sanchez’s case, Godoy said Washington State Patrol records show Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requested information tied to his license plate through ACCESS. DOL then sent back data associated with the vehicle and driver.

Sanchez was arrested on Nov. 4.

UW researchers identified at least seven other cases where immigration arrests happened after agents used ACCESS, sometimes within minutes of the search.

“In many of these cases, they run the name in Nlets or their own databases, see an immigration record and then they pull the person over,” Godoy said.

State law says agencies should not help enforce civil immigration cases

Washington’s Keep Washington Working Act bars state agencies from using their resources to help enforce civil immigration law.

The report argues that, in practice, that’s still happening when immigration agents use ACCESS to obtain driver data tied to Washington residents.

After the report's draft release, Godoy said her team reached out to the Washington State Patrol. When the state patrol found out the data was getting accessed through their system, they said they cut it off to ICE mid-November.

But experts at the UW say there are ways around that—there's other federal agencies like border patrol that could still be using this to track people down.

“If they're working shoulder to shoulder with CBP, and one agency loses access while the one next to them still has it, it doesn't do anything to stop the operation,” she said.

For one family, the findings feel personal

For Luis and Izzy, the policy debate isn’t abstract.

Their father was simply on his way to work. Somewhere, they believe, someone ran his license plate and agents already knew his name before he rolled down the window.

“It wasn’t me finding that out — it was little me,” Izzy said, fighting back tears as she recalled the day of her father's arrest. “I’ve always been a daddy’s girl. It felt like me as a little girl, getting my dad ripped away from me.”

DOL and WSP respond

State officials say the University of Washington’s findings leave out key context. In a joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the Department of Licensing and Washington State Patrol argued Washington has already taken aggressive steps to block immigration agencies from driver data, and disputed suggestions the state is violating the Keep Washington Working Act. T

hey say ICE’s access was shut off in November and that the systems involved are also used for legitimate criminal investigations.

“Since shutting off ICE access … thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied,"" the joint statement added in part.

In response to the claims DOL and WSP are violating the Keep Washington Working Act, they denied they were.

“The Keep Washington Working Act does not prohibit information-sharing for criminal law-enforcement purposes,” the statement reads.

As for not shutting off CBP's access to ACCESS/Nlets, state officials said, ""Washington state is taking a close look at all our options to protect our residents. This is an ongoing effort. We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety.""

In the last four months alone, immigration officers have fired on at least nine people in five states and Washington, D.C. All of the individuals targeted in those shootings were, like the woman killed on Wednesday, fired on while in their vehicles. In each case, officials have claimed that the agents fired in self-defense, fearing they would be struck by the vehicle.

At least one other person died as a result of those shootings.

In September, immigration officers pulled over a man driving a Subaru on a busy street outside of Chicago. The man, a Mexican immigrant named Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was shot and killed less than a minute later. Homeland security officials said that Mr. Villegas-Gonzalez had hit and dragged one of the officers with his car and that the officer who shot him was acting in self-defense. But a Times analysis of video calls into question key aspects of the government’s account.

The following month, a Mexican man living in Los Angeles was shot during a traffic stop where the man was targeted for immigration enforcement. Federal officials said the man, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, had tried to ram officers as he fled the scene, and homeland security officers fired shots, hitting the man in the elbow. A federal marshal was struck in the hand by a ricocheted bullet.

Days later, an American citizen was shot in the shoulder by an immigration agent near a bus stop in a suburb east of Los Angeles. Lawyers for the man, Carlos Jimenez, said he had asked federal agents to move away from the area, where schoolchildren would soon be gathering. Mr. Jimenez’s lawyers said he was later shot as he was driving away. But federal prosecutors accused him of pulling forward and accelerating toward an officer.

Since last January, federal immigration agents have deployed across the country as part of President Trump’s deportation blitz, often in fast-moving enforcement operations targeting individual cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Portland. Those sweeps have spurred protests that at times turned hostile, with protesters throwing objects at law enforcement and officers responding by firing non-lethal munitions.

In the 12 months through September 2024, ICE’s internal firearms and use of force committee investigated three incidents in which an officer used a firearm, according to ICE’s annual report, and in the year before that, there were five incidents in which an ICE officer used a firearm. It was not known on Wednesday what those investigations concluded.

ICE and the Homeland Security Department’s policy on the use of force says that officers are authorized to use deadly force only if the officer “has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.” The policy further states that officers should “avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/07/multimedia/07minn-shooting-ice-elsewhere-top-khlq/07minn-shooting-ice-elsewhere-top-khlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 21:57:53.889166

The woman was shot during a traffic stop in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her killing quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference in Minneapolis Wednesday evening that any death is a ""tragedy,"" but that the ICE shooting was justified.

""Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he's been taught to do in that situation,"" Noem said.

Noem alleged that the woman who was killed was trying to block officers with her vehicle, had been harassing them through the day and ""attempted to run a law enforcement officer over"" before she was shot.

""We'll let the FBI continue the investigation to get it resolved,"" she said, adding that the officer was hit by the vehicle, taken to a hospital and released.

Noem added that immigration enforcement has made over 1,500 arrests in Minnesota in recent weeks.

Earlier Wednesday while visiting Texas, Noem described the incident as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" carried out against ICE officers.

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization as ""garbage"" and criticized the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said.

Minneapolis Police chief gives no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone

Chief Brian O'Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters. Unlike federal officials, O'Hara didn't say the driver was trying to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

""This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. ... At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off,"" the chief said.

""At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.""

Minnesota official says state will investigate the shooting with federal authorities

That's according to Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

""Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy. So any speculation about what has happened would be just that,"" Jacobson told reporters.

The shooting happened in the district of Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who called it ""state violence,"" not law enforcement.

City says 37-year-old shooting victim died at hospital

In a statement, the city of Minneapolis says police officers ""responded to the reports of shots fired and found a woman with life-threatening gunshot wounds to the head.

""Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond.

During a news conference today, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights safely and peacefully.
McLaughlin said in a statement that ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when the 37-year-old woman was shot.","Minneapolis Mayor Frey tonight doubled down on his rejection of federal officials' characterization of today's fatal shooting as an act of self-defense.

“Of course I stand by what I said,” he told Tom Llamas on ""Top Story."" ""Look, I’ve got two eyes. All of you do, too. You can see for yourself what happened was reckless, and, by the way, entirely predictably because we have been saying, the chief and I vocally for over a month, that somebody was going to get hurt or killed.""

“By the way, this is not like the first instance of horrific treatment. They were dragging a pregnant woman through the snow; we’ve seen them indiscriminately pulling Latino and Somali people off the street. That is not the way we behave in America,” he said about immigration officials' actions.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated that the ICE agent opened fire in self-defense.

Frey said the victim was “clearly trying to leave the situation and get out of there.” He said his office has not yet spoken with the family of the victim.

He called for the shooting to be thoroughly investigated. The state has said the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will investigate.

“Get ICE out of this city,” Frey reiterated. “Right now crime is dropping in virtually every category, in virtually every neighborhood. That is important work. But what is clear is that the actions that ICE is taking is not about keeping people safe. It’s about terrorizing communities, it’s about ripping families apart, it’s about eating away at the very fabric that makes Minneapolis, Minneapolis, and America, America.""

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, today criticized DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s use of the term “domestic terrorism” to describe a woman who was shot by an ICE agent while in her vehicle today.

Smith called Noem’s description “reckless” and said it came while the incident is still under investigation, including by the FBI.

“Domestic terrorism was the Oklahoma City bombing,” Smith said. “This was a woman in her car in a neighborhood that is only a few miles from where I live. I know it quite well.”

The shooting was captured on video by a bystander.

“When you have an event like this, you have a killing like this, there is an investigation — you bring in people who know how to do investigations to understand exactly what happened,” Smith said.

“And yet the president of the United States and the secretary have been just pronouncing what they think happened,” Smith said. “I can see with my own eyes what millions of people have now seen in this video.”

She said it is hard to see in this video, any evidence that this woman rammed ICE agents.

At a news conference tonight, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem provided an account of the moments before shots rang out in Minneapolis.

She said ICE was carrying out operations in Minnesota at 10:25 a.m. CT today and attempting to push out of the snow one of its vehicles that had become stuck. At that time, “a mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began blocking them in, shouting at them, and impeding law enforcement operations,” Noem said.

ICE officers approached the driver of a vehicle that was “blocking the officers in,” she said. According to Noem, the woman “had been stalking and impeding their work all throughout the day.”

ICE agents ordered her to exit the vehicle, but she did not comply, Noem said.

“She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle, and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem said. “The ICE officer, fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues.""

Witnesses at the scene have told NBC News that the woman did not appear to try to run over the ICE agent. Rather, they said, it seemed she was trying to drive away from them.

Noem said the ICE agent involved in today's shooting was ""hit by the vehicle"" the victim was driving.

""She hit him. He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,"" Noem said.

She said the officer, whom officials have not yet identified, had been attacked before while on the job.

""In fact, the very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time as well,"" she said.

A crowd has gathered in Minneapolis for a vigil following today’s fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent in an incident that has sparked outrage and condemnation among local officials and residents.

In a notice about the event, organizers said, “We witnessed an atrocious attack on our community today.”

Some held signs, including one that read “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Dieu Do, an immigrant rights activist, told NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis that “it could have been any of us.”

She disputed the characterization by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that the person who was shot was engaging in an “act of domestic terrorism” and driving toward ICE.

“Domestic terrorism is what ICE is doing — using unmarked vehicles, unmarked clothing, coming in and taking our community members without any paperwork,” Do said.

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., today said she wants ICE out of the state.

“I think ICE should leave,” Smith said. “The longer that they are in Minnesota, the less safe people are. And I think we could see today the implication of that, this senseless killing of this woman who was in her car.”

Smith also got emotional when asked why she thought the Trump administration is fixated on Minnesota.

“I wish I knew,” Smith said. “I mean, I wish they would just leave us the f--- alone. I mean, seriously.”

“When did things stop being about politics and and start being about actual human decency?” she said.

“We can all hypothesize on what all of their political reasons are,” Smith said. “But meanwhile, a woman died being shot in her car — and everything that they are doing is making it worse and not better.”

Emily Heller, 39, wasn't even dressed when she heard whistles alerting the neighborhood that ICE agents were in the area this morning.

“I’ve never seen someone die in front of my house before. This was horrendous,” Heller told NBC News.

Heller said she's never been involved in activities to warn or protest the federal immigration agency, but when she walked out to her porch she said she saw six or seven ICE vehicles and a protester who had parked perpendicular to traffic.

Heller said she saw agents exit their cars and tell the driver to leave, to ""get out of here.""

“And then they went up to her car and started trying to open her door, and that’s when I’m sure she got spooked and tried to flee,"" Heller said. ""So she reversed a little bit and then angled her wheels so she could drive away. And as she was trying to move forward, one of the ICE agents stepped in front of her vehicle and reached across the hood and fired his weapon about three or four times and shot her in the face.""

The driver crashed into a post and hit some cars and “just slumped over in her vehicle,"" Heller said. She shared graphic video that shows the woman covered in blood in the driver's seat. A man with raised arms who identified himself as a physician asked ICE agents if he could check the woman's pulse but was denied, according to both Heller's account and the video.

Heller said the agents wouldn't let anyone near the scene and told people that emergency services were on the way. In the video, one agent can be heard saying, ""We have our own medics.""

It took about 15 minutes for EMS to arrive, Heller estimated, because vehicles were blocking the street.

“They were on foot when they got through, and they carried her body out, just like by her limbs, they didn’t even have a stretcher,"" Heller said. ""She was carried out like a sack of potatoes.""

“I’ve never seen anything like this before. This was horrific and will change my life forever,” she said. “It’s just so terrifying. I feel so scared.""

She said she felt as if the ICE agents were untrained, inexperienced and didn’t know what they were doing. Heller said the driver was being told to leave but also being instructed to stop at the same time, then the man ""just fired"" his gun.

""They’re just out of their league, and they didn’t know how to handle the situation,"" Heller said. ""They couldn’t let somebody give life support. It was just total chaos.”

She said at times she was frightened watching the agents, some of whom were touching their guns. Heller thought in that moment, ""oh ... I could die,"" she said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz repeatedly implored residents to remain calm and not “take the bait” from the Trump administration in the wake of the fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis.

His words during a news conference echoed those of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who last year warned his owned residents not to allow protests to turn violent. At the time, Pritzker argued Trump officials were looking for a pretext to militarize their cities.

Walz gave the same warning, noting that there could be far-reaching consequences.

""To Minnesotans, don’t take the bait. Do not take the bait. Do not allow them to deploy federal troops into here. Do not allow them to invoke the insurrection act. Do not allow them to declare martial law,"" Walz said. ""Do not allow them to lie about the security and the decency of this state. And let’s let this investigation play out.”

President Donald Trump defended the actions of the ICE officer involved in the fatal shooting.

The president said in a post on Truth Social that he viewed a clip of the incident, calling it ""a horrible thing to watch.""

""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,"" he wrote. ""Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now but is now recovering in the hospital.""

Trump said that law enforcement officers and ICE agents are regularly threatened.

""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, expressed concern that the statements made by Homeland Security officials do ""not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts.""

The fourth-term Minnesota senator expressed condolences for the family of the woman who was killed today before criticizing the role of ICE agents in the state. She called for full transparency and an investigation into the shooting.

""While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe,"" Klobuchar said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., called the actions of the federal agents ""unconscionable and reprehensible"" in her own statement this afternoon. She described the woman who was killed as a ""legal observer"" and characterized the events as ""state violence.""

“This administration has shown, yet again, that it does not care about the safety of Minnesotans,"" Omar said. ""Instead of protecting our communities, they are unleashing violence — terrorizing neighborhoods and now killing a civilian.""

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he was just waking up when he heard the honking and other activity outside his home, which faces the street where the shooting took place, and went to the window.

He said he saw a Honda askew between the curbside and the bike lane, its front end poking into the bike lane. He said there were two men in full fatigues, wearing garments that said ""police,"" but no other identification.

""One was right by the passenger door and one by the driver’s side. There was clearly commotion. I couldn’t hear what anybody was saying,"" Perzana said. ""Then a third person approached the vehicle from the driver's side and started pulling quite hard on the door handle two or three times, at which the vehicle reversed a few feet and then started going forward.""

Perzana said that he heard Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's allegation that the woman was trying to run down an officer. He said it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

""When she started driving forward, there were, I think, three shots from the person who was originally by the driver’s side door, not the person who had been pulling on the handle,"" he said.

He added that ""there was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through.""

Perzana said an ambulance arrived around 10 minutes later, but could not reach the vehicle because of ICE vehicles in the street.

""There were probably six or seven, sort of parked all askew...blocking traffic,"" he said. ""They didn’t not, you know, clear the way for the ambulance so, some people approached on foot.""

Aidan’s wife, Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood for more than two years and ""love it."" She did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on her street, but said she does have many ""Latinx"" neighbors.

""We are really happy here,"" she said. ""We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue. There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards. ""

Today's shooting is not Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's first experience leading the city through an officer-involved shooting under public scrutiny.

Frey came to the national spotlight in 2020 when George Floyd was murdered by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd's death was initially described as a medical emergency, but bystander video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck while the man gasped, saying he could not breathe.

The case sparked renewed anger over police brutality and a racial reckoning that swept the U.S., sparking protests in the Twin Cities that eventually ignited across the country. Protests in Minneapolis at the time were fraught with physical violence between residents and police.

During a news conference today, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara urged citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights safely and peacefully.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrests by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there today.

This week, DHS sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the ICE shooting in Minneapolis, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

Brandon Hewitt, who is new to the neighborhood, said he was getting up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard three gunshots. He then looked outside and said he saw that a vehicle had crashed.

“I’m pretty right-leaning, but seeing this, this is not what you need to do,” he told KARE. “It’s not how to do it. It’s not how we’re supposed to do things around here in America.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city.

“What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,” he said at a news conference after the shooting. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”

Frey said that there was little he could say to improve the situation, but he had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

“To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,” the mayor said. “We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety, and you are doing the opposite.”

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis today after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Video footage from NBC affiliate KARE 11 of Minneapolis showed a burgundy SUV with what appeared to be a bullet hole in the windshield. The vehicle had crashed into a light pole. It’s not clear to whom the SUV belongs or from where the bullet was shot.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the woman who was killed of weaponizing her vehicle, ""attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them."" McLaughlin said in a statement that ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when the 37-year-old woman was shot.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-3x2-minnesota-shooting-scene-vl-211p-6a7722.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 19:58:12.196444

Former San Francisco Judge Dana Leigh Marks said the move to shutter the largest of three immigration courts serving Northern California feels like a step toward dismantling the path to asylum entirely.
The San Francisco court, which is the largest of three that hear cases from the Central Valley to the Oregon border, has a backlog of 120,000 cases.
“For a long time, it has been seen as a thorn in the side of more restrictive immigration policies,” Marks said.
“The only rationale I can find to justify closing the San Francisco court instead of relocating it in the close area … is that it’s an effective way to close down a more liberal court.” KQED’s Tyche Hendricks contributed to this report.","San Francisco’s main immigration court is set to close by the end of the year, driving former judges and advocates to worry that it’s part of an effort by the Trump administration to drastically remake and shrink the overburdened immigration system in the Bay Area and beyond.

Former judges told KQED that staffers were informed Tuesday that the court would not renew its lease at 100 Montgomery St., where the majority of the Bay Area’s asylum cases are heard.

The court, which began 2025 with 21 judges, now has just four remaining after 13 were fired and four more retired at the end of the year, which some attorneys told KQED they were pressured into. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired since last January.

Former San Francisco Judge Dana Leigh Marks said the move to shutter the largest of three immigration courts serving Northern California feels like a step toward dismantling the path to asylum entirely.

“The system is bleeding from 1,000 small cuts,” she said. “It seems to me like what the current administration is trying to do is maximize the dysfunction in order to allow a change in the law by Congress. To eventually eliminate the system and eliminate the due process that immigrants get.”

Marks said she’s heard from current immigration attorneys that when the judge presiding over their client’s cases has been fired, their court dates have been removed from the docket and pushed back by up to three or four years.

Former Judge Arwen Swink, who was fired from San Francisco’s bench last month, told KQED that current staffers got an email confirming that the Montgomery Street court would shutter by January 2027, when the court’s current lease ends. She and three other former judges, who spoke with KQED on the condition of anonymity to protect their sources from retaliation, said the court is aiming to end operations at the site as soon as the summer and plans to consolidate remaining staff in the Bay Area’s other immigration courthouse in Concord.

The Rev. Leah Martens, who has been attending vigils outside the nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in recent months as part of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, said the news on Tuesday felt like “a gut punch.”

“It feels like this administration is continuing to make moves that make it harder for people to find legal pathways to be secure,” she told KQED. “It feels like that’s not the goal anymore.”

Martens said the immigration system is already backlogged, and she worries that shutting down the city’s main court will only further slow immigrants’ cases.

The San Francisco court, which is the largest of three that hear cases from the Central Valley to the Oregon border, has a backlog of 120,000 cases.

Another in Concord, which opened in 2024 and was expected to grow to a similar size, has just seven judges. Sacramento’s smaller court shrunk from six to three judges last year. The two locations are responsible for around 90,000 more cases.

On Wednesday morning, the line of people waiting for check-in appointments outside the ICE field office on Sansome Street, about half a mile from the court, extended down the block and around the corner. Martens said some of the people standing outside the federal building, holding folders of legal paperwork and bundled against the early morning cold, had also been lined up Monday or Tuesday but hadn’t made it through the long, slow-moving queue.

The Rev. Deborah Lee, who heads the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, said she sees the closure of San Francisco’s court as part of a series of moves by the Trump administration to dismantle the immigration judicial system.

Last spring, ICE officers began arresting immigrants outside courtrooms where they had mandatory hearings, a tactic that was previously unprecedented. DOJ attorneys would move to have asylum-seekers’ cases dismissed, while officers waited in courtroom hallways to take them into detention if they were. The DOJ used similar tactics to detain immigrants who reported to ICE check-in appointments like those held at 630 Sansome St.

If asylum-seekers fail to appear for a mandatory hearing or appointment, their case can be dropped altogether.

Marks said prosecutors have also increasingly moved to deny cases before immigrants have a hearing and offer asylum cooperation agreements, under which people can go to a country other than their home country if they agree to leave the U.S., without taking the necessary legal steps.

“What this current administration has been doing is almost like a smash-and-grab robbery. They’re not following any of the established rules … providing flimsy and transparent justifications, or just disregarding the rules,” Marks said. “Some might not hold up with litigation, but they aren’t waiting.”

Milli Atkinson, who directs the Immigrant Legal Defense Program at the Bar Association of San Francisco, said it is possible that the DOJ could shift some hearings in the city to three courtrooms in the Sansome Street building, which is federally owned and not expected to close. But no judges are located at the site, and the communication sent to Montgomery Street staff suggests that operations will be consolidated to Concord.

“Logistically, it’s just going to be a nightmare,” she said. “It is going to be chaotic for several months, where people are not going to know if they have a hearing scheduled, where the hearing is scheduled, who their judge is, if their case is going to be moved.”

Amanda Maya, the asylum program director at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, said the move also backpedals on the goal of opening Concord’s court: easing access for immigrants in the East Bay and Central Valley.

“It was an incredible development for people who were already in the East Bay and were having to travel to San Francisco, where it didn’t make sense, or people in the Central Valley who unfortunately don’t have an immigration courthouse,” Maya said. “But now we’ve created the problem that existed, but for people on the Peninsula or people who live in the South Bay.”

Maya also said that many of the Bay Area’s legal resource centers and nonprofits are based in San Francisco because of its proximity to the court. Programs like the Bar Association of San Francisco’s Federal Pro Bono Project, through which immigrants can get legal advice from attorneys, have spent years building relationships with the city’s judges and court staff.

Marks said it’s not unheard of for the immigration court to move to a new location when its lease expires, but she said eliminating what has been perceived as one of the most liberal courts nationwide feels calculated.

“For a long time, it has been seen as a thorn in the side of more restrictive immigration policies,” Marks said. “The only rationale I can find to justify closing the San Francisco court instead of relocating it in the close area … is that it’s an effective way to close down a more liberal court.”

The City’s law enforcement partners at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department West Hollywood Station have confirmed that Deputies responded midday to that block following resident reports of men in two large SUVs having detained an individual from a small pickup truck, which was then left unattended. Deputies remained with the vehicle until a family member responded and took possession of the vehicle.

According to the West Hollywood Station, there is no confirmation from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that it conducted the detention.

Mr. Mamdani’s pick to lead the city’s Commission on Human Rights, Christine Clarke, is another step toward filling out his new administration. The commission investigates complaints of unlawful incidents of discrimination and educates the public about the nuances of New York’s human rights law.

The appointment of Ms. Clarke, the chief of litigation and advocacy at Legal Services NYC, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to low-income New Yorkers, also gave Mr. Mamdani the opportunity to lean into the issue of income inequality that was central to his campaign for mayor.

“For nearly 82 years, no matter its name, the City Commission on Human Rights has done the vital work of protecting human rights in our city, of delivering justice,” Mr. Mamdani said, speaking from an area in Jackson Heights, Queens, that is known as Diversity Plaza because of the vast range of countries represented by its stores and vendors. “That work has never been more important, and the person entrusted to lead it has never been more important either.”

At Legal Services NYC, Ms. Clarke worked on a federal discrimination lawsuit against the city filed by several survivors of domestic violence who claimed the police had violated their civil rights by denying them interpreters.

The ensuing settlement called for new practices for the Police Department, and mandated training for officers responding to domestic violence cases involving people who are not proficient in English.

Mr. Mamdani and Ms. Clarke vowed on Wednesday to beef up what is commonly regarded by critics as a lackluster commission, low on funds and slow to respond to discrimination cases. Last month, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, issued an audit that found the commission had “allowed some housing discrimination cases to sit at times for years without resolution.”

In response to a reporter’s question, Ms. Clarke acknowledged “enormous delays in the Commission on Human Rights” and vowed to speed up its output.

Frey blamed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for escalating the situation in the city.

DHS says driver was trying to ram agents

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that an ICE agent fatally shot a person in a vehicle, claiming that the person was trying to ram agents.

""Our officer followed his training and did exactly what he was trained to do,"" United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.

The agency's full statement can be read below:

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Operations are set to continue in the city and state despite the ongoing investigation, Noem said.

""We're still out on the streets doing our work,"" she said. ""We are going to continue to operate in Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota.""

Noem said the agent who shot and killed Good was taken to the hospital, treated by a doctor and released to spend time with his family. She did not provide any details about possible injuries or how long he may be out.

She added that the same agent was previously in a similar situation where he was ""hit and drug"" by a car. She didn't provide other details.

Videos circulating online show moments before and after the shooting

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot a driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out using an expletive. One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV. The driver appears to slowly back, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said at the Wednesday press conference that he had viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

""The narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative,"" Frey said. ""It is not true.""

City officials said there was no indication the woman who was shot was the target of any law enforcement activity.

Leaders, Minnesota residents respond to ICE shooting

At a separate press conference later Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said the state was prepared for protests he expects to take place in the coming days, and urged Minnesotans to ""not take the bait"" from the Trump administration to engage in violence.

""If you protest, and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully as you always do,"" Walz said. ""We can't give them what they want. The hearts and minds of the people in this state are on our side. To Americans, I ask you this: Please stand with Minneapolis. To Minnesotans, know that our administration is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.""

The governor, who announced a day earlier that he would not be seeking reelection, said he was afraid the federal government's actions would lead to escalation.

""We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety; that someone was going to get hurt,"" Walz said. ""Just yesterday, I said exactly that. What we're seeing is a consequence of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV. And today that recklessness caused someone their life.""

Reporters in the area saw more than 100 federal agents descend on the scene near 34th Street and Portland Avenue after the shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

According to KARE11 reporters at the scene, a crashed car at the intersection had a bullet hole in the front windshield on the driver's side. Two other cars have wreckage damage. Near the scene, protesters began chanting anti-ICE slogans.

A tense interaction nearby saw protesters throwing snowballs at federal officials. The immigration officials responded with pepper spray and paintballs, which are considered non-lethal crowd control devices.

The incident happened during what the Department of Homeland Security called its ""largest immigration operation ever."" An estimated six hundred agents and investigators are examining alleged fraud in the state.

State Senator Omar Fateh said in a social media post that he's received reports that a doctor at the scene was denied the ability to provide lifesaving CPR by federal law enforcement. In a press conference, Frey said he could not verify this witness account.

A witness showed KARE reporters what appeared to be video of responders attempting to resuscitate someone.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara previously said his department does not enforce immigration laws, according to KARE 11. On Tuesday, he said he appointed a designated supervisor and placed additional officers on standby around the clock due to concerns of potential unrest.

“Every day for the last several weeks has been a challenge,” O’Hara said, adding that his greatest concern is the potential for unrest or a tragedy in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. He asked protesters to remain peaceful and urged federal agents to conduct their work “professionally and lawfully.”

According to DHS, agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Minnesota, including 150 in Minneapolis on Monday.

In a statement on his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump said he had seen at least one of the videos showing the Minneapolis shooting.

""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" he wrote. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.""

The president said he blamed the incident, and others like it over the past several months, on left-leaning protesters interfering with ICE operations.

""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,"" Trump wrote.

Large crowds chanting anti-ICE slogans formed near the scene of the shooting, local news outlets showed.

Anti-ICE protests

There have been passionate protests in some cities against the immigration enforcement operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are ""millions"" of undocumented migrants.

The DHS called the violence a ""direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers.""

The shooting reportedly occurred at 34th Street and Portland Avenue in Minneapolis. Nearby, ICE officers were seen pepper-spraying and shoving protesters during immigration enforcement operations in South Minneapolis, footage broadcast by local CBS affiliate WCCO showed.

Dozens of protesters and bystanders were seen on the scene after the incident. ""There's no way whatever this person did that they deserved to be killed for it,"" one bystander told the broadcaster.

Trump has made preventing unlawful immigration and expelling undocumented migrants top priorities during his second term, and has tightened conditions for entering the United States and obtaining visas. During his campaign, Trump likened undocumented migrants to ""animals,"" frequently linking them, without evidence, to criminal behavior.

ICE – which critics accuse of transforming into a paramilitary force under Trump – has been tasked with deporting an unprecedented number of undocumented migrants during the Republican's second term.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged for the public to ""remain calm"" as his team gathered information on the shooting.

Trump's White House called Minneapolis Mayor Frey a ""scumbag"" for comments after the shooting in which he accused ICE of ""causing chaos and distrust.""

Video obtained by the Minnesota Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding the driver of a maroon SUV get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting.

But Trump wrote on social media that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”

“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” Trump wrote.

Minnesota’s Democratic congressional delegation, and other Democrats in Washington, D.C., strongly condemned the incident and questioned the subsequent comments from the administration.

“We need full transparency and an investigation of what happened, and I am deeply concerned that statements made by DHS do not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts,” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the state’s senior senator, said in a statement.

A statement from several Minneapolis City Council members identified the victim as Renee Nicole Good, 37. A photo of the SUV shows several stuffed animals hanging out of the glove compartment.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the woman tried to run over the agent.

“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” McLaughlin said. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the victim a “domestic terrorist.”

House Republican Whip Tom Emmer gave his support to the ICE officer.

“Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals,” he said in a statement. “May God bless and protect them in their efforts. Shame on the elected officials who endanger these agents by spewing lies and hateful rhetoric.”

Dems call for investigation

Democrats on Capitol Hill denounced the attack and the administration’s response.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for the ICE officer who shot the woman to be criminally investigated.

“There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing,” Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life.”

Minnesota Democrats said the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities had heightened tensions.

“For weeks, Donald Trump has directed ICE and DHS agents to racially profile and arrest Minnesotans in their homes, their workplaces, and on our streets,” Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said in a statement, adding that more than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in the state.

“Trump’s reckless and dangerous immigration policies do nothing to make us safer,” she continued. “Today in Minneapolis, these actions resulted in a masked federal agent fatally shooting a woman in the head.”

Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said the woman fatally shot by an ICE officer was a U.S. citizen. She called for ICE to leave Minnesota.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress and whose district includes the site of the shooting, said the woman was a legal observer, which is a neutral third party who attends protests or other public demonstrations to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.

“ICE’s actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible,” Omar said.

DHS practices, budget questioned

DHS received billions for immigration enforcement in last year's tax and spending cuts package passed by congressional Republicans. The funding can be used for hiring new ICE officers and detention and removal of immigrants.

On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, doubling from 10,000 agents to 22,000.

A top Senate Democratic appropriator, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, wrote on social media that “Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn’t restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency.”

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement that he was concerned the aggressive DHS practices will lead to more tragedies.

“All evidence indicates that hiring standards have been lowered, training is inadequate, and internal controls are insufficient,” he said. “These conditions have allowed agents to operate without proper oversight, and, in some cases, unlawfully.”

Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego also criticized the hiring practices of ICE, specifically calling out White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy.

“What happened is a disgrace and we need an investigation immediately,” Gallego said on social media. “It's clear that that agent didn't have the proper training, and that's because Stephen Miller is going full speed ahead to hire as many agents as possible.”

Day care investigation

The federal immigration operation in Minneapolis began last month but intensified this week after a right-wing influencer reported day care centers run by members of the Somali community as fraudulent.

In response, the Trump administration directed states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers and Noem has zeroed in on the city, which has a large Somali community, for immigration enforcement.

The shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent occurred Wednesday morning in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis as federal immigration officials conducted a sweeping operation, Gov. Tim Walz said.

The Minneapolis County Council released a statement Wednesday afternoon that said Good, 37, was the woman who was shot and killed. Good's family confirmed to KUSA that she's from the Colorado Springs area.

Earlier in the day, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said it didn't appear she was the target of any law-enforcement activity.

The Minneapolis City Council released a statement saying Good was ""out caring for her neighbors"" when she was killed.

“This morning an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a member of our community"" the statement says in part, KARE11 reports. ""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government. Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

O'Hara said the woman was in her vehicle, which was blocking the street. Video circulating on social media shows ICE agents approaching the car on foot and the woman beginning to drive away as an agent yanks on her door handle. At least two shots were fired into the vehicle, which then crashed.

A red SUV was visible at the scene with a bullet hole through the driver's side windshield. The SUV was smashed into a light pole, with two damaged cars parked nearby, KARE11 reported.

O'Hare said that the woman was taken to a hospital, and her spouse has arrived there.

""This is a very tragic situation where a woman lost her life."" O'Hara said.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement the woman was among a group of protesters and attempted to hit ICE agents with her vehicle ""in an attempt to kill them."" She said an ICE agent fired shots at the woman, who was hit and killed.

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot the driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out, using an expletive.

One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV.

The driver appears to slowly back up, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said he viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

ICE agents who were injured are expected to make a full recovery, McLaughlin said. She did not say how many agents were injured or what their injuries are.

DHS said on Tuesday that it had launched an immigration enforcement operation with 2,000 agents, tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KUSA/images/e0012286-f16d-4d76-a781-d69c2713752d/20260107T230509/e0012286-f16d-4d76-a781-d69c2713752d_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 19:58:30.596781

The full picture of what exactly happened is still coming into focus, including through eyewitness accounts and videos. But federal officials are describing the killing in starkly different terms from state and local officials.

How did the shooting occur?

Minneapolis Police Department chief Brian O'Hara said officers responded to a report Wednesday morning of shots being fired in an incident involving federal law enforcement.

The city's officers found a woman with a gunshot wound to the head who was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, the police chief said in a news conference Wednesday.

Watch the news conference in the player above.

O'Hara offered a preliminary picture of what happened: The woman was in her car and blocking a roadway. A federal officer then approached the motorist on foot while the vehicle began to drive away. At least two shots were fired and then the vehicle crashed alongside the roadway.

Neither the ICE officer nor the victim have been identified by authorities. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the woman was 37 years old. O'Hara said she appeared to be a middle-aged white woman.

The Minnesota Star Tribune reported that the victim's mother identified her as Renee Nicole Good, saying she was ""loving, forgiving and affectionate.""

There was ""nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation,"" the police chief said.

Videos taken by bystanders and posted to social media show two officers approaching a car that is stopped across the middle of a snowy and icy road. One officer attempts to open the driver's side door and reaches into the vehicle as it starts reversing. A third officer with his gun drawn crosses in front of the car as it moves away from the agents. That officer, who appears to be knocked backward but not hit, opens fire on the vehicle. The car then speeds toward the curb, crashing into parked vehicles.

What the Trump administration is saying

The Department of Homeland Security said the shooting was an act of self-defense. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told PBS News in a statement that the ICE officer fired defensively, ""fearing for his life"" and the lives of others.

Speaking from Texas, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem likened the incident to an ""act of domestic terrorism"" against ICE officers by a motorist who tried to run them over with her vehicle.

""An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot to protect himself and the people around him,"" she told reporters.

President Donald Trump weighed in on the shooting on social media, suggesting the driver was ""very disorderly"" and ""viciously ran over the ICE Officer, [sic]"" who he said was recovering in the hospital after the incident. DHS' McLaughlin said in the statement that ""the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.""

What Minnesota officials are saying

Watch the clip in the player above.

Frey strongly rebuked the federal characterization of events, saying that he had viewed footage of the incident.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" he said. ""I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t.""

A reporter asked Frey whether the woman was driving her car as a ""weapon"" toward the ICE agent. The mayor said that didn't appear to be the case.

Frey said the ICE agent was ""recklessly using power"" that resulted in a person's death.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said.

He then said he had a message to ICE: ""Get the f**k out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.""

Gov. Tim Walz addressed Minneapolis residents in a later news conference, saying, ""I feel your anger.""

The governor, who mentioned the protests following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd throughout Wednesday's news conference, then asked for any protests to remain peaceful. ""They want a show,"" he said of the Trump administration. ""We can't give it to them.""

He then addressed the Trump administration.

""We do not need any further help from the federal government. To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: You've done enough,"" the governor added.

Why is ICE in Minneapolis?

Minneapolis is the latest major U.S. city to see a surge of immigration enforcement activity. The Trump administration sent more than 2,000 federal agents to the area earlier this week. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told Newsmax that this is the ""largest immigration operation ever.""

The deployment followed mounting scrutiny from federal investigators over fraud allegations targeting Somali child care providers in the state. Trump has also singled out Somalis in his anti-immigrant rhetoric.

In his social media post, Trump claimed that the ""Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting"" law enforcement officers and ICE agents on a ""daily basis.""

Walz, who had called the deployment a ""war"" against Minnesota, responded to DHS' social media post about the shooting, saying he had viewed video of the incident.

""Don't believe this propaganda machine,"" the governor wrote. ""The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.""

This deference may be under reconsideration, given the latest ruling in the Illinois Guard case.
In both the Illinois Guard case and the “reciprocal tariff” case, the question of proportionality arises.","Card players recognize the signs of a “tell,” a player’s demeanor that telegraphs intent for the next hand. Just before Christmas, the Supreme Court in Trump v. Illinois made a procedural ruling that prevented the Trump administration from deploying Illinois National Guard troops in Chicago. Could this decision signal that the Court may rule against the administration in the Trump tariff cases?

The stay blocking deployment of troops in Chicago was upheld by a 6-3 vote. It centered on interpreting 10 U.S.C. §12406(3)—a statute the administration invoked to federalize (activate) the National Guard to enforce federal law. The Supreme Court concluded that the government had not shown that this statute authorized the president to deploy the Guard in Chicago. It cited the statutory requirement that that the president first be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws”—a condition it found was not met or shown. The Court’s majority (Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting) defined “regular forces” as the regular US military. Federal troops generally cannot be used for domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by Congress (e.g., the Insurrection Act, pointing to limits under the Posse Comitatus Act). The Court found that there was no showing that “regular forces” could not execute the laws and that the legal conditions for military use had not been fulfilled.

The president’s use of “reciprocal” tariffs on imports of almost everything from everywhere, first announced on April 2 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), would seem to be as remote a fact pattern that could be imagined from the issues in the Illinois Guard case. But there are a few striking parallels in the two sets of facts and perhaps some similarities in the reasoning. In both cases the president is claiming powers without limit, powers that intrude on the domains of other parts of the American government. Both cases involve the separation of powers—in the Guard case, it is the vertical separation between the states and the federal government. In the tariffs case, it is the potential trespass on the powers of the Congress.

Here is a breakdown of the similarities in the legal considerations before the Court.

Intrusion on powers entrusted by the Constitution to other parts of the government

Although not unknown—for example, in civil rights cases—federalizing a state’s guard over the governor’s objection is one of the most intrusive actions the federal government can take against a state. Illinois argues that accepting the government’s position for federalizing the Guard would allow the president to regularly commandeer state military forces for routine crime control even when state authorities were functioning and opposed the action. This would dramatically weaken the balance struck between federal and states’ police powers. There would be no limits. See brief of the State of Illinois.

Similarly, by declaring an emergency under IEEPA, any time that the president wishes to apply a tariff, he could do so when conducting normal commercial relations with other countries. In the tariffs case, it is the president assuming powers clearly assigned by the Constitution to the Congress. The president’s “emergency” power to deploy tariffs would have no effective limits, as only a vote in both Houses by a two-thirds supermajority could assure the end of an emergency and the removal of the tariffs the president declared. See V.O.S. Selections v. Trump and the oral argument at the Supreme Court on the cases.

Stretching statutory authority beyond its text

10 U.S.C. §12406 allows federalization of the Guard in limited circumstances. Detaching the statute from its preconditions, especially the requirement that the president be “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws,” would convert an exceptional power into a general domestic policing authority. In other words, the statute was being read as: “If the president thinks it useful, he may federalize the guard.” Congress did not write §12406 that broadly.

IEEPA, a sanctions statute, does not even include tariffs in its list of means to be used. It refers to unusual circumstances of a foreign threat that constitutes an emergency. Trade deficits are neither unusual nor clearly an emergency. Tariffs might be used to enforce a trade sanction but not converted into a general domestic revenue raising or even retaliatory authority.

Bypassing existing authority

When presidents deploy military force domestically, they rely on the Insurrection Act, which has explicit triggers (e.g., insurrection, obstruction of federal law, deprivation of constitutional rights). The Act carries political and legal accountability and has a well-understood history of precedents. It has been used in limited circumstances to maintain order in Little Rock, AR, when ending segregation in the public schools in the 1950s, for example, and in the face of widespread riots.

The reciprocal tariffs are an end-run around Congress’s chosen framework. The Congress provided authority to deal with balance of payments emergencies (limited to a 15 percent tariff and 150 days duration). There are separate authorities to deal with threats to national security (Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) and to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices (Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974). During most of the last 90 years, there has been delegated trade agreement authority to modify tariffs. That authority expired during the presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Expansion of presidential powers

What would come next if the Court approved the government’s theory in upholding deployment of the Guard? Could the Guard be federalized for fighting crime, enforcing immigration or other laws, or dealing with political unrest generally? Could a standing alternative police force be created? Could invoking emergency powers be normalized if this deployment of the Guard was normalized?

Similarly, if the Court upholds the tariffs, what constraints exist on the president’s future use of the power to tax trade if the “reciprocal” tariffs he imposed are allowed to stand?

Conclusion: Proportionality

The Roberts Court has been very favorable to the executive branch, including allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) broad scope to enforce immigration laws, in granting the president immunity from criminal acts when conducting the business of government, and in a host of other ways. This deference may be under reconsideration, given the latest ruling in the Illinois Guard case. The stay on the Guard may be a harbinger of a shift of attitude for a new majority of the court. Although the executive has been given extensive support from the Court to act as it wishes, there are still and ought to be constitutional limits. The Illinois decision may be instructive: The reasoning it applied is a strong mandate for returning the Constitution to its place in ensuring balance among co-equal branches of the legislative and the executive, with the Court sitting as the arbiter that the respective roles will be respected.

One of the most important powers the Constitution grants to Congress is the power to impose tariffs, the power to tax. The entire structure of government, the system of checks and balances among the branches, can readily be undermined if the president is allowed to exercise unrestricted power to raise revenue through imposing tariffs.

In both the Illinois Guard case and the “reciprocal tariff” case, the question of proportionality arises. Is the threat clearly of so great a magnitude—whether civil unrest in the former case, or external threats of economic harm in the latter—that sweeping powers should be assumed as intentionally granted to the executive by the Congress? The cases could not be superficially more disparate but raise a similar question. How much authority is acceptable to be transferred from other parts of the nation’s governance to the executive?",https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/2026-01/RC2HQHAAS7CQ.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 17:58:43.618584

Videos taken by bystanders with different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The SUV begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the SUV at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.

It was not clear from the videos if the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked on a curb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they’d seen.

Immigration authorities accused the victim, who the Minnesota Star Tribune identified as Renee Nicole Good, of trying to run over officers with her car. In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump defended the ICE agent who shot the victim, saying the agent “seems to have shot her in self defense.”

In a post on X, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith said the driver was a U.S. citizen.

“I’m gathering information, but the situation on the ground is volatile,” Smith said. “ICE should leave now for everyone’s safety. Please be safe Minneapolis.”

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey posted on social media, referring to ICE.

During a press event Wednesday afternoon, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he had issued a “warning order” to the Minnesota National Guard — though the Guard has not been activated — to protect Minnesotans. He blamed the Trump administration for operations that endanger the public, and went on to call on residents in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland to “stand with us.”

“This was so preventable. So unnecessary,” he said. “Maybe we’re at the McCarthy moment. Do you have no decency?”

Chicago had similar shootings involving federal agents

Wednesday’s deadly shooting follows similar incidents reported in the Chicago area during Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation campaign. In one raid, a man was killed, and in another a woman was injured.

Silverio Villegas González, a father and cook originally from Mexico, was shot at “close range” as he allegedly tried to flee from ICE agents who sought to stop his car on Sept. 12 in suburban Franklin Park.

Villegas González was shot in his neck and taken to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, where he was placed on a breathing tube before being pronounced dead less than an hour later, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. A toxicology report showed he had cocaine in his system at the time of the shooting.

Shortly after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported an agent was “seriously injured” when he was “dragged a significant distance” by Villegas González’s car as he fled a stop. DHS officials said the agent had opened fire, fearing for his life.

But body camera footage first obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times shows the federal agent telling local police he was “dragged a little bit.” Speaking over the radio, his partner relays the agent suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands.”

Villegas González had no criminal history, but DHS has said he had “a history of reckless driving” and was in the country without legal status.

A month later, Marimar Martinez, 30, was shot several times for allegedly tailing a Chevrolet Tahoe driven by Border Patrol agent Charles Exum. Martinez allegedly boxed it in and ultimately collided with it.

Exum opened fire, striking Martinez five times, leaving her with seven gunshot wounds. The shooting drew about 100 protesters to the Brighton Park neighborhood, who were met with pepper balls and tear gas deployed by federal agents.

Martinez was charged with assault, but federal prosecutors later dropped the case.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9744c4a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+193/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2Fc0%2F4a9ebbed4fee9a0b76f6882912f4%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:58:39.605314

Among the Republicans defending ICE after the shooting are several members of leadership, including Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and House Republican conference chair Lisa McClain (R-Mich.).

""Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals. May God bless and protect them in their efforts,"" Emmer said in a statement.

What happened: An ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman who drove her vehicle close to federal agents Wednesday morning, Axios' Nick Halter and Kyle Stokes reported.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: ""An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, citing video of the incident, called that account ""bullshit,"" telling reporters, ""Having seen the video myself ... this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying.""

In a video viewed by Axios — filmed a short distance from the scene — someone yells, ""Hey!"" and gunshots are audible as a dark-colored SUV attempts to drive past a gathering of ICE agents and vehicles.

What they're saying: ""This is what happens when Democrats continue to DEMONIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT,"" McClain said in a post on X responding to McLaughlin's statement. ""Praying for all our brave ICE agents who are working to keep us safe.""

The House Republican conference's official X account similarly replied to McLaughlin's statement with a pro-ICE graphic and the caption: ""REPOST IF YOU STAND WITH ICE 🇺🇸""

Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) called the incident a ""targeted assault on ICE agents"" and said she stands ""with the officer who acted in self-defense to save lives.""

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said: ""It appears to, I guess, anybody who sees the video from certain angles, that the driver of the vehicle weaponized that vehicle against law enforcement officers.""

The other side: Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents Minneapolis, called the shooting ""unconscionable and reprehensible"" and called for a ""full, comprehensive investigation and legal action"" against ICE.

""The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law,"" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) both proposed voting down any DHS appropriations bill that ""doesn't restrain the growing lawlessness"" of ICE.

Several Democratic lawmakers also called for ICE to withdraw from Minneapolis and other major American cities, with Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) saying the agency is ""needlessly causing chaos in Minnesota.""

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist when she allegedly tried to run over law enforcement officers during an immigration crackdown in the city, authorities said Wednesday.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot the woman in her vehicle in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It’s at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!” they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

After the shooting, Mayor Jacob Frey said immigration agents were “causing chaos in our city.”

“We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities,” Frey said on social media.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

“We’ve been trying to live life as fully as possible in light of the fear and anxiety that we feel,” said the Rev. Hierald Osorto, pastor at St. Paul’s-San Pablo Lutheran Church, which has a predominantly Latino congregation in the area.

During a news conference in Texas on Wednesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the agency had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noise-making devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

On Tuesday night, the Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session for about 100 people who were willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement operation.

“I feel like I’m an ordinary person, and I have the ability do something so I need to do it,” Mary Moran told KMSP-TV.

These bonds, ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, target select applicants from ""high-risk"" nations for short-term B-1/B-2 visitor visas, refundable only upon full compliance or denial. This Policy transforms lawful travel into a financial privilege, disproportionately excluding poorer, majority non-white populations and entrenching a mobility apartheid that raises profound Human Rights alarms.​

Policy Mechanics and Historical Lineage

The Policy originated as a 2025 State Department pilot addressing elevated visa overstay rates and weak document security, now encompassing 38 states after incorporating 25 new ones, with Africa hit hardest at over 20 countries plus Venezuela. Consular officers impose these sums—often dwarfing years of per-capita income—rendering entry a liquidity test for ordinary citizens.

""The bond scheme is intended to deter visa overstays and ensure 'compliance' with the terms of short-term visas,""

officials maintain, grounding it in Department of Homeland Security overstay analyses.​

Integrated into President Donald Trump's second-term framework, the regime pairs with biometric upgrades and rigorous ""public charge"" evaluations to constrict migration pathways. Its selective application—

""only to some applicants deemed higher overstay risk""

—fosters nationality-based profiling, laced with class and racial undertones, particularly evident in Venezuela amid economic sanctions and geopolitical strains.​

Economic Ripples and Social Exclusion

High bond thresholds threaten to slash tourism, family visits, and business exchanges from listed nations, where scraping together thousands in liquid funds remains elusive for most.

""The high bond levels are expected to depress tourism flows, reduce in-person business links, and complicate family visits from affected countries,""

especially burdensome for African states now numbering 24 on the roster. Diaspora ties weaken, remittances falter, and cultural connections fray under this Policy's weight.​

Such exclusion codifies global hierarchies, where Northern travelers glide unimpeded while Southern ones hit paywalls. Critics invoke ""mobility apartheid,"" akin to historical pass systems, as

""the list largely consists of Global South countries with lower income levels,""

perpetuating unequal mobility through financialized gates. Venezuela's designation, set against ""heightened tensions,"" blends migration controls with broader U.S. pressure tactics.​

The Racialised Underpinnings of Financialised Borders

Financial barriers racialise U.S. borders by proxy, as the roster fixates on Africa and Latin America—majority non-white regions—while sparing Europe and affluent peers despite comparable overstay data. In low-income contexts like Senegal or Nigeria, a $5,000 bond equates to multiple years' earnings, accessible solely to elites.

""Costly visa deposits turn lawful travel into privilege for the wealthy,""

amplifying disparities where mobility tracks wealth often aligned with racial privilege.​

This Policy echoes entrenched patterns, from quota eras to profiling spikes, encoding bias via discretion and risk metrics.

""Rights groups characterize the bonds as a form of 'pay-to-enter' migration control that deepens inequality in mobility,""

spotlighting Human Rights violations in access rationing. Venezuela's inclusion

""exposes political logic behind America’s expanded visa bonds,""

merging enforcement with foreign Policy aims.​

Broader Implications for Global Mobility Equity

The regime accelerates ""pay-to-play"" borders, layering onto digital visa tools and AI checks that already sideline the less affluent.

""Visa bonds export Washington’s migration anxieties onto poorer, dependent states,""

offloading costs while asserting dominance. Diplomatic strains emerge, potentially derailing trade with African Union members or hemispheric deals over Latin inclusions.​

U.S. economies suffer too—fewer visitors from Nigeria or Venezuela dent hospitality sectors in key cities. Yet the Policy delivers political dividends for Trump's base, prioritizing ""tough"" optics over equitable flows. Human Rights standards, from UN mobility pacts, clash with this tiered system, demanding scrutiny of its disparate impacts.​

Human Rights Critiques and Policy Pathologies

Human Rights advocates decry the bonds as discriminatory,

""warn[ing] the policy will effectively price out many ordinary travelers and small businesspeople, viewing it as a discriminatory barrier that falls overwhelmingly on poorer nations.""

By design, the Policy functions as exclusion, not enforcement, violating equality principles in global passage.

""US visa bonds weaponise financial barriers against Global South mobility,""

entrenching apartheid-like divides.​

Geopolitics infuses the Policy further: Venezuela and like cases serve sanction proxies, isolating foes under migration guise. This financial Policy tests international norms, inviting reciprocity or boycotts from the Global South.

Toward Dismantling the Apartheid

Dismantling requires legislative caps, indigency waivers, or judicial probes into racial impacts. Global South coalitions could enact mirror Policies, pressuring equity. Awareness campaigns, hammering

After taking questions from the media, the news conference with Noem has now ended.

Stay with us as we bring you the latest on what we learned.

Release of body camera footage up to FBI, Noem says

Noem says the FBI is leading the investigation into the events of the shooting. When asked whether body camera footage from the ICE agents would be released as part of it, she declined to answer, saying it was up to the FBI.

She reiterated the version of events told by federal officials today - that ICE agents were wrapping up another operation and heading back to the office when their vehicle got stuck in the snow.

While they were stuck, the woman blocked their paths and harassed them, Noem said.

Officer who opened fire was 'experienced' agent

Noem is repeatedly pressed about her comments that the officer who opened fire acted in ""self-defence"".

She says the officer is an ""experienced"" agent, but did not provide details on whether he had previously opened fired in the June incident where she says a car was also used as a ""weapon"".

Local officials 'refuse to protect Minnesotans', says Noem

Noem blames local Democratic leaders for not enforcing federal laws, making it necessary for federal officers to be in the city.

The mayor and governor ""refuse to protect Minnesotans, and instead choose to protect the criminals. That's why we're here,"" she claims.

Federal officers in the city are there to ""bring peace"" and have arrested 1,500 ""criminals"" in recent weeks in Minneapolis.

She also references recent fraud allegations made against the city's Somali immigrant community, which have helped fuel the federal crackdown in the city.

ICE agent was hit by a car last summer, says Noem

Noem says an ICE agent injured today was previously hit by a car in June.

He was injured then, too, she says.

""In fact, the very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and dragged him back in June,"" says Noem.

""He sustained injuries at that time as well.""

Noem says 'mob of agitators' was harassing ICE agents

The incident began when law enforcement agents were attempting to remove an ICE vehicle that had gotten stuck in snow, says Noem.

""A mob of agitators that were harassing them all day began blocking them in,"" she says about the crowd that formed around the agents.

The woman, says Noem, was stalking and impeding officers, before making the decision to ""weaponise"" her vehicle in an effort to ""kill"" officers.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to speak shortly

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is in Minneapolis and is scheduled to hold a news conference in a few minutes.

The department oversees a variety of agencies, including immigration enforcement like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which was involved in the deadly shooting earlier in the day.

Noem has said the officer who opened fire was in fear for his life after the woman allegedly tried to use her vehicle as a weapon. She called the incident ""an act of domestic terrorism"".

What do ICE guidelines say when officers can use deadly force?

The shooting is expected to be heavily-scrutinised, and will certainly include a review of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy on when deadly force is permitted.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) falls under DHS, and is subject to the same rules, which were last updated in February 2023.

According to the DHS guidelines, ""deadly force must be objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the [law enforcement agent] at the time force is applied"".

Deadly force can only be used when the officer ""has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury"" to the officer or another person.

The rules add that deadly force ""shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject"" unless the person ""poses an imminent threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person"".

Agents are also ""prohibited from discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle unless the use of deadly force against the operator is justified under standards articulated elsewhere in this policy"".

Agents also must consider ""that hazards that may be posed"" by an out-of-control vehicle.

A state-led investigation of the shooting is already underway, according to Governor Tim Walz.

Minneapolis City Council says Renee Good was 'caring for her neighbors' when she was shot

The Minneapolis City Council shared a statement confirming the identity of the deceased woman as Renee Nicole Good and condemning ICE's actions in the city.

""Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government,"" the statement reads. ""Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

The Council goes on to express support for immigrant communities in the city, and echoed calls from Mayor Jacob Frey for ICE agents to leave immediately.

""Minneapolis is resilient and will not back down as the federal government ramps up their attacks on our community,"" it said.

Analysis: Shooting being characterised in starkly different ways

Anthony Zurcher

North America correspondent

It is almost inevitable that the fatal shooting of a civilian in Minneapolis by an ICE officer will exacerbate already high tensions in the city.

Both the Trump administration and Democratic state and local officials are characterising the incident in starkly different ways.

Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, blamed a “professional agitator” and a “radical left movement of movement of violence and hate”. Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, offered an expletive laced call for immigration enforcement officials to leave the city.

Given that there is video of encounter, the American public will have the opportunity to pass its own judgement.

Minnesota has become a battleground on the immigration issue in recent months, as hundreds of immigration enforcement officials conduct operations in the area.

The increased enforcement comes as Donald Trump has derided the state’s large Somali immigrant population after members of the community were convicted of a widespread fraud in the distribution of federal Covid aid. Allegations of further corruption in state social services led to Tim Walz, the state’s Democratic governor, to abandon his re-election bid last week.

In a press conference earlier, Walz called the shooting “totally predictable” and “total avoidable” but warned against violent protests.

Minnesota Attorney General calls ICE deployment 'reckless'

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says he is monitoring reports of an ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis, in which a woman was killed.

He says reports are still coming in and there are still a lot that officials do not know, but he adds that President Donald Trump's decision to deploy thousands of armed ICE agents to the state ""is causing serious harm and spreading terror throughout our communities"".

He calls the move ""reckless"" and says it is a ""causal factor"" in Wednesday's incident, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.

""I will do everything I can to change this awful path we are on,"" he says, adding that he will work to hold anyone who broke the law accountable.

Shooting occurred near site of another high profile killing by law enforcement

During the news conference, Mayor Frey urged residents to protest peaceful saying the ""city has been through a lot"".

It was a veiled reference to other high profile incidents including the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man by a local police officer. Derek Chauvin was convicted on state charges and sentenced to over 22 years in prison.

Today's shooting occurred in the Powderhorn Park neighbourhood, a short distance from the intersection where Floyd was killed.

Video of the incident went viral sparking large scale protests against police brutality and racism locally before spreading across the nation and internationally.

Avelo Airlines is ending its deportation flights on Jan. 27 after months of harsh criticism and protests. The news comes after Delaware lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would strip state incentives from companies that support the massive nationwide immigration deportation efforts under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition has gathered at the Wilmington Airport since May to pressure the budget airline to drop the deportation flights. Activists in other states have also staged protests against the airline’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts across the country.

Avelo Communications Manager Courtney Goff said in a statement the company will end its participation in the nationwide Department of Homeland Security program and close its Arizona hub.

“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” she said.

Caritas Kerby, co-organizer of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition, said she believes the activism across the country led to Avelo’s decision to end its role in the controversial flights.

“I firmly believe that Avelo is folding due to the pressure campaigns all over the country,” she said. “It’s been months and months and months of hard work, late nights, meetings, coordination of a bunch of different organizations, and it’s feeling like a really big win.”

Goff denies that Avelo had a contract with the federal government to provide deportation flights, in spite of the company confirming to several media outlets in April that it agreed to provide ICE with flights to support “deportation efforts.”

“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Andrew Levy, Avelo Airlines founder and CEO, said in a statement published by Houston Public Media in April. “After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.”

Goff told WHYY News that Avelo was a subcontractor of CSI Aviation, which is currently the prime contractor for ICE deportation flights. According to the official tracker of federal government spending, CSI Aviation to date has been paid more than $560 million for ICE deportation flights.

Data from Human Rights First, a nonprofit group that tracks ICE flights, shows Avelo did fly deportation flights. The group’s report said the Trump administration conducted at least 11,192 ICE air charter flights from January through the end of November 2025, with Avelo serving about 17% of all November flights.

“We did do government flying, we are not disputing that,” Goff said in an emailed statement.

Proposed bills target Avelo Airlines’ economic incentives

A pair of Delaware lawmakers filed measures last month to address Avelo’s connection to ICE. The resolution and bill are sponsored by state Sen. Ray Seigfried, D-Talleyville, and Rep. Mara Gorman, D-Newark. Gorman said her constituents have been unhappy that Avelo has been profiting from these deportation flights. While Avelo did not run those flights out of Delaware, it did in other states, with a hub in Mesa, Arizona.

Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 would urge the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport, to prohibit agreements or incentives to businesses with ICE contracts that help deport individuals who have not been afforded sufficient due process protections.

Senate Bill 207 would remove a financial incentive for commercial airlines that operate ICE flights that include detainees who lack a valid judicial warrant or have not received required due process rights.

While the Senate bill’s language is broad, it would have potentially impacted Avelo’s jet fuel tax exemption and DRBA marketing incentives.

“We have every right to say how we’re going to provide financial incentives to an organization that’s violating a person’s due process,” Siegfried said.

In a statement, DRBA spokesperson James Salmon said that “while the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority.”

DRBA could make deal with second ICE contractor

The proposed legislation could prevent or eliminate incentives on a possible lease agreement between DRBA and Daedalus Aviation Group at the Wilmington Airport.

Last month, DHS paid Virginia-based Daedalus nearly $140 million to buy six Boeing 737s to use in deportation flights. Top company officials also head a separate company that has a nearly $1 billion contract to support “self deportations.” Daedalus did not respond to a request for comment.

Gorman said the bills are needed because Delawareans should know about companies operating inside the state that may be profiting off of the deportation of people without legal documentation who have been denied due process.

“[The resolution] asks DRBA to review the existing contracts, apply greater scrutiny to future agreements involving companies that conduct ICE deportation flights,” Gorman said. “And basically says that if public money is being used, the public deserves transparency and accountability about where those dollars are going.”

Members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition said they’re concerned the DRBA is trying to hide a possible deal with Daedalus Aviation because of its work helping ICE deport people who don’t have the proper documents to be in the country.

The DRBA is a bi-state government agency that owns and operates several transportation hubs across New Jersey and Delaware. It is run by a board of commissioners appointed by each state’s governor and is funded by tolls, user fees, ticket sales and retail transactions.

Rebekah Rodriguez, a member of the coalition, said she supports the lawmakers’ efforts.

“We think the legislation is important to increase transparency, to try to make sure that there’s no private profit off of the illegal deportations of our neighbors, and make sure that our institutions and representatives are being accountable,” she said.

DRBA pulls Daedalus agenda item after public scrutiny, revises agenda

The Delaware River and Bay Authority was expected to consider the Daedalus Aviation lease agreement at its Dec. 16 meeting.

Rodriguez said some activists showed up to the meeting to voice their concerns after seeing the lease agreement item on the agenda. She said the board quickly pulled it once the meeting started.

“Our community members showed up at that meeting and it was local clergy, parents and wage workers in our community,” she said. “When the DRBA saw us there, even though they are a public entity and they are answerable to the people of Delaware, they abruptly just took that resolution off and went into an executive session.”

WHYY News obtained the agenda that lists the lease agreement item from members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition. That agenda is no longer on the economic development agency’s website.

DRBA posted a revised agenda where the resolution number of the lease agreement now discusses employee retirement plans. Salmon did not respond to follow up questions from WHYY News.

Kerby said that while she considers the Avelo decision a win, her group will continue to pressure companies in the state not to do business with ICE.

“We are still going to be fighting in Delaware,” she said. “We have more work to do, but we’re celebrating how powerful we can be together.”

Delaware DOJ says DRBA not subject to state public records laws

It’s unclear if taking down the original agenda and replacing it with one that removes the mention of the lease agreement would violate Delaware open records laws.

That’s because the bi-state agency is not subject to either states’ Freedom of Information laws, according to a 2020 Delaware FOIA legal opinion. DOJ lawyers said the agency adopted its own FOIA policy in 1990. Questions to Salmon about the legality of altering the December agenda went unanswered.

“DRBA contends that it is not subject to unilateral legislation, as relevant caselaw and the language of the compact itself do not permit any additional duties or obligations be undertaken by DRBA without the express authorization of both states,” the DOJ opinion reads.

That legal decision said DRBA could be subject to either of the states’ FOIA laws by passing legislation. If the states chose to do so, the bill must contain a direct statement that they intend to amend the compact under which DRBA was created to make those laws apply.

This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the deployment of the barriers Wednesday during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley that included a roundtable discussion with U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel as well as ranchers whose property is often traversed by migrants moving north after crossing the border.

Standing before one of the buoys — large floating, cylindrical devices that can measure up to 15 feet long and four to five feet in diameter — Noem said 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and were beginning to be installed that day.

This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology. The projects are funded by the 2025 tax and spending megabill, which Trump named the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Noem touted the water barrier as a deterrent to people crossing the border illegally as well as drug smugglers and human traffickers.

Homeland Security and the Border Patrol are working with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission and the state of Texas to ensure proper installation of the buoys, Noem said.

The state of Texas is already familiar with using buoys to deter border crossings. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the installation of a 1,000-foot water barrier along the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass in 2023 as part of his mission to tighten border security, and an additional 1,000 feet of buoys after Trump took office in January 2025.

“Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, press secretary for Abbott, said in a statement Wednesday. “The floating marine barriers deployed by Texas have been a resounding success, and Governor Abbott is proud to work with the Trump Administration and Border Patrol to expand the program. ”

The buoys sparked protests from activists concerned about migrant safety and a complaint from the Mexican government alleging the buoys violated water treaties between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden sued Texas over the buoys, citing similar concerns. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the buoys to remain in place while the merits of the case move forward in a lower court. The state has argued it has the right to defend itself against an “invasion” of drug cartels.

Weeks after the buoy wall was installed in Eagle Pass, Mexican authorities reported a migrant had been found dead, caught on one of the floating spheres. On Wednesday, Noem argued that the water barrier would prevent migrant deaths by discouraging them from trying to cross the river.

“They’ll create a safer environment for agents on patrol, and securing our waterways not only protects Americans, it saves the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water,” Noem said.

The nonpartisan budget office projected that U.S. population will grow from 349 million people this year to 364 million people in 30 years, a 2.2% smaller gain than it had predicted at this time a year ago. In September, the office issued a revised demographics report that showed Trump’s plans for mass deportations and other strict immigration measures would result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next 10 years.

The country's total population is projected to stop growing in 2056 and remain roughly the same size as in the previous year, the CBO said. But without immigration, the population would begin to shrink in 2030 as deaths start to exceed births, making immigrants an increasingly important source of population growth, according to the report.

The figures released Wednesday are used by the CBO for budget projections and economic forecasts.

Even if the limits on immigration and increased deportations end with the Trump administration in three years, “it’s still a demographic shock,” said William Frey, a demographer at the centrist Brookings Institution.

Social Security and Medicare, which are already buckling under an aging population, will be under increasing pressure with even fewer than expected people in the labor force paying taxes. By the end of the decade, all of the nation’s baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, will be over age 65.

With fewer immigrants in the labor force and projections for U.S. fertility rates showing a long-term decline below replacement levels, ""that reduces the number of kids who are going to be born in that four-year period” of the second Trump administration, Frey said.

The latest numbers come as Trump has pushed for the largest mass deportation campaign in history. The CBO's numbers account for the success of those efforts in the first year of his second term in office.

The administration has used a variety of methods to remove people from the country, including through a visa ban on applications for immigrants from some countries and deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in U.S. cities to track down immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Trump’s tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, included roughly $150 billion to ramp up his deportation agenda over the next four years. This includes money for extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, building detention centers and adding thousands of law enforcement staff.

When it comes to estimating the nation’s population and future growth, immigration is always the wild card because it varies much more year to year than the number of births and deaths. Immigration has fueled U.S. population growth this decade because of an aging population and fertility lower than the replacement rate, with the number of deaths expected to start exceeding the number of births in about five years. The U.S. Census Bureau said that immigration increased by 2.8 million people in 2024 over the previous year.

Since Trump returned to office in January 2025, though, demographers and economists have struggled to decipher the impact of his policies on immigrant growth in the United States.

The bureau’s population estimates for last year have not been released yet, but the Current Population Survey estimated that the number of adult immigrants fell by 1.8 million people from January to November 2025. But those numbers have come under scrutiny, with some experts claiming they may reflect a decline in participation by immigrants in the survey rather than a dramatic drop in immigrant numbers.

Last September, the CBO reduced its immigration estimate for 2025 by 1.6 million people, and Pew last year estimated that the number of immigrants dropped by 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, from a high of 53.3 million immigrants in January 2025.

“These immigrants bring both themselves and the potential for children in the near term,” Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, said in an email. “They contribute both to the labor force through their arrival but also to the potential future growth of the US population through their potential to have children in the near term.”

Julie BosmanMitch Smith and

State and local officials demanded an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota after a federal officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Details remained in dispute, with President Trump saying the agents had acted in self-defense on social media, while state and local officials described federal accounts of the shooting with terms like “propaganda” and “garbage.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement that an agent had opened fire after a woman “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to kill federal officers, while the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, described the incident as “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Mayor Jacob Frey called that account “bullshit,” describing the shooting instead as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota posted on social media, “Don’t believe this propaganda machine.”

In an afternoon news conference, the governor said the shooting was predictable. “We have been warning for weeks that the Trump administration’s dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety,” Mr. Walz said, adding that it cost a person her life on Wednesday.

He directly addressed the president and Ms. Noem, telling them, “You’ve done enough.”

Here’s what we’re covering:

What videos show: Three videos of the shooting posted on social media and verified by The New York Times show two federal agents trying to get a woman to exit a vehicle that is partially blocking a street. The driver reverses, then pulls forward and begins to turn. A third agent pulls out a gun and fires a shot, then continues firing as the vehicle moves past him. Read more ›

Victim unidentified: City officials have not named the woman who was killed, though Mayor Frey cited her age. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes the shooting scene, described the person as a “legal observer.” The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said there was “nothing to indicate that this woman was the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity.”

Calls for calm: Governor Walz asked for people to protest peacefully as about a thousand people gathered at the scene, chanting for immigration agents to leave and throwing snowballs at the police. Mr. Walz said the state’s National Guard troops were prepared to deploy if protests got out of hand. The shooting was about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020. Read more ›

Federal crackdown: About 2,000 federal agents were expected to take part in the immigration enforcement operation, which could last for weeks, according to the Trump administration. Federal officials have framed the crackdown as a response to illegal immigration and widespread fraud in state social service systems. Read more ›

Other shootings: Federal agents enforcing immigration laws have been involved in several shootings in recent months, including in the Chicago and Los Angeles areas. At least 10 such shootings have been reported by news outlets since President Trump returned to office.

Video reporter

Videos circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times show the shooting of a woman by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, as well as the moments immediately before and after.

A maroon Honda Pilot is stopped on Portland Avenue, apparently blocking one lane of the snowy residential street. The driver rolls forward slightly, then stops and waves at approaching vehicles, signaling that they should drive past.

The videos show the driver wave one vehicle by. When a truck with flashing lights approaches, she waves again, but the truck stops and federal agents emerge.

Two step out and move toward the driver’s side. The agents tell the driver to get out.

One of the agents tries to open the driver’s side door and reaches through the window. A third agent crosses in front of the Honda, as the driver begins to reverse, turning to drive away from the agents.

Immediately after the Honda shifts from reverse into drive and begins to move ahead, that agent at the front of the vehicle, standing near the driver’s side headlight, pulls out a gun and aims at the driver.

The Honda moves forward, turning to the right. The agent aiming the gun fires, and continues to shoot as the vehicle moves past him.

The Honda accelerates, colliding with two parked vehicles and a light post. The agent who fired approaches the vehicle, then walks away and tells other agents to call 911.

The Minneapolis neighborhood where federal immigration officers fatally shot a woman on Wednesday is less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020.

The death of Mr. Floyd, on May 25, 2020, threw the community and the nation into a period of unrest, with widespread calls to view policing differently.

On Wednesday, hundreds were gathering once again, just blocks away from the site of Mr. Floyd’s killing, to protest the presence of the federal agents who shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car.

The tree-lined, mostly residential neighborhoods surrounding the scene are some of the most diverse in the city, with fairly large Hispanic and Black populations.

“We’re a really connected area, a community-centric neighborhood,” said Alex Stillman, 37, who lives near where the shooting took place and was inside when it happened. “Most people know each other or know how to get in contact with each other.”

For decades, the community has been home to working-class activists with far-left political leanings. Locals often brag that the biggest day of the year there is the May Day parade celebrating laborers.

Several years ago, a large homeless encampment sprawled across Powderhorn Park, a large park several blocks from Wednesday’s shooting. It has since been mostly cleared out by city and park officials. But both the encampment and heightened attention after Mr. Floyd’s death brought increased car traffic and crime into the neighborhood.

Federal agents have been stationed in Minneapolis since December and ramped up their presence this month, leading to clashes with immigration rights activists across the city.

Mitch Smith and

Local officials in Minneapolis called on federal forces to leave the city in a news conference on Wednesday afternoon after tensions flared when a woman was fatally shot during a confrontation with immigration agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, punctuated his call for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to get “out of Minneapolis” with an expletive, adding that the presence of the agents was sowing chaos in the city.

“People are being hurt,” he said. “Families are being ripped apart.”

Mr. Frey also urged residents to stay calm. He said that the Trump administration wanted to provoke a response that would justify a more forceful federal intervention and he called on residents to “show them something far more beautiful than the kind of division that they’re trying to stoke.”

Elliott Payne, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, also condemned the presence of ICE in Minneapolis during an interview from the scene.

“They’re an escalating factor, he said. “We need them out of our city.”

Homeland Security officials said the shooting happened during an immigration enforcement operation as agents were being confronted by protesters.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the woman who was shot had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” She added that the ICE agent had feared for his life and fired the shots defensively.

But Mr. Frey said he had viewed video footage of the shooting and he maintained that the version of events put out by DHS was incorrect.

Federal officials have defended the overall crackdown in Minneapolis as a necessary response to illegal immigration and widespread fraud in state social service systems.

Last year, the Trump administration launched several aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Democratic cities, where protesters have confronted agents that have sometimes led to violent clashes.

Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser under President Trump’s administration simply described the incident on social media as “domestic terrorism.”

The attorney general of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, said on social media that there were a lot of unknowns surrounding the shooting. But he said that President Trump’s decision to send armed ICE agents to the state is “spreading terror throughout our communities.”

Avelo Airlines is ending its deportation flights on Jan. 27 after months of harsh criticism and protests. The news comes after Delaware lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would strip state incentives from companies that support the massive nationwide immigration deportation efforts under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition has gathered at the Wilmington Airport since May to pressure the budget airline to drop the deportation flights. Activists in other states have also staged protests against the airline’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts across the country.

Avelo Communications Manager Courtney Goff said in a statement the company will end its participation in the nationwide Department of Homeland Security program and close its Arizona hub.

“The program provided short-term benefits, but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” she said.

Caritas Kerby, co-organizer of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition, said she believes the activism across the country led to Avelo’s decision to end its role in the controversial flights.

“I firmly believe that Avelo is folding due to the pressure campaigns all over the country,” she said. “It’s been months and months and months of hard work, late nights, meetings, coordination of a bunch of different organizations, and it’s feeling like a really big win.”

Goff denies that Avelo had a contract with the federal government to provide deportation flights, in spite of the company confirming to several media outlets in April that it agreed to provide ICE with flights to support “deportation efforts.”

“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,” Andrew Levy, Avelo Airlines founder and CEO, said in a statement published by Houston Public Media in April. “After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.”

Goff told WHYY News that Avelo was a subcontractor of CSI Aviation, which is currently the prime contractor for ICE deportation flights. According to the official tracker of federal government spending, CSI Aviation to date has been paid more than $560 million for ICE deportation flights.

Data from Human Rights First, a nonprofit group that tracks ICE flights, shows Avelo did fly deportation flights. The group’s report said the Trump administration conducted at least 11,192 ICE air charter flights from January through the end of November 2025, with Avelo serving about 17% of all November flights.

“We did do government flying, we are not disputing that,” Goff said in an emailed statement.

Proposed bills target Avelo Airlines’ economic incentives

A pair of Delaware lawmakers filed measures last month to address Avelo’s connection to ICE. The resolution and bill are sponsored by state Sen. Ray Seigfried, D-Talleyville, and Rep. Mara Gorman, D-Newark. Gorman said her constituents have been unhappy that Avelo has been profiting from these deportation flights. While Avelo did not run those flights out of Delaware, it did in other states, with a hub in Mesa, Arizona.

Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 would urge the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport, to prohibit agreements or incentives to businesses with ICE contracts that help deport individuals who have not been afforded sufficient due process protections.

Senate Bill 207 would remove a financial incentive for commercial airlines that operate ICE flights that include detainees who lack a valid judicial warrant or have not received required due process rights.

While the Senate bill’s language is broad, it would have potentially impacted Avelo’s jet fuel tax exemption and DRBA marketing incentives.

“We have every right to say how we’re going to provide financial incentives to an organization that’s violating a person’s due process,” Siegfried said.

In a statement, DRBA spokesperson James Salmon said that “while the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority.”

DRBA could make deal with second ICE contractor

The proposed legislation could prevent or eliminate incentives on a possible lease agreement between DRBA and Daedalus Aviation Group at the Wilmington Airport.

Last month, DHS paid Virginia-based Daedalus nearly $140 million to buy six Boeing 737s to use in deportation flights. Top company officials also head a separate company that has a nearly $1 billion contract to support “self deportations.” Daedalus did not respond to a request for comment.

Gorman said the bills are needed because Delawareans should know about companies operating inside the state that may be profiting off of the deportation of people without legal documentation who have been denied due process.

“[The resolution] asks DRBA to review the existing contracts, apply greater scrutiny to future agreements involving companies that conduct ICE deportation flights,” Gorman said. “And basically says that if public money is being used, the public deserves transparency and accountability about where those dollars are going.”

Members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition said they’re concerned the DRBA is trying to hide a possible deal with Daedalus Aviation because of its work helping ICE deport people who don’t have the proper documents to be in the country.

The DRBA is a bi-state government agency that owns and operates several transportation hubs across New Jersey and Delaware. It is run by a board of commissioners appointed by each state’s governor and is funded by tolls, user fees, ticket sales and retail transactions.

Rebekah Rodriguez, a member of the coalition, said she supports the lawmakers’ efforts.

“We think the legislation is important to increase transparency, to try to make sure that there’s no private profit off of the illegal deportations of our neighbors, and make sure that our institutions and representatives are being accountable,” she said.

DRBA pulls Daedalus agenda item after public scrutiny, revises agenda

The Delaware River and Bay Authority was expected to consider the Daedalus Aviation lease agreement at its Dec. 16 meeting.

Rodriguez said some activists showed up to the meeting to voice their concerns after seeing the lease agreement item on the agenda. She said the board quickly pulled it once the meeting started.

“Our community members showed up at that meeting and it was local clergy, parents and wage workers in our community,” she said. “When the DRBA saw us there, even though they are a public entity and they are answerable to the people of Delaware, they abruptly just took that resolution off and went into an executive session.”

WHYY News obtained the agenda that lists the lease agreement item from members of the Delaware Stop Avelo Coalition. That agenda is no longer on the economic development agency’s website.

DRBA posted a revised agenda where the resolution number of the lease agreement now discusses employee retirement plans. Salmon did not respond to follow up questions from WHYY News.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/avelo_airlines_plane.png,N,,2026-01-07 21:57:14.402263

Rubio told reporters that he described a threefold process to lawmakers on Venezuela that revolved around oil: first, stabilization of the country; next, finding access for companies to the Venezuelan market; and the final phase, “one of transition”.

“We are going to take between 30 and 50m barrels of oil,” Rubio said. “We’re going to sell it in the marketplace at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting.”

Oil aside, the operation has split Washington along predictable lines. Republicans have rallied behind Trump’s characterization of the raid as a straightforward law enforcement action to arrest an indicted drug trafficker. Democrats warn of an illegal act of war that could plunge Venezuela into chaos and set a dangerous precedent for unilateral presidential action.

“What we did is we took out an illegitimate president,” the Republican senator Markwayne Mullin said after the briefing. “He was never duly elected, so there can’t be regime change if he should have never been put in place to begin with.”

On early Saturday morning, special operations forces struck multiple targets across northern Venezuela, captured Maduro and Flores from their home, ferried them to the USS Iwo Jima, flew them to the Stewart air national guard base, then delivered them to New York. Days later, Maduro stood in federal court pleading not guilty to “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, cocaine importation and weapons charges stemming from a 2020 indictment.

Senator Chris Murphy was incredulous coming out of the confidential briefing, telling reporters the Trump administration is “going to take the oil by force, by force”.

“This is an insane plan,” Murphy said. “They are talking about stealing Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time, undefined as leverage to micromanage the country.” He added that he “heard no detailed plan” on Venezuela’s stability.

Across Capitol Hill after the follow-up briefing to the House, Democrats were similarly taken aback by the brazenness of the president’s campaign to cut out Venezuela’s dictatorship without consulting Congress. New York congressman Gregory Meeks said it was all the more reason to look at another war powers resolution.

“You better believe they would have a different position if this was Joe Biden,” Meeks said about the Republicans. “We’re being treated like the Duma in Russia, where Vladimir Putin does not have to consult the Duma. He just does whatever the heck he wants to do. And that’s what’s happening here to the American people.”

The push reflects broader public unease about the operation. More than six in 10 Americans believe it should have required congressional approval, according to a Washington Post poll released on Sunday. A separate Reuters/Ipsos survey found roughly three-quarters express concern the US will become too involved in Venezuela. Overall public opinion mirrors the partisan split on Capitol Hill, with the Reuters poll showing about one-third approving the operation, one-third disapproving and one-third unsure.

“Across America, people are just saying: what the hell is going on?” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said. “We need answers as to how long this is going to last. We need answers to how many troops, how much money, are there guardrails, things we don’t do, and a number of things that we had talked about were very troubling.”

But the question on what happens next in Venezuela is still unclear. Trump has said the US would “run” the country for an unspecified period and has allowed the country’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, a handpicked and supposed Maduro loyalist, to remain in a leadership role for now.

“The reality is the entire Maduro apparatus is still intact, and we know every other regime, if nothing else, it’s about self-preservation,” the Democratic senator from Vermont Peter Welch said. “So what you have here is a situation where everyone is in great admiration of the capacity of our military and how they did something that was extraordinarily dangerous and complicated, but there is no answer about what comes next.”

International condemnation has been swift. Brazil, Chile, China, France, Iran, Mexico, Russia and Spain have all denounced the operation. At the UN security council on Sunday, Russian and Chinese representatives demanded Maduro’s immediate release while the US defended the action as targeted law enforcement.

Republican lawmakers and US officials are also narrowing their sights toward Greenland, in the name of national security.

“The other thing I would point out, China and Russia are operating off the coast of Greenland,” the Republican senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri said. “Denmark is not capable of protecting Greenland, and so in my view, we have a very keen interest in Greenland.”

Trump has kept a naval fleet positioned off Venezuela’s coast, and this morning the US Coast Guard seized two Venezuela-linked oil tankers in separate operations, signaling the administration has no plans to ease pressure on the regime.

“Our military is prepared to continue this,” Hegseth told reporters. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He’s not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”

Congress is poised to further balloon opens in a new tab the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) already bloated budget, expanding ICE’s sprawling detention apparatus opens in a new tab at a time of record deaths opens in a new tab in detention. It would provide billions to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds DHS received last summer, including for private prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, we have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, leading to the detention of longtime residents, children, and even U.S. citizens. Passing this bill and giving DHS more money to detain our neighbors is dangerous and may lead to irreversible harm.

Congress reportedly is nearing an agreement to fund DHS for 44,500 immigration detention beds opens in a new tab, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to abduct and deport more people at any given day than ever before. This number is up from 41,500 beds appropriated for FY24 and would be layered on top of the beds ICE is already spending on with the unprecedented $45 billion that Congress allocated as part of the 2025 reconciliation bill. This is especially alarming given reports that ICE is planning to erect new warehouse gulags opens in a new tab for potentially over 80,000 people at a time. At Fort Bliss opens in a new tab, the nation’s largest detention site, we have already seen people exposed to brutal conditions, including sexual abuse, overcrowding, and inadequate food; we expect these warehouses to similarly be sites of humanitarian catastrophe and immense suffering.

ICE is currently detaining a record-breaking population of over 68,000 people opens in a new tab with deadly consequences—six people died in ICE custody in December 2025 alone, during the deadliest year opens in a new tab for people in detention in decades. Further, there is also nothing in this bill that prevents the administration from using this added funding to detain families, including young children, hundreds of whom have been detained for months in facilities without safe drinking water, medical care opens in a new tab, education, or access to lawyers. This is a system that needs oversight, not another windfall in funds. Passing this bill would signal Congress’ consent to this dangerous and exploding network of detention sites at the very moment that our communities need their representatives to hold ICE accountable.

This critical funding fight comes as our communities are facing persistent militarized enforcement operations by masked agents, leading to the separation of hundreds of children from their parents and caregivers opens in a new tab, and a nationwide, racial profiling opens in a new tab operation ensnaring immigrants and U.S. citizens opens in a new tab alike. This moment presents an opportunity for Congress to push back. Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Sen. Murray released a statement opens in a new tab criticizing Senate Republicans for choosing to release a partisan bill to fund DHS and called for more accountability from President Trump’s “out-of-control DHS.” As the Appropriations Committees negotiate a bicameral conferenced version of the Homeland Security bill, we urge Congress to oppose any additional funds for ICE and use this bill to rein in the Trump administration’s reckless abuse and assault on our communities under the guise of immigration enforcement.

For working-class and poor people in developing countries, there are limited options to attaining legal status in the U.S.","For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Brady Brickner-Wood is filling in for Kyle Chayka.

Late last year, the White House’s social-media team lauded ICE’s torrential deportation efforts with a string of memes seemingly engineered to go viral. In one video posted to Instagram, the song “all-american bitch,” by Olivia Rodrigo, provides a soundtrack to a montage of deportees being forced onto buses and planes; in another, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Juno” plays as ICE agents accost people in the streets, the lyric “Have you ever tried this one?” repeating each time a new person is detained. Another video uses the satirical song “Big Boys,” from a “Saturday Night Live” skit featuring SZA, as agents handcuff people in parking lots. A line from the song—“It’s cuffing season”—flashes in all caps across the screen. Rodrigo, Carpenter, and SZA have denounced the videos as “hateful,” “evil,” and “peak dark,” respectively. (In response to Carpenter, the White House doctored a video promoting her own “S.N.L.” appearance to make it seem as if she said she would “arrest” the cast member Marcello Hernández for being “too illegal.”) Unlike other cases of Trump using musicians’ songs, against their will, at rallies or in campaign materials—Beyoncé, Adele, and Jack White, among them—these videos are not one-off inanities or easily ignorable promotional assets. Instead, they are part of a hundred-million-dollar “wartime recruitment” effort, according to an internal document obtained by the Washington Post, aimed at hiring thousands more deportation officers in the new year, a propaganda crusade intended to portray ICE as a team of Avengers valiantly defending American soil from a malevolent foreign terror. By splicing pop songs and familiar meme formats into cruel detainment footage, ICE strains to attract a younger demographic, hoping to convince people that the agency is a vibrant—and trollishly funny—organization engaged in the noble work of putting away bad guys. Oh, the pop stars got mad? Joke’s on them. Now even more people know ICE is hiring.

The Trump Administration has pledged to deport a million immigrants each year during the President’s second term—even, it appears, if the immigrants have not committed crimes or are lawfully residing in the U.S. This past summer, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress increased ICE’s budget to more than a hundred and seventy billion dollars across the next four years, netting out to an annual allocation that is more than the combined yearly budgets of all local and state law-enforcement agencies in the country. ICE has used some of this money to go on a hiring spree; the agency recently announced that it had signed up twelve thousand new officers and agents—a hundred-and-twenty-per-cent increase to its workforce.

Some of these new ICE agents may have been lured in by the ads running on national television, or by the promotional content appearing on social-media sites and streaming services. On platforms such as Hulu, HBO Max, Snapchat, Spotify, and YouTube, pre-roll and automated ads have begun popping up with alarming frequency. “Join the mission to protect America,” a narrator says, in one recent ad that appeared on Spotify. In another ad specifically targeting local law-enforcement officers in Chicago, an apocalyptic vision of America is reinforced: “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.” According to the internal document obtained by the Post, ICE hopes to target prospective hires through location-based marketing tactics like geofencing, a technology that allows the agency to send ads to the phones of people in specific locations, such as college campuses, gun and trade shows, military bases, and Nascar races. ICE has also allotted funds for right-wing influencers and streamers to promote hiring efforts, and flooded official Department of Homeland Security and ICE social-media feeds with memes. “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” one graphic posted to X and Instagram reads; another image shows a classic car parked on a beach with the header “America After 100 Million Deportations.”

The U.S. government has, of course, never been shy about its spending on defense advertising. In 2023, the Department of Defense’s total advertising budget was $1.1 billion, with the bulk of the funds being directed to military-recruitment efforts; in 2025, the Army’s advertising budget alone surpassed a billion dollars. Still, what makes the D.H.S.’s spending on ICE advertising so disorienting is not only how the agency is being branded as another branch of the military—a domestic war organization hellbent on eradicating a rival militant force—but how it has weaponized social media and digital culture against itself, a somewhat novel strategy for a governmental department. Traditional military calls to action, sometimes combined with white-supremacist tropes, are being deployed in the many memes and A.I.-generated images that the D.H.S. and the White House post daily to TikTok, X, and Instagram, such as Uncle Sam beckoning prospective recruits to save the country, or a nineteenth-century Manifest Destiny painting captioned with the slogan “A Heritage to Be Proud Of, a Homeland Worth Defending.” Anxieties about the border are hardly new, but they have been embellished to dangerous, deranged degrees during Trump’s second term. To declare war on immigrants, many of whom are fleeing persecution and violence fomented by past American interventionism, requires a powerful, blinding narrative strong enough to smokescreen the degradation and dehumanization at the core of the messaging. “The light will defeat the dark,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s White House deputy chief of staff, declared at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, in September. “We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil. They cannot imagine what they have awakened.” Protect the homeland. Remove the invaders. Destroy the aliens. The dog whistles have turned into fire alarms.

Trump’s time in office has obliterated the pretense that there’s any meaningful separation between the state and corporate interests. The decisions and forces that affect society, that dictate the livelihoods and well-being of its citizens, are at the mercy of the market, and the now frighteningly transparent ways that the market serves and benefits its dutiful governmental benefactors. Trump, conflating his politics with capitalist preponderance, has realized that to further his political and economic power, he must activate the state’s most powerful asset: the War Department. Threatening to occupy Greenland. Overthrowing the Venezuelan government and laying claim to its oil reserves. And, crucially, deploying the National Guard into U.S. cities, declaring a domestic war against a fabricated enemy: those who have altered the imagined portrait of the American pastoral.

When defenders of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies cite the possibility of legal immigration, they, too, are perpetuating the reality that market supremacy has usurped legislative processes. For working-class and poor people in developing countries, there are limited options to attaining legal status in the U.S. But if a person seeking status is already wealthy or attains corporate sponsorship, for instance, a viable pathway to citizenship opens up, even if only slightly. This prioritization of wealth is no better articulated than in the launch of Trump’s “gold card,” a literal card with Trump’s face on it that, for a million dollars, grants a foreign-born purchaser a visa and a fast track to citizenship. These are the people the Administration believes deserve entry into the country; most anyone else, apparently, is deemed an enemy of the state. ICE’s “wartime recruitment” ads also, paradoxically, prey on those who are struggling to find a way to survive within the bottlenecked economy, people for whom the stable annual salary provided by a job with ICE, and a fifty-thousand-dollar signing bonus, would surely improve their quality of life. The agency also promises a path toward meaning, a heroic call to “fulfill your mission.” The fantasy of fulfillment, the dream of belonging—something the so-called enemy is plenty familiar with. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695d8f8fe9d1cdb554fa06a4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NewYorker_ICEads_Final_animation_v2.png",N,,2026-01-07 16:58:45.311950

The Trump administration deported Edgar Sosa Rojas, 47, without his Venezuelan passport, his wife, Maria Stella Ferrer, told the Herald.","Amid the escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela that resulted in the capture of strongman Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration has been sending Venezuelan immigrants to Mexico since at least December.

The Miami Herald has spoken with Venezuelans immigrants — including a single mother with two young children and a man who had fled government authorities in Venezuela and then a guerilla group in Colombia — and their families. They say they were held in detention centers in Texas before being handed over to Mexican authorities. The Mexican government later sent them by bus to the southern city of Villahermosa, where violence and organized crime has exploded in recent years, as well as the municipality of Palenque, in the state of Chiapas near the border with Guatemala.

“Once I entered immigration detention, I lost everything,” said Omar Vergara Flores, a 36-year-old man who had just purchased a home in Austin with his wife and was planning to acquire a construction franchise.

A shelter administrator in Villahermosa, the capital city of Tabasco, told the Herald his center has received several Venezuelan men, women, and children deported from the U.S. since Caracas announced on Dec. 12 that the United States had unilaterally suspended deportation flights to Venezuela.

U.S. deportations to Venezuela are heavily influenced by the political relations between the two countries. The last U.S. flight sending immigrants to Venezuela was on Dec. 10, according to Human Rights First, an organization that tracks and analyzes deportations, though the U.S. has not publicly announced their suspension. Caracas had previously stopped accepting flights in March 2025, after the Trump administration revoked Chevron’s license to pump petroleum in Venezuela, and again later in the year over U.S. military activity in the Caribbean.

The deportations of Venezuelan detainees to Mexico appear to be part of the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of deportations of immigrants to countries that are not their own, which the administration has negotiated with several countries. Deported and detained Venezuelans, as well as their family members, said immigration agents offered to send them to countries like Honduras, Colombia, Nicaragua and Ecuador, as well as Uganda, an East African nation with no shared language or cultural ties to Venezuela.

The Department of Homeland Security did not answer questions about how many Venezuelans it had sent to Mexico in 2025 or this year, nor under what agreements. Top Mexican immigration officials did not respond to Herald queries about how many Venezuelans U.S. authorities had sent south of the border, whether they would be able to go to the Mexican capital to access consular services, and why they were being transported to southern states with a strong presence of organized crime. The Human Rights Office within the Mexican immigration agency referred the Herald to its communications department.

In an email obtained by the Herald, an Immigration Customs and Enforcement officer told relatives of Vergara Flores that he had been sent to Mexico on Dec. 25 because “all flights to Venezuela are on hold until further notice.” The email’s timing coincided with the U.S. military ramp-up in the Caribbean that culminated in Maduro’s capture in Caracas on Saturday.

“The breaking point for us was when we requested bond [in immigration court] and it was denied, when accused rapists and murderers [in the criminal system] are granted bail,” Vergara Flores said, referring to his own case. His wife, Jennyfer Carrillo, added: “We mean nothing to them.”

Vulnerability in Mexico

July Rodriguez, who founded an organization supporting Venezuelan immigrants in Mexico, has documented at least two different waves of Venezuelans deported from the U.S. since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The first took place in March when Maduro temporarily blocked deportation flights and the Trump administration sent over 200 Venezuelans it accused of being gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador. In December, advocates witnessed another round of deportations to Mexico.

Mexican authorities have stopped sending deported immigrants to Tapachula, a southwestern city, “because organized crime brazenly took over the state of Chiapas, and many Mexicans have had to leave Chiapas, displaced to Guatemala,” Rodriguez told the Herald. But Villahermosa, the new destination, has experienced an explosion in violent crime in recent years.

Leaving Venezuelans in southern Mexico also makes it harder for them to obtain travel documents, since the country has only one Venezuelan consulate, located in Mexico City, a 12-hour bus ride away. There are also fewer legal resources to help deported migrants legalize their status compared to other parts of Mexico.

“The level of vulnerability Venezuelans face in Mexico is extremely serious,” Rodríguez said. “There is no clear policy that allows them to leave the country. Many choose to leave on foot or by bus through Guatemala. Others risk their lives trying to reach Mexico City, while some remain in Mexico with no support.”

‘A nightmare’

Vergara Flores was among those dropped off in the middle of the night in Villahermosa. He has a bachelor’s degree in architecture and another degree in informatics. He was building a stable life with his wife and had even purchased a home after entering the U.S. in 2022 through the Mexican border.

ICE detained him during a routine check-in appointment in June, after he had attended them without issues six other times. In detention, Vergara Flores lost weight and hair due to stress, lack of sunlight and unhealthy food, he said. Nearly seven months later, on Christmas day, he was among dozens deported to Mexico.

The couple’s new house is now on the market.

“He lived only one month in the house,” Carrillo said. “His detention shook our lives and turned it upside down. It was a nightmare that we never thought we would experience. We fought until the very end.”

Vergara Flores had been a beneficiary Temporary Protected Status until April, when the Trump administration began its efforts to strip the deportation protections of over 600,000 Venezuelans.

Carrillo realized her husband was slated for deportation when she could no longer find him in the system she used to send him money while in detention. Friends and relatives of other detainees started sharing on a WhatsApp group that their loved ones were being sent to Mexico.

Vergara Flores is currently waiting for his Venezuelan passport to arrive so he can leave Mexico. Without it, he would be forced to travel by foot or bus toward the Guatemalan border—a dangerous route where criminal groups target migrants.

“He was scared,” his wife said. “I’m still scared for him, but we are starting to see the light.”

Deportations on hold

On the U.S. side of the border, there are Venezuelan waiting for pending court hearings. But those who have already signed voluntary departure documents — often after prolonged detention that detainees, families, and advocates say has taken a toll on migrants’ physical and mental health — have no such option. Vergara Flores, desperate to get out of detention, agreed to depart voluntarily. But he believed he would be sent to Venezuela, not Mexico.

Freddy Villegas, a 31-year-old computer engineer, is among those detained who say the Trump administration offered a one-way ticket to a third country. He fled persecution from paramilitary groups in Caracas in 2021 and entered the United States later that year. He applied for asylum in August 2022, citing threats and fear of return to Venezuela. While his asylum case was still pending, he was granted TPS.

On July 1, ICE detained Villegas during a check-in appointment. He continues to fight for asylum and told the Herald that ICE officials told Venezuelans and Cubans at his detention center that it would be difficult to get their countries’ governments to take them back.

“They offered us the option to resettle in another country, such as Colombia or Mexico, but I refused,” Villegas said. He said he would rather remain in ICE custody, even though his health has suffered, than be sent to a third country or returned to Venezuela, where he fears persecution.

Villegas said he has lost 22 pounds during his detention and developed a vitiligo-like condition, which he attributes in part to prolonged confinement and limited access to sunlight. Some other Venezuelans, however, eventually became exhausted by their circumstances and agreed to be sent to Mexico.

Persecution by guerrillas

Venezuelans deported to Mexico are charting their next steps, but not having legal status there or documentation can make it difficult. The Trump administration deported Edgar Sosa Rojas, 47, without his Venezuelan passport, his wife, Maria Stella Ferrer, told the Herald. That has made leaving Mexico difficult.

Sosa Rojas first fled persecution in Venezuela in 2014, seeking refuge with his family in Colombia, where his wife was born. But safety there was short-lived. A guerrilla group kidnapped Sosa Rojas in December 2023 and later released him in Mexico, according to his wife and documents the Herald reviewed.

The Herald reviewed complaints filed with Colombian government agencies, as well as records from the Institute for Women in Migration, a Mexican organization that advocates for migrant women’s rights in Mexico and the United States.

He sought asylum in the U.S. in 2024, but authorities detained him in August and sent him to Mexico, where he was dropped off near the Guatemalan border.

He is now retracing the same dangerous route through Central America that once brought him to the United States, heading back toward the Colombia–Venezuela border, his wife said. Ferrer fears he could be kidnapped by cartels along the way, again.

“The United States was supposed to be the safest country,” his wife said. “But they deported him instead.”

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, according to federal and local authorities. The shooting occurred less than 24 hours after the Trump administration announced a large-scale immigration crackdown was underway in Minnesota.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents were met by ""rioters"" during a targeted operation. McLaughlin accused the victim of being ""one of these violent rioters"" who ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.""

""An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,"" she added.

Local authorities have raised concerns about the circumstances behind the shooting. At a fiery press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said ICE was ""trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull***. ""

""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,"" he added.

The mayor called on ICE agents to leave the city, asserting that federal immigration authorities were ripping families apart and sowing chaos on Minneapolis streets.

At the same press conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said local police arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound to the head. They performed life-saving measures at the scene, including CPR. The woman was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, he added.

Preliminary information, according to O'Hara, indicates that the woman was in her vehicle and blocking the road on Portland Avenue between 33rd and 34th St.

""At some point, a federal law enforcement approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired,"" he said, adding that the car then crashed on the side of the roadway.

O'Hara said he was ""very concerned"" with the tactics used by federal immigration agents. He noted that the use of deadly force is justified at times, but that most law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are trained to minimize the risks and the need for deadly force.

""In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle of someone who's not armed,"" he said.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when a woman, 37, allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on DHS’s narrative in a press conference Wednesday afternoon.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,"" Frey said, referring to ICE. ""Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is b---s---.""

Video posted to social media shows several agents approaching a burgundy SUV in the middle of the street and ordering the driver to get out. When one agent grabs the driver’s side door handle, the car reverses and then drives forward.

An agent standing near the front of the vehicle appears to draw his firearm and fire three shots at it, the video shows. The vehicle then crashes into a parked car and hits a light pole.

Frey said after the shooting the first priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and the second was to get ICE off the scene because they were ""making a difficult situation more problematic.""

""What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,"" he said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Frey had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

""To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" the mayor said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents' vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman ""attacked them.""

""It was an act of domestic terrorism,"" she said.

The agent fired what McLaughlin said were ""defensive shots"" and killed the woman.

""He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said.

Frey said it did not appear from video of the incident that the vehicle was being weaponized against the agent.

""This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the mayor's news conference.

Aidan Perzana, 31, said he witnessed the incident and it didn't look like the woman was trying to run over an agent.

""I heard that Noem is trying to say they were trying to run down an officer. There was plenty of space between the officers at that point for the vehicle to make it through,"" he told NBC News, adding that it looked like the driver was trying to flee.

Aidan’s wife Grace Perzana, 32, said the family has lived in the neighborhood two and a half years and ""we love it.""

""We are really happy here. We have a giant shark statue in our front yard and our neighbor has a giant T-Rex statue,"" she said. ""There is a lot of community art, a lot of people having barbecues with music in their backyards.""

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make a full recovery. She did not detail what type of injuries the agents sustained.

DHS increasing presence in Minneapolis

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The push has ramped up tensions with local officials in some cities and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts.

In September, in the Chicago area, an ICE agent fatally shot a man during a traffic stop. His family called for justice and local police said the FBI had been investigating the death.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there Wednesday.

DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Grace Perzana said she did not believe there were many people of Somali descent on the street where Wednesday's shooting happened, but said she does have many “Latinx” neighbors.

Many Minnesota residents of Somali descent, including those who are American citizens, have been staying indoors or have reduced activity outside, fearful of being snagged in the stepped-up enforcement now in its second month.",https://ktvz.b-cdn.net/2025/08/Breaking-News-2.png,N,,2026-01-07 17:59:06.490653

""We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and make sure there is an investigation that is conducted in full,"" he said.

Frey blamed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for escalating the situation in the city.

""We dreaded this moment since the early stages of this ICE presence in Minneapolis,"" he said. ""Not only is this a concern we've had internally, but we've been talking about it. They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust.

DHS says driver was trying to ram agents

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that an ICE agent fatally shot a person in a vehicle, claiming that the person was trying to ram agents.

The agency's full statement can be read below:

Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.

An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.

He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.

The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.

This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Videos circulating online show moments before and after the shooting

Videos, appearing to show the moments leading up to and after an ICE agent shot a driver, began circulating on social media Wednesday afternoon.

In the videos, a red Honda Pilot is seen idling, blocking the roadway with the driver's side window down. ICE agents approach in a truck, step out and approach the vehicle, telling the driver to get out using an expletive. One of the agents begins pulling on the handle of the SUV. The driver appears to slowly back, turn to the right and move forward before accelerating. As the driver begins accelerating, at least two gunshots can be heard.

The car continues accelerating for a moment before crashing into a parked car a short way down the street.

ICE agents were near the front driver’s side fender when the driver attempted to accelerate away.

Frey said at the Wednesday press conference that he had viewed the video and said it did not appear the driver was trying to hit ICE agents.

""The narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative,"" Frey said. ""It is not true.""

City officials said there was no indication the woman who was shot was the target of any law enforcement activity.

Leaders, Minnesota residents respond to ICE shooting

At a separate press conference later Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said the state was prepared for protests he expects to take place in the coming days, and urged Minnesotans to ""not take the bait"" from the Trump administration to engage in violence.

""If you protest, and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully as you always do,"" Walz said. ""We can't give them what they want. The hearts and minds of the people in this state are on our side. To Americans, I ask you this: Please stand with Minneapolis. To Minnesotans, know that our administration is going to stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.""

The governor, who announced a day earlier that he would not be seeking reelection, said he was afraid the federal government's actions would lead to escalation.

""We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety; that someone was going to get hurt,"" Walz said. ""Just yesterday, I said exactly that. What we're seeing is a consequence of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV. And today that recklessness caused someone their life.""

Reporters in the area saw more than 100 federal agents descend on the scene near 34th Street and Portland Avenue after the shooting was reported at around 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

According to KARE11 reporters at the scene, a crashed car at the intersection had a bullet hole in the front windshield on the driver's side. Two other cars have wreckage damage. Near the scene, protesters began chanting anti-ICE slogans.

A tense interaction nearby saw protesters throwing snowballs at federal officials. The immigration officials responded with pepper spray and paintballs, which are considered non-lethal crowd control devices.

The incident happened during what the Department of Homeland Security called its ""largest immigration operation ever."" An estimated six hundred agents and investigators are examining alleged fraud in the state.

State Senator Omar Fateh said in a social media post that he's received reports that a doctor at the scene was denied the ability to provide lifesaving CPR by federal law enforcement. In a press conference, Frey said he could not verify this witness account.

A witness showed KARE reporters what appeared to be video of responders attempting to resuscitate someone.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara previously said his department does not enforce immigration laws, according to KARE 11. On Tuesday, he said he appointed a designated supervisor and placed additional officers on standby around the clock due to concerns of potential unrest.

“Every day for the last several weeks has been a challenge,” O’Hara said, adding that his greatest concern is the potential for unrest or a tragedy in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. He asked protesters to remain peaceful and urged federal agents to conduct their work “professionally and lawfully.”

According to DHS, agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Minnesota, including 150 in Minneapolis on Monday.

In a statement on his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump said he had seen at least one of the videos showing the Minneapolis shooting.

""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch,"" he wrote. ""The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.""

The president said he blamed the incident, and others like it over the past several months, on left-leaning protesters interfering with ICE operations.

""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,"" Trump wrote. ""They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""",https://media.khou.com/assets/CCT/images/ae8e45e7-b89f-4826-bc06-33590809ddf9/20260107T172437/ae8e45e7-b89f-4826-bc06-33590809ddf9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 16:58:56.227949

Congressional forecasters have lowered their projection of population growth over the next decade by 7 million people, in response to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown as well as falling birth rates.

The U.S. population is now projected to grow from 349 million this year to 357 million in 2035, according to a forecast released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.

That's slower growth than CBO was predicting a year ago. The biggest reason for the downshift is the administration's aggressive effort to cut down on illegal immigration. The U.S. also admitted fewer foreign students in 2025, although the number of authorized green card holders is expected to increase over the next decade.

In addition to slowing immigration, people in the U.S. are having fewer children, which is also putting the brakes on population growth. By 2030, the CBO estimates there will be fewer babies born in the U.S. each year than there are deaths. Absent immigration, the population would begin to shrink at that point.

Immigration also helps to boost birth rates, since foreign-born women have more children, on average, than women born in the U.S.

The demographic outlook helps to shape CBO's annual economic forecast, which will be released next month.

Analysts caution that the long-run forecasts of births, deaths and immigration are uncertain and small changes in any of those factors could significantly change the population over time.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3696x2079+0+193/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2Fbf%2F78c58a9841d882cfc881f35bf44f%2Fgettyimages-2249757777.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:57:44.762609

Associated Press

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it launched what it described as the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out by the agency — with 2,000 federal agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper sprayed.","Federal agents shot and killed a woman during a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Ilhan Omar, the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman, said the victim was “a legal observer” of action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which had sent a surge of agents into the city in recent days tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A witness to the incident, Emily Heller, told local media that the victim was shot in the face multiple times. Heller said she saw a car blocking traffic that appeared to be part of a protest against the ICE operation, and heard an agent telling the driver, a woman, to “get out of here”.

“She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of her car, and he pulled out a gun and put it right in – like his midriff was on her bumper – and he reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face like three, four times,” Heller told MPR News, a Minneapolis public radio station.

A video posted to social media and another video obtained by the Guardian appeared to capture the moment of the shooting as a dark red SUV drove away from agents moving toward it, although the front of the vehicle is obscured.

In a post to X, the homeland security department (DHS) insisted the person was a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted “to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them”.

The department claimed several ICE officers were hurt, but said that they were expected to make “full recoveries”.

“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” the DHS post said.

The videos mentioned above appear to contradict that statement, as it shows the SUV clearly backing up away from ICE officers as they approach. There is one ICE officer that can be seen partially in front of the car as the car moves forward and then away from the officers. That same ICE officer is seen firing his gun as the car appears to drive by him. Three gunshots can be heard ringing out.

There is no visible sign in the videos of ICE officers being injured. The agent who appeared to have fired the fatal shots is seen returning to a silver SUV that was driven away from the scene shortly after – through a red traffic light.

In a press conference, Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, emphasized that the priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and then to remove ICE from the scene because they were “making a difficult situation more problematic”.

He also noted that the video footage does not appear to show that a vehicle was being weaponized against the ICE officer.

Frey even issued an emphatic statement to ICE directly: “I do have a message for our community for our city and I do have a message for ICE. To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety and you are doing exactly the opposite.

“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Longterm Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized and now, somebody is dead.

Contining to address ICE, Frey said: “That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury, is not done.”

The mayor also said the DHS was “trying to spin this as an action of self defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

Minneapolis chief of police, Brian O’Hara, told the press conference: “This woman was in her car and it appears then blocking the street because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening not just in Minneapolis but around the country.”

He said the victim was “a middle-aged white woman”, and that there was nothing to suggest she was the target of any law enforcement investigation or activity. Earlier, Frey said she was 37 years old.

The woman was no longer in the car when he arrived on the scene, O’Hara said, adding that “a spouse” had since arrived at the hospital. The police chief said the FBI would conduct a joint investigation with the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension.

Echoing Frey, Tim Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor, posted on X that he had “seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”

Omar also rejected claims made by DHS on X in a Wednesday afternoon post: “You’re lying. There was no attempt to run the officer over and no ICE agents appear to be hurt. Get out of our city.”

Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota’s Democratic lieutenant governor, issued a statement saying: “ICE has committed an unspeakable act of violence today.

“These masked agents are out of control and creating real chaos in our state. ICE must leave Minnesota immediately – before more people are hurt. In the face of their violence, let us remain peaceful, calm, and united. Minnesotans will not allow Trump and his thugs to turn our communities into war zones.”

Large numbers of protesters gathered close to the scene in the south of the city shortly after the shooting, with law enforcement officers firing chemical irritants in an attempt to disperse them.

In various video footage, bystanders can been seen and heard blowing whistles and taunting the federal agents, telling them to go home. A woman said she spoke to an eyewitness who told her the person shot was a woman who “took off” from federal agents.

“They shot her through the windshield. They shot her in the face,” the woman said.

Jon Collins, a reporter for MPR News, posted to Bluesky that protesters stopped ICE agents after the shooting and were pepper sprayed.

“ICE teargassed a lot of people as they drove down the alley. People were stuck in alley and hit hard. Some people are still getting medical treatment,” he wrote.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday it had launched an extraordinary immigration enforcement operation, with 2,000 agents and officers expected in the Minneapolis and St Paul area for a crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session Tuesday night for about 100 people who are willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9dc2e3567ce6166845974d69d43e6757e7e825/584_0_2916_2333/master/2916.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=153bbc629ee1befde1ffcc472a0c98d5",N,,2026-01-07 15:57:58.602676

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed the death on X and in a statement to Sahan Journal about 11:45 a.m.

Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference later in the day that the woman was 37, and noted that ICE had claimed self-defense in shooting her.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everyone directly. That is [expletive],” said Frey, who demanded that ICE leave Minnesota.

Witness Caitlin Callenson shared a video with Sahan Journal that appears to show federal agents walking up to the door of a maroon SUV stopped in the middle of the street. In the video, a federal officer pulls on the SUV’s door handle, and when the driver tries to pull away from the agents, a second federal officer fires shots into the vehicle. The vehicle moves forward briefly and crashes into a curb and another vehicle.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the news conference that the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the shooting.

The city of Minneapolis issued a statement at 10:26 a.m. Wednesday asking residents to stay away from the scene of the shooting at E. 34th Street and Portland Avenue in south Minneapolis. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino was present at the scene.

Gov. Tim Walz said on social media that his public safety team was “working to gather information on an ICE related shooting this morning” and asked the public to remain calm. Sen. Tina Smith said on social media that the shooting victim was a U.S. citizen. “ICE should leave now for everyone’s safety,” she wrote.

Eyewitness accounts

Tyrice Jones told Sahan Journal he heard gunshots followed by a crash outside his building at 34th street and Portland Avenue Wednesday morning.

Jones came outside and saw a woman in a maroon SUV bleeding from what he believed was a gunshot wound.

Tyrice Jones told Sahan Journal he heard gunshots followed by a crash outside his building at 34th street and Portland Avenue Wednesday morning.

Jones came outside and saw a woman in a maroon SUV bleeding from what he believed was a gunshot wound.

“They weren’t trying to do [expletive] for her. Nothing,” Jones said. “She was just there, lifeless.”

There were ICE agents around the car, Jones said, adding that a woman who appeared to know the victim was crying in front of an apartment building asking for a doctor.

Alex Weekes told Sahan Journal he woke up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard a car honking outside his house. Weekes looked out his window and saw a red SUV parked in the street blocking other vehicles from moving along the roadway. He said he saw federal agents step out of their vehicle and approach the SUV, and then heard gunshots.

“The [person] in the SUV tried driving away from them when they did that,” he said of the agents approaching the SUV. “There was one (federal agent) near the front corner of the car, and they shot [the driver] three times.

“I was just thinking, ‘Damn, did ICE just really shoot a [expletive] guy outside my house?’ I mean you never think that’s gonna happen literally across the street.

Trevor Heitkamp lives a block away from the from the scene and said he witnessed the shooting. He left his house for a cigarette shortly before 9:45 a.m., heard a commotion, walked down the street and started recording.

The woman appeared to be trying to turn her vehicle around, Heitkamp told Sahan Journal. He said she was going no more than 5 miles an hour and was receiving direction from multiple federal agents. Heitkamp heard several people shout, “No,” and then heard multiple gun shots.

The woman’s car rolled forward and crashed, and less than a minute later a passenger exited covered in blood, he said. The two people in the car appeared to be white women, he said.

A man who also witnessed the shooting shouted at ICE that he was a doctor and asked to perform first-aid, Heitkamp said.

“The ICE agents told him to back up and stay on the sidewalk,” Heitkamp said.

He heard ICE agents call out, “No pulse.” About two minutes later, EMS crews arrived, administered CPR and carried the victim to an ambulance.

“It didn’t need to happen,” Heitkamp said. “And I don’t think the government has the right to kill its citizens for inconveniencing them.”

Liliana Zaragoza, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota was in the area at the time of the incident and shared her account with Sahan Journal: First responders were seen performing CPR on a person on the sidewalk. The person was undressed, and had blood in their hair and face. Minneapolis police officials were present at the scene who told Zaragoza it was a “crime scene.”

“That person looked lifeless from the moment I saw them,” Zaragoza said.

Sahan photojournalist Aaron Nesheim was at the scene as events unfolded. He reported seeing a car that had crashed, with a lone woman in the driver’s seat. The airbag was deployed and covered in blood.

Twenty to 30 ICE agents were on the scene around 9:50 a.m., and a crowd had started to gather.

The woman was slumped over the airbag. Minneapolis firefighters pulled her out of the car and moved her down the street to 34th Street and Portland Avenue, where they began performing CPR, according to Nesheim.

The crowd continued to grow as the woman was taken to the hospital. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara arrived and briefly spoke to Bovino.

Minneapolis police eventually brought in an armed tactical vehicle, apparently to help with crowd control.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office posted on social media it was not involved in the shooting, but dispatched deputies to the scene to assist other law enforcement as needed.

More than 100 protesters had gathered on Portland Avenue and E. 33rd Street by 10:30 a.m., and about 40 unmarked SUVs, and Hennepin County Sheriff’s and Minneapolis Police vehicles were parked in a wide perimeter around the scene, blocking off the area with yellow tape.

Protesters shouted at officers, blew whistles and banged on drums throughout the morning and early afternoon.

Most ICE and Border Patrol agents left the scene at around 11 a.m. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) began collecting evidence from the victim’s Honda Pilot, which crashed into a lightpole and a parked car.

About 11 a.m., officers in camouflage sprayed a green gas on protesters, and began using pepper spray on the crowd.

Protesters remained at the scene as of 2 p.m. as officers took down yellow police tape and other barricades. A group of about 400 protesters began marching from the scene toward downtown Minneapolis shortly before 3 p.m.

Shooting comes on heels of increased enforcement

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarity issued a written statement saying her office has been in touch with the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, Walz and law enforcement leaders throughout the day, and is “pushing hard for a local investigation, which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”

Venus de Mars, a local musician who lives on the block, witnessed paramedics performing CPR on the shooting victim in a snowbank. De Mars said the victim appeared to be a white woman, who was removed from the scene in an ambulance.

“They didn’t rush her away, they didn’t have sirens or anything,” de Mars said. “I’m very worried that she didn’t make it.”

City Council Member Robin Wonsley, who represents a different area of south Minneapolis, posted on social media that she was on the scene with other council members.

“Residents witnessed federal agents shoot an observer. The resident was transported to a hospital,” she wrote. “I will keep you updated as information comes out.”

The shooting comes on the heels of a progressive escalation of federal action and staffing in Minnesota, and a visit Tuesday from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. An additional 2,000 ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents were reportedly deployed to Minnesota this week, according to CBS News. Sahan Journal has not been able to verify the number.

Increased immigration crackdowns will likely continue across the country, boosted by ICE’s increased budget and staffing. There are 12,000 new ICE agents in 2026, the agency announced Monday, more than doubling its personnel from the start of 2025.

More than 150 people in Minnesota were arrested by immigration agents Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a news release.

The deployment is swelling the ranks of ICE in Minnesota, which began an effort dubbed Operation Metro Surge in December. The most recent surge in agents is expected to last 30 days and include U.S. Border Patrol agents, CBS reported.

In a social media post earlier in the day, Frey said: “The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city. We are demanding ICE leave the city and state immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”

“An ICE officer, fearing for ​his ‌life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and ‌the safety of ‌the public, ⁠fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin wrote in a post ‌on X.

Mayor Jacob Frey alleged the officer “recklessly” shot her, adding immigration agents are “causing chaos in our city”.

“They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets and in this case, quite literally killing people,” Frey said at a news conference.

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bulls**t,” the mayor said.

Dramatic escalation

A dark-coloured SUV with a bullet hole through its windshield and blood splattered ‌across the headrest was seen rammed into a pole on the snowy street where the shooting took place.

Venus de Mars, 65, a resident who lives near the site of the shooting, described seeing paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car. Shortly ‌after, they loaded her into an ambulance that drove away without its sirens on.

“There’s been lots of ICE activity, but nothing like this,” de Mars said. “I’m so angry. I’m so angry ‍, and I feel helpless.”

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major US cities under the Trump administration.

The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul have been on edge since DHS announced on Tuesday it launched the operation with 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

The shooting drew protesters into the streets near the scene, some of whom were ⁠met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical munitions at the demonstrators.

A large throng of protesters gathered and vented their anger at the local and federal officers there. “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota!”, they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

The area where the shooting occurred is a modest neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and 1.6km (one mile) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Al Jazeera’s John Hendren reported Minnesota Public Radio quoted a witness saying, “ICE agents were telling the driver, a woman, to get out of here. She was trying to turn around, and the ICE agent was in front of the car, and he pulled out a gun.”

The witness said “he [an agent] reached across the hood of the car and shot her in the face, like three or four times”. The woman’s vehicle then accelerated and travelled about 30 metres (100 feet) before crashing into a utility pole.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695eab31c456-1767811889.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-07 14:58:40.433542

The person is dead, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.

Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approach a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. The driver then slowly backs up and appears to be leaving, when another officer fires three shots. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.

The witness who took the video, Caitlin Callenson, said she was on a walk when she saw an ICE vehicle stuck in the snow. As more ICE vehicles arrived, bystanders blew whistles in protest, and the driver of the SUV tried to block the ICE vehicles.

Callenson said she did not see ICE agents attempting to detain anyone leading up to or after the shooting.

After the shots were fired, the driver was “then was completely slumped over in the vehicle,” said Emily Heller, another witness. Federal agents wouldn’t allow a man who said he is a physician to examine the driver, Heller said. Emergency medical technicians arrived 15 minutes later, she said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Secretary Dept. of Homeland Security, writing on X, gave a different version of what happened: “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

Dozens of federal agents from ICE and the FBI, as well as Minneapolis police officers and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene

As some federal officers attempted to leave, protestors blocked their vehicle. The officers fired a noxious gas at close range, causing distress and vomiting for many demonstrators and journalists.

Protests are ongoing.

Protesters hurled insults at Minneapolis Police officers, who are not supposed to assist with immigration enforcement, but were on the scene Wednesday morning.

City Council members including Robin Wonsley and Jamal Osman addressed the crowd, saying the area was an active crime scene, and that MPD was present to investigate.

“We are trying to get MPD the f*ck out of here. That is the best way they can be helpful right now,” Wonsley told the demonstrators.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty issued a statement soon after the shooting saying she is “pushing hard for a local investigation which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”

U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a St. Paul Democrat, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who filmed herself observing ICE actions in Minneapolis on Tuesday, to immediately stop the ICE operation “to restore order and prevent further injuries.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Minnesota-ICE.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:58:48.725901

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis motorist on Wednesday during the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials claimed was an act of self-defense but that the city's mayor describged as ""reckless"" and unnecessary.

Watch a briefing by state and local authorities in the video player above.

The shooting happened in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the oldest immigrant markets in the area and a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, during a visit to Texas, described the incident as an ""act of domestic terrorism"" carried out against ICE officers by a woman who ""attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.""

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterization and the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers as part of the immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

""They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,"" Frey said, calling on the federal agents to leave the city. ""They're ripping families apart. They're sowing chaos on our streets and in this case quite literally killing people.""

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,"" the mayor said.

The shooting marks a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major American cities under the Trump administration. It's at least the fifth person killed in a handful of states since 2024.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced Tuesday that it had launched the operation, with more than 2,000 agents and officers expected to participate in the crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, where they vented their anger at the local and federal officers who were there, including Gregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In a scene that hearkened back to the Los Angeles and Chicago crackdowns, bystanders heckled the officers and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" and ""ICE out of Minnesota!"" they loudly chanted from behind the police tape.

During her Texas visit, Noem confirmed that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities and already made ""hundreds and hundreds"" of arrests.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighborhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilize in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have set up very active online networks, scanned license plates for possible federal vehicles and bought whistles and other noise-making devices to alert neighborhoods of any enforcement presence.

On Tuesday night, the Immigration Defense Network, a coalition of groups serving immigrants in Minnesota, held a training session for about 100 people who were willing to hit the streets to monitor the federal enforcement operation.

""I feel like I'm an ordinary person, and I have the ability do something so I need to do it,"" Mary Moran told KMSP-TV.

EXCLUSIVE: Maryland’s top election officials are facing renewed scrutiny from Congressional Republicans after the state's administrator of elections declined to provide definitive answers concerning the state’s voter rolls after it was discovered an illegal immigrant serving as a superintendent of a massive school system in Iowa was allegedly fraudulently registered to vote in Maryland, Fox News Digital learned.

""Maryland's chief elections official failed to provide complete answers, leaving serious concerns unresolved — chiefly whether Ian Roberts ever received a live ballot and whether the State has implemented new protocols to verify citizenship after this bombshell report,"" Republican Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil exclusively told Fox News Digital Wednesday.

""This case underscores the urgent need for stronger citizenship verification requirements when registering to vote — which was reaffirmed by President Trump just yesterday in his meeting with House lawmakers,"" he continued. ""The Committee's investigation will continue.""

Steil is the chair of the House Committee on House Administration. He and Vice Chair Laurel Lee, R-Fla., sent a letter to Maryland State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis in December 2025, demanding answers regarding illegal immigrant Ian Andre Roberts' registration to vote in the state despite not holding U.S. citizenship. Roberts is originally from Guyana with ties to the U.S. going back to the 1990s.

TRUMP DOJ DEMANDS MINNESOTA VOTING RECORDS OVER SAME-DAY REGISTRATION 'VOUCHING' CONCERNS

The House Administration Committee oversees House operations and oversight and also is charged with considering proposals to amend federal election law.

The committee pressed for answers to questions such as: ""Is Roberts still a registered voter in Maryland?;"" ""Has Mr. Roberts ever voted in Maryland? If yes, what election(s) did he participate in?;"" ""Was Mr. Roberts ever mailed an absentee ballot? If yes, for which election(s)?"" and ""How does the State Board of Elections fulfill their obligations under 52 U.S.C. §20507 to conduct a general program to remove ineligible voters from the rolls?""

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained DeMarinis' response letter to the House Committee on House Administration, which defended the state’s voter registration system but stopped short of confirming whether Roberts, an illegal immigrant later arrested by ICE, was ever mailed an absentee ballot or remains registered to vote.

MINNESOTA LETS VOTERS 'VOUCH' FOR UP TO 8 OTHERS AS FRAUD SCANDALS FUEL CALLS FOR FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

""While no voter should be on the Maryland voter rolls if they are not a citizen of the United States, being on the voter rolls does not equate to having voted in an election. This is an important distinction as we investigate potential illegalities and potential prosecution,"" DeMarinis wrote in the response letter dated Monday.

The Maryland State Administrator of Elections did acknowledge the House Administration Committee's questions specifically as they relate to Roberts but could not offer definitive information.

DEM STATE ELECTION BOARD UNDER FIRE AFTER ICE-ARRESTED SUPERINTENDENT SURFACES ON VOTER ROLLS

""Regarding the Committee’s questions concerning Ian Andre Roberts, SBE does not and cannot confirm that the identity of a voter matches that of another voter record in another state, based merely on the public facing information available,"" he wrote. ""Even in other states, as in Maryland, public information on those voter lookups is limited in order to protect personal identifying information (PII) from disclosure. Public voter lookup tools are not designed to perform voter list maintenance procedures. Therefore, SBE will not confirm whether the individual in question is or is not or was or was not a registered voter in Maryland.""

He added that public voting history in Maryland did not yield results that ""any individual with the name Ian Andre Roberts in Maryland"" had a voting history in the blue state.

Maryland Republican Delegate Matt Morgan, chairman of the Maryland Freedom Caucus, told Fox Digital Wednesday that, ""The Maryland State Board of Elections is dropping the ball.""

""By failing to comply with a basic data request, they are fueling suspicion,"" he said. ""Their primary job is to prove our elections are secure and restricted to citizens, yet they’ve chosen secrecy over transparency. If there's nothing to conceal, why withhold the data? It’s time for the SBE to stop dodging questions and start providing answers.""

Roberts' voter registration documents have faced intense scrutiny from conservatives, including when a Maryland county board of elections released redacted versions of the files in November that blacked out how Roberts answered the citizenship question.

DeMarinis said the redactions of ""the original production of the voter record was made with redactions applying to general requests for information under Maryland’s Public information Act, rather than requests specifically for a voter record.""

""Once realized, a corrected record was produced. The information redacted was redacted pursuant to State and federal laws that permit withholding of certain voter information. Federal law requires the redaction of source of voter registration,"" he said, referring to an updated release of the documents that showed Roberts reported he was a U.S. citizen on his voter application.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STRIKES DEAL WITH OHIO TO CLEAN UP STATE VOTER ROLLS USING FEDERAL DATABASE

Roberts served as superintendent of the Des Moines school district, the largest school district in Iowa, at the time of his arrest in October. The state revoked Roberts' education license following his arrest, and he is no longer serving as the district's top leader.

He initially attempted to flee law enforcement officers, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and was found to be in possession of $3,000 in cash, a Glock 9 mm pistol and a hunting knife at the time of his arrest.

The charges are his latest in a lengthy rap sheet that goes back to 1996, federal officials previously said.

""In the end, it is important to remember as our guiding principle that as the Maryland Declaration of Rights states, ‘the right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best security of liberty and the foundation of all free Government; . . . and every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage,’"" DeMarinis concluded his letter.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

ICE LAUNCHES ‘LARGEST IMMIGRATION OPERATION EVER’ IN MINNEAPOLIS, ACTING DIRECTOR SAYS

Minneapolis’ official X account posted earlier that it was aware of a shooting involving federal law enforcement near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue and warned the public to ""avoid this area.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News the incident was a ""direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats.""

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics.
McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make full recoveries.
Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.
The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday after a group of people began blocking agents during an immigration-related operation, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE agents were conducting targeted operations in the city when a woman, 37, allegedly ""weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city in a press conference held in the hours after the shooting.

“What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,"" he said. ""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.""

Frey added that there was little he could say to make the current situation better but he had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.

""To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" the mayor said. ""We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents’ vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman ""attacked them.""

""It was an act of domestic terrorism,"" she said.

The agent fired what McLaughlin said were ""defensive shots"" and killed the woman.

""He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,"" she said.

Frey said it did not appear from video of the incident that the vehicle was being weaponized against the agent.

President Donald Trump has unleashed immigration agents in cities across America, who have been employing increasingly aggressive tactics. The efforts have ramped up tensions with local officials and communities that are increasingly protesting the efforts in some cities.

Video footage from NBC affiliate KARE 11 of Minneapolis showed a burgundy SUV with what appears to be a bullet hole in the windshield. The vehicle had crashed into a light pole. It’s not clear to whom the SUV belongs or from where the bullet was shot.

Brandon Hewitt, who is new to the neighborhood, said he was getting up around 8:30 a.m. when he heard three gunshots. He then looked outside and said he saw that a vehicle had crashed.

""I’m pretty right-leaning, but seeing this, this is not what you need to do,"" he told KARE. ""It’s not how to do it. It’s not how we’re supposed to do things around here in America.""

Residents and locals gathered in the street after the shooting, chanting and throwing snowballs in the direction of federal agents, KARE reported. Law enforcement deployed pepper spray and tear gas.

McLaughlin said the ICE officers injured during the incident are expected to make full recoveries. She did not detail what type of injuries the agents sustained.

Since arriving in Minneapolis in early December, ICE officers and agents have arrested roughly 1,400 people, McLaughlin previously said.

That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there on Wednesday.

DHS, this week, sent hundreds of more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging “the largest DHS operation ever” in Minnesota.

The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.

Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.

The rush of more enforcement follows the posting of a video by a conservative content creator the day after Christmas that alleged Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis were defrauding American taxpayers by taking federal grant money and not providing any services to children.

The FBI surged investigators in the city to look into the allegations soon after the video was posted, HSI has been door-knocking on Somali businesses since last week and the state of Minnesota concluded from its on-site checks of 10 Somali day care centers targeted in the video that they were operating normally, with children at every site except one, which was not yet open to investigators when they arrived to investigate.

Minneapolis’ Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who has said his department does not enforce immigration laws, has expressed concern that the DHS immigration dragnet may lead to political unrest, KARE 11 reported.

Many Minnesota residents of Somali descent, including those who are American citizens, have been staying indoors or have reduced activity outside, fearful of being snagged in the stepped-up enforcement now in its second month.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/250107-ice-minnesota-vl-1150a-a7f6dc.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 13:59:10.290513

But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty.
People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby.
I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead.
People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.","As the Trump administration expands immigration police surges across the country, what has stood out has been the acts of resistance. Communities and organizations have put together rapid response hotlines, protested outside hotels sheltering federal agents, and carried whistles to warn their neighbors when immigration police are nearby. That resistance has kept me alive and has been so necessary.

But living in Little Village, a neighborhood in Chicago that was targeted by “Operation Midway Blitz” in the fall, I’ve also seen and experienced the psychological toll of these operations, both on the communities targeted and those of us organizing to defend them.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino’s surge of immigration police into Chicago has made national headlines for its cruelty and aggression. But what is important to understand about Border Patrol entering a neighborhood is the uncertainty. You never know when agents will show up or when they will decide to turn their presence into a public show of force. On some days, the neighborhood felt almost normal. On others, everything would shut down without warning.

First would come the whistles. People organized, warning the community that immigration agents were nearby. Within minutes, streets that were usually crowded would empty. Sidewalks where street vendors normally worked would be completely bare. Businesses closed early. People disappeared indoors. I remember sitting at my desk and suddenly hearing the Border Patrol helicopters circling overhead. I didn’t need to see it to wonder which one of my neighbors they had taken. My stomach still drops at the sound of any helicopter blades.

So, many people decided to stay home. Parents stopped going to work. Children missed school. Entire communities went missing. They survived by asking friends or neighbors to pick up medicine, buy groceries, or take children to school when they felt it was too risky to leave their homes. Organizations of all kinds have stepped up to deliver food and supplies directly to people’s homes. Individuals volunteered to give rides, buy groceries, collect donations, walk dogs.

During the recent immigration surge in New Orleans, I heard from friends who isolated themselves weeks before agents ever arrived. They had seen the violence in Chicago and began to take safety measures as soon as the news broke of “Operation Swamp Sweep,” the immigration police raid targeting Louisiana.

The Trump administration’s assault on us is not solely about increasing deportations. It is about manufacturing fear: the fear that keeps parents inside, students out of school, workers in panic, and entire neighborhoods from living with dignity. And make no mistake: this fear is intentional. It is meant to make us feel so unwanted that we make ourselves disappear.

These psychological operations are layered and intentional. Helicopters circle above Chicago as Border Patrol turns enforcement into spectacle. During these operations, teachers are abducted, children are tear-gassed, homes are invaded. People are threatened with criminalization for resisting or even filming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol. All of this is reinforced by Department of Homeland Security ads on Univision and Telemundo, the largest Spanish-language broadcasters, threatening to “hunt” immigrants, urging undocumented people to self-deport, and spreading fear inside homes already targeted by Donald Trump’s policies.

As an organizer I cut my teeth doing civil disobedience and rapid response against deportations more than 20 years ago. I am not usually the first person to call for organizing mutual aid or mental health support. But what I’ve seen and experienced during these months of immigration surges has left me worried. Of course we have to organize and build rapid response networks, and make sure that people know to stay inside and not open the door. But we must also build the infrastructure that allows people to make those choices without losing access to food, income, care, or community.

I don’t know what the next phase of this administration will look like. I don’t know where the next surge will land, what new tactic will be tested, or whose neighborhood will be turned into the next spectacle of violence. What I do know is that this is not random, and that it will continue to happen. And because of that, the answer cannot be isolation. It has to be each other. We have to keep organizing, building networks that meet material needs and protect people’s dignity, creating systems of care that make survival possible even when staying home becomes the safest choice.

The damage being done to our communities is intentional, but so is our response. We will continue to organize because that is how we refuse to disappear.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2237593856-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:13:13.264617

""The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,"" the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents' vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: ""You will be held accountable for your crimes.""

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as ""a war that's being waged against Minnesota.""

""You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,"" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using ""questionable methods"" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was ""unlike any other day we've experienced.""

""It's incredibly distressing,"" Coleman said. ""What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.""

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

""We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,"" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for ""not meeting our standards and values"" when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.","The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Jan. 5 agreed to expedite an appeal of a court loss by U.S. business and research groups that are challenging President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, had argued that a speedy review was needed in order to preserve employers’ rights ahead of the once-annual H-1B visa lottery scheduled to begin in March. The Trump administration did not oppose the quicker timeline, and the court agreed to a plan that will allow oral arguments to proceed in February.

The Chamber of Commerce and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The annual process is the only opportunity for most U.S. employers that wish to hire skilled workers through the H-1B program to apply for the visas, according to the Chamber’s court filings.

“Those employers’ ability to participate in the H-1B program this year therefore hinges on the outcome of this appeal; without relief by March, it will be too late,” the Chamber said in court papers filed on Jan. 2.

The Chamber is appealing a Dec. 24 decision by a U.S. District Court judge, who concluded that the new fee fell within the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration.

Before Trump imposed the new $100,000 fee in September, H-1B visas had typically come with about $2,000 to $5,000 in fees depending on various factors.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with training in specialty fields. Technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H1-B visas. The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has separately issued a new regulation that replaces the random selection of the lottery with a new allotment system that prioritizes visas for higher-skilled and higher-paid foreign workers. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 27.

The Trump administration has said that the H1-B program has been abused by U.S. employers who seek to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.

“We have a government of the boss, by the boss, and for the boss, it’s all for him, and that hurts people, and it’s threatening to our democracy, threatening to the rule of law,” he added.

Conway used the fifth anniversary of the Capitol insurrection to launch a bid for Congress in New York. He’s running for the seat now held by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is retiring.

“The largest DHS operation ever is happening right now in Minnesota,” the department said in a post on X, dramatically expanding the federal law enforcement footprint in the state amid heightened political and community tensions.

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Minnesota governor blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents’ reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

Human Rights Watch said it could not independently confirm that explanation.
Human Rights Watch urged the government to end arbitrary arrests, investigate allegations of abuse, disclose the whereabouts of missing detainees and allow independent monitors access to military barracks.
It also called on international partners to condition support for South Sudan’s security forces on respect for human rights.
“Instead of addressing crime, security forces have used this campaign to commit serious abuses against marginalized youth,” Pur said.","South Sudanese security forces have carried out sweeping arbitrary arrests of boys, young men and women in the capital, Juba, since late June 2025, subjecting detainees to torture, extortion and forced conscription, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Wednesday.

The rights group said the arrests were conducted under the pretext of a crackdown on criminal gangs following reports of rising youth violence in the city. In at least one raid, police officers beat and raped women in custody, the organization said.

“Security forces have arbitrarily detained, extorted and forcibly conscripted dozens of boys and young men, and raped young women,” said Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. She called on authorities to release those unlawfully detained and hold perpetrators accountable.

Human Rights Watch said it conducted remote interviews between Aug. 7 and Nov. 23 with 37 people, including victims and relatives, as well as civil society activists and United Nations child protection experts. Three of those interviewed were children.

The group said it wrote to police and military spokespersons on Dec. 10 seeking comment on its findings but received no response.

Youth violence and gang activity have increased in South Sudan over the past decade, fueled by poverty, unemployment, displacement and prolonged conflict. In mid-June 2025, a video circulated on social media showing the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl in Juba by alleged gang members, prompting public outrage.

Soon afterward, the National Police Service, the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces and the National Security Service launched joint operations across residential neighborhoods of the capital. While authorities initially described the campaign as a seven-day operation starting in early July, witnesses told Human Rights Watch that arrests continued through the end of 2025.

By early July, authorities said at least 600 suspected gang members had been arrested. In October, police announced the arrest of 32 alleged criminals and the seizure of weapons, saying criminal proceedings would follow. Human Rights Watch said it could not verify any prosecutions related to gang activity beyond the gang rape case, in which 13 suspects were arrested and seven charged.

According to the report, boys and young men were often targeted while walking or gathering in groups. Detainees described beatings in police stations and military facilities, overcrowded detention conditions, and a lack of food and water.

Several former detainees said they were released only after relatives paid money or provided goods to security personnel. Others said they were transferred to military camps in Upper Nile state, where fighting has intensified since early 2025. Human Rights Watch said some detainees were forced into combat roles, while others were compelled to perform labor for soldiers.

At least four families told the group that relatives detained by security forces remain missing, with authorities refusing to disclose their whereabouts.

Police authorities denied allegations of forced conscription in comments to local media in August, saying the operation targeted criminals and that some detainees were moved outside Juba due to overcrowding. Human Rights Watch said it could not independently confirm that explanation.

South Sudanese law and international treaties ratified by the country prohibit arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence and the recruitment of children by armed forces. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that detention of minors should be used only as a last resort.

Human Rights Watch urged the government to end arbitrary arrests, investigate allegations of abuse, disclose the whereabouts of missing detainees and allow independent monitors access to military barracks.

Mr. Rubio made his remarks in a briefing on Monday with lawmakers from the main armed services and foreign policy committees in both chambers of Congress. The same day, Mr. Trump told aides to deliver an updated plan.

The congressional briefing was focused on Venezuela, but lawmakers raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s intentions on Greenland given aggressive remarks this week by the American president and a top aide, Stephen Miller, two officials said.

Mr. Rubio did not go into detail on what he meant by buying Greenland. Mr. Trump spent decades in New York as a real estate developer, and one of his top diplomatic envoys, Steve Witkoff, comes from the same background. Mr. Trump has coveted Greenland since his first term.

Greenland is a sparsely populated, autonomous territory that falls under the sovereign boundaries of Denmark, a member of NATO. Denmark established colonial control over Greenland in the 18th century, and allowed it to become autonomous in the 20th century.

On Tuesday, leaders of six NATO nations joined with Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, to issue a remarkable joint statement pushing back against Mr. Trump’s assertions that the United States should take over Greenland. The nations that aligned with Denmark were Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland, all of which are close allies of the United States.

“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” they said. “These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”

“Greenland belongs to its people,” they added. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had not ruled out a U.S. invasion of Greenland.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” she said in a statement. “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief’s disposal.”

Some lawmakers voiced concern about Mr. Trump’s stated plans. On Tuesday evening, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, issued a joint statement saying the U.S. government must respect its allies.

“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” said the senators, who lead the Senate NATO Observer Group.

“Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our alliance exists to defend,” they added.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that “Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”

Those two nations are active powers in the Arctic Circle, but Greenland is not surrounded by their ships. In fact, it is the United States that has a military base in Greenland. Vice President JD Vance visited the base with his wife, Usha, last year.

Mr. Trump has also focused on Greenland because of its potential wealth of critical minerals.

The second Trump administration’s National Security Strategy says dominance of the Western Hemisphere is a top priority. That has been brought into sharp focus with Mr. Trump’s monthslong military pressure campaign against Venezuela and the seizure on Saturday by U.S. troops of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, during a deadly attack. And Mr. Trump said early last year that he planned to acquire Canada.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06dc-greenland-cvmf/06dc-greenland-cvmf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:29.565526

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, had argued that a speedy review was needed in order to preserve employers’ rights ahead of the once-annual H-1B visa lottery scheduled to begin in March. The Trump administration did not oppose the quicker timeline, and the court agreed to a plan that will allow oral arguments to proceed in February.

The Chamber of Commerce and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The annual process is the only opportunity for most U.S. employers that wish to hire skilled workers through the H-1B program to apply for the visas, according to the Chamber’s court filings.

“Those employers’ ability to participate in the H-1B program this year therefore hinges on the outcome of this appeal; without relief by March, it will be too late,” the Chamber said in court papers filed on Jan. 2.

The Chamber is appealing a Dec. 24 decision by a U.S. District Court judge, who concluded that the new fee fell within the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration.

Before Trump imposed the new $100,000 fee in September, H-1B visas had typically come with about $2,000 to $5,000 in fees depending on various factors.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with training in specialty fields. Technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H1-B visas. The program offers 65,000 visas annually, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, approved for three to six years.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has separately issued a new regulation that replaces the random selection of the lottery with a new allotment system that prioritizes visas for higher-skilled and higher-paid foreign workers. The rule is scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 27.

The Trump administration has said that the H1-B program has been abused by U.S. employers who seek to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.

The Chamber said in its lawsuit that the new fee would force businesses that rely on the H-1B program to choose between dramatically increasing their labor costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers.

A group of Democratic-led U.S. states and a coalition of employers, nonprofits and religious organizations have also filed lawsuits challenging the fee.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2026/01/FLAG-VISA-FORM.webp,N,,2026-01-07 10:59:13.521301

DHS claimed the cancellation was part of a “coordinated campaign” orchestrated by Hilton Hotels in Minneapolis to “undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.” On Tuesday, additional online posts confirmed the hotel’s refusal to house immigration agents, leading Hilton Hotels to cut ties with the hotel.

“[W]e are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems,” an X post from Hilton read. “Hilton is—and always has been—a welcoming place for all. We are also engaging with all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again.”

Private businesses generally have discretion to refuse service to individuals without justification. However, federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin. States can add to these protections. The Minnesota Human Rights Act additionally prohibits discrimination solely based on “creed… disability… marital status, sexual orientation, sex, or gender identity.” Neither federal nor state law expressly carve out protections based on federal employment status.

Human rights concerns

What they're saying:

Khanna posted photos of the exterior of the privately run detention facility east of Bakersfield on social media. He said his Tuesday visit was prompted by the detention of a constituent from Sunnyvale whom he said was beaten and was later deported.

He said he was escorted through the center, which he described as ""cold"" and ""stark,"" by six staff members, including the warden.

According to Khanna, several inmates told him they did not know why they were being held. He said he was most alarmed by what he described as an apparent lack of medical care at the facility.

""I am deeply shaken by my visit,"" Khanna said in videos on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, where he wrote a lengthy description of his visit.

He decribed meeting with 47 detainees, many of whom were in tears.

Some told him, ""We are human beings. We should not be treated like animals or murderers.""

Khanna said some reported that they had rocks in the food, they didn't get fruit for weeks, they couldn't see their family members face-to-face, but could only speak to them on phones behind glass.

He said the detainees came from Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, India, Mexico, Nepal, Venezuela, and others. Most told Khanna they were never told why they were detained.

""I am sounding the alarm,"" Khanna said, adding that he wants Congressional oversight over ICE facilities.

ICE did not immediately respond for comment.

Lawsuit filed

Big picture view:

In November, several ICE detainees, including Gomez Ruiz, sued ICE in US District Court in Northern California, alleging the California City center is polluted with sewage, provides inadequate medical care and is denying people access to food and lawyers.

The California City Immigration Processing Center is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield.

It used to operate as a state prison managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ICE contracted with the for-profit company CoreCivic to re-open the prison as an immigration detention center in 2025.

With 2,560 beds, the facility is the largest immigration detention center in California.

When the lawsuit was filed, more than 800 people were detained in the facility. On Khanna's visit this week, he said he was told that 1,428 detainees were there, including 215 women.

CoreCivic projects the center will reach full capacity by early 2026.

The lawsuit was filed by the Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.",https://images.foxtv.com/static-media.fox.com/fmcv3/prod/fts/xys8xktu6mjjt5eh/1280/720/2q8g8han5e4dveta.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-07 10:58:53.356146

-General Ferdinand Foch

History is replete with times when an army in fighting retreat draws a line, digs in, and then counterattacks. The Russians in WW2 took world-historic losses, before turning the tide with a massive counteroffensive around Stalingrad. The French and British forces in the early days of WW1 were pushed back across the frontier. The Germans were within sight of Paris. But they became stretched out over the course of the advance. When a gap opened in their lines, the exhausted, demoralised allied troops had to rally, get into an entirely different mindset, and go on the attack.

Likewise with political debates, a side that has had the worst of it can decide to get off the defensive.

Across the world, free societies are under assault from a resurgent fascism. Across the world, fears about immigration have been one of the main—arguably the main—weapon used. And across the world, there has been a timidity on the part of progressives about countering these arguments. There is a pervasive pessimism that this is a debate we can win. That the public at large will ever side with a pro-immigration position.

To some degree this is understandable, but it is not wise. We have no choice but to fight—the closed-border, mass-deportation agenda of the modern right will destroy nations if we let it. And fascists will never stop capitalizing on nativist narratives as long as they are allowed to stand.

We are locked into a battle we did not seek and our timidity is keeping us on the defensive. It isn’t working. Our pessimism is self-fulfilling. In any contact sport, you get hurt more by flinching from the tackle than you do from committing to it. No one ever won a fist fight they were convinced they'd lose. In politics, it is not enough to contest conclusions and debate details. You must attack premises—trash and tarnish the foundations of your opponent's case. And you must put forward a positive, values-driven vision of your own.

The right has any number of advantages on immigration. And majority public opinion is often with them. But this is by no means inevitable. They are also overextended—committed to increasingly deranged visions, with the horrific consequences of their worldview more and more visible every day. It’s time to shake off our timidity, take a deep breath, and go on the offensive.

I have a hunch—no more, but no less—that most politically active progressives are ready for this. I think if a critical mass of us decided to take the fight to the enemy, many more would quickly join. And I think we would find the forces arrayed against us much weaker than we initially supposed.

After all, ‘turning points’ in war are as much psychological as they are strategic. A matter of changing the attitude and orientation of the army. First and foremost, we must understand what we are fighting for, and believe that victory is possible. Tactics will follow the will to fight, not the other way around.

Are you sure we have to fight?

That’s the question center-left parties have been asking. Their response has generally been to try and avoid talking about it. And, where that fails, to give ground, to try and find a compromise with the right, and show nativist voters that their “reasonable concerns” are being “taken seriously”. Nowhere has this worked. Barack Obama sought a deal with Republicans in which increased border security and immigration enforcement would be traded for reforms and protection for some of the existing undocumented population. He ramped up deportations to show he was serious about his side, but the deal never happened. And his preformative cruelty did nothing to arrest the radicalisation of the Republican base. Kamala Harris attempted to flank Donald Trump on the issue in 2024, arguing that Democrats had attempted to pass an aggressive bill on border security that Trump had tanked. This was a plausible enough read of the negotiations, but it didn’t matter. Voters concerned about the border went to the more viscerally xenophobic candidate by large margins.

The UK provides an even starker case. Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, the country has embarked on what can only be described as a program of national economic suicide to address the “legitimate concerns” of nativists. They are louder and angrier than ever. The current Labour government has pledged to reduce (legal) immigration, and numbers are in fact falling significantly. But, again, it doesn’t matter. Prime minister Keir Starmer has arguably gone further than any liberal leader in the world to appease the rising far right, and has been rewarded with historically low approval ratings. Even in Denmark, the poster child of centrist appeasers, their Social Democrats, after moving to the right on this issue, were mauled in local elections, losing Copenhagen for the first time in a century.

Progressive activists, and those of us in media and academia have done a little better. But only a little. The left will challenge anti-immigrant arguments as a ‘divide and rule’ tactic of capitalist elites. The billionaires, it is argued, keep us fighting a culture war so that we won’t fight a class war.

There are elements of truth here, but this assumes a rationality in the ruling class that just isn’t there. A world of closed borders does not benefit the billionaires. The Brexit project made virtually everyone in the UK worse off. Poor people are poorer, but businesses—small and large—have also felt the impact. Finally, in framing the debate as a distraction we risk implying that it’s not important. We keep trying to change the conversation back to topics we feel more secure on (economic inequality), rather than counterattacking directly.

Often progressives will call out the motivations of the nativist project: it is not, contra reactionary centrist pleading, drawing on legitimate concerns, but racism. Men like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are bigots and must be opposed on that basis.

This has the virtue of being obviously true. It’s also a somewhat effective political attack line. But the liberal response can’t only be this. Voters have been told, over and over, that immigration is a problem. That it depresses wages, increases crime, stretches social services. That the country is full (whatever that means). What appears to have happened is a significant (and election determinative) block of people have accepted that, yes, the far right are racist, but they’re the only ones taking ‘the problem’ seriously. I’ve heard many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, say that while they find Trump or Reform distasteful, they also think we need someone unpleasant since their country is being ‘taken advantage of’.

The wealth and health of nations

The reality is that, even if those proposing further anti-immigrant measures weren't racist at all (and to be clear, they absolutely are), their policies would still be disastrous. Even current immigration regimes are far too restrictive and are massively harming us. I think we can no longer be content to try and defend the status quo. We have to take new ground.

For some on the left, there is a fear that high levels of ‘unskilled’ migration will depress wages for lower income native workers. But this just isn’t what the data says. The past 30 years of empirical research have broadly shown virtually no effect across developed countries. ‘They took our jobs’ is a self-sustaining delusion that it’s embarrassing left leaders are still falling for. It’s even more galling when the charge is made by people who are actively and explicitly against raising wages for those at the bottom. When Biden ‘ran the economy hot’ during the covid recovery, this really did raise wages for the lowest income brackets. The response from the right was apoplectic rage. Centrists in the press screamed that this would be inflationary. When a ‘soft landing’ showed these fears to be incorrect, they resolved to deny the data and discredit the experiment such that it could never happen again.

I want a progressive movement that is aggressively pro raising wages at the bottom and aggressively pro immigration. These are completely coherent goals. They don’t always have the same supporters, but they have the same enemies. It’s time to take the fight to them.

To start with, we should firmly reject the framing that there is some ‘right’ level of immigration. “How many is too many?” is a favorite challenge of the nativists. It’s the wrong question. The measure of a country's success is if its citizens are happy, healthy, and prosperous, not if an arbitrary number of people cross a border.

In focusing so much on the former, we have abandoned the latter. Nativism across the world has made us more divided, poorer, and literally sicker. And that’s before we even get to its exploitation by fascists.

Look at the phone in your pocket—it's materials, parts, and assembly happened in at least a dozen countries. No individual nation can do all of that. Only a superpower like the United States could even attempt to internalize all those processes, and that would certainly be at an incredible cost. When politicians talk of ‘made in America’ they have steel beams, not cellphones, in mind.

Likewise, in a complex modern economy, it's madness to think one country could exactly meet its labour needs in all sectors. Especially when you consider that these are always changing. It takes 10-15 years to train a doctor, but a country with staffing shortages of medical professionals needs that problem addressed now, not a decade from now. American liberals often reference farm jobs that ‘Americans don’t want to do’ when arguing for immigration. And it’s certainly true that agriculture needs non-native labour, but so do many sectors, across the income spectrum. There’s a reason Elon Musk broke (fascist) character to advocate for H-1B visas—he knows that the tech sector is structurally dependent on them. He just imagines, with the usual nativist naivety, that sectors he isn’t familiar with will work it out if confined to American workers. They won’t. The idea of pure national self-sufficiency is a preposterous myth, long past its sell by date. We live in a deeply interconnected world, and this has been true for at least 150 years.

What has changed is that as developed countries have aged (and birth rates dropped) we've needed immigration from developing countries at higher levels. Naturally, despite these often being the people who literally care for our parents, we’ve made them providing this service as difficult & demeaning as possible.

The UK is a clear case study in how grotesquely self-destructive this tendency is. Our health and care sectors are in absolute crisis and that is impacting everything else, both consequence and cause of our national decline. A decade and a half of Tory austerity has left the National Health Service (NHS) underfunded as demand has continued to rise. Providing care for someone with advanced cancer or dementia is both expensive, and incredibly labour intensive—requiring both day to day supervision, and a system of specialised medical professionals. We hence need a wide variety of workers, not all of whom we’re capable of producing natively (32% of NHS doctors are foreign born). Immigration restrictions mean that these roles are simply not being filled.

Starmer has repeatedly claimed that the country is “addicted” to foreign labour. A bizarre framing that acknowledges our interdependence, but casts it as a problem rather than a solution. Our government insists we can fill these massive staffing shortages by training more native healthcare workers. We can’t. For one thing, we need more doctors, nurses, and care workers now, not ten years from now. For another, the universities that train said professionals are also in absolute crisis as a result of our anti-immigration politics: foreign students were a key source of income, but this is drying up in the face of hostile visa rules and crackdowns. Finally, the aforementioned project of national economic suicide means we cannot pay competitive rates—or anything close to it. Brits do not want to spend a decade qualifying to be a doctor for a starting salary of £32,000 ($40,000).

And this failure is cascading. Families with older relatives with complex care needs can no longer find the support they need. Increasingly, NHS hospital beds are being used for them as there is simply nowhere else to go. This sucks up already stretched resources and staff time, which in turn means worse services for everyone else—longer waits to see a specialist, or for operations. A younger person, perhaps a parent with young children, with a cancer diagnosis they might otherwise have survived, now does not.

You know the ""is anyone on the plane a doctor?"" trope? That's our national situation. And when the person who stands up isn't white British, we reply that we’d actually rather die.

This is no less absurd than the mainstream, bi-partisan view on immigration in most developed democracies right now. Most people don’t see it because they’re not thinking through the causal chain (from restrictions to staffing shortages to outcomes). Part of going on the offensive is getting them to. Part of shaking off our timidity is believing we can.

Persuasion

Shortages of carers for our elderly, or specialist medical staff, are a particularly extreme case. But more mundane ones exist in all parts of advanced economies. As markets change, and nations specialise in different things, the norm is that some sectors will find themselves needing more workers, while in others too many workers compete for too few jobs (and hence benefit from the workers who are willing to travel for opportunities being allowed to do so).

The US is larger and more prosperous, the EU has internal freedom of movement, but both are still harmed by overly restrictive systems. Both would benefit from, not exactly more migration, but from greater ease of it—from people who want to move easily being able to fill skill gaps where they arise. Yet liberal parties the world over are too scared to say this.

It’s not just a temperamental timidity. There seems to be a tacit acceptance that electorates are simply not persuadable. Even as anti-immigrant measures cause economic harm that weakens support for incumbent parties, there’s a feeling that people would not tolerate being told the truth.

And yet, for all that public opinion isn’t favourable, it’s also very changeable. In the US, Republican opinion generally follows fox news to an almost comedic degree. Support for mass deportations went from 32% of republicans in 2016 to 88% in 2024 as it became a mainstay of Trump’s rhetoric. There’s no reason to think that, if we offered a positive vision of our own, Democrats’ opinion wouldn’t coalesce around it in the same way. In the UK, support for ending all inward migration drops by 2/3rds (45% to 15%) if you tell people doing so would mean NHS shortages. Given that would absolutely be the consequence, can we not make that case?

We liberals can have such a lack of confidence in our ability to persuade. Especially on immigration. I often hear “I agree, but the public won’t go for that”. Or, we get scared of a retort in advance—“if we say X, they’ll just say Y”.

The nativists will “just say Y’? OK, well, is “Y” true? Does it make sense? Or is it, in fact, society-destroying garbage? It is? Then say that. If their arguments are trash, then trash them. To quote, of all people, Tony Blair (who, whatever else he did, won elections), “the starting point of any campaign is to destroy the basis of [your opponents’] case.” If you allow their premises to stand, people will accept their conclusions.

So why aren't we? I think progressive timidity on this topic, in part, reflects the insecurities of our leaders. Not liking immigrants, you see, is what the “real” people think—the working class, the rural, the less affluent, the manual labourer, the straight, the white, the masculine, the male-coded elements of our society. Being pro-immigration automatically makes you less “real”—elite, effete, multicultural, overly cosmopolitan, queer, overly educated, email job, professional, female-coded—dismissive of, and ‘out of touch’ with, the “real” people of the country.

Authenticity

I’ve noticed when I really slam anti-immigration arguments, the reflexive response of many is to call me a snob. I get ‘class promoted’, becoming a “private school kid” who doesn’t know what life is like for “real people” out in the “real country”.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m definitely not a private school kid. And I grew up, and have lived for long periods in, the exact sort of “red wall”, northern parts of the UK nativists equate with maximal authenticity. And it’s fine to say things like this, to let people know where you’re coming from. But we shouldn’t stop with such a defensive move, we need to go on the offense—challenging the assumptions behind the charge.

We should note, for a start, how selective this sensitivity is. Sneering at the working class is just fine if you’re cutting food stamps, or removing family benefits, or cutting social services. The right will quickly jump to deploying some very ugly class (and race) stereotypes when advocating these. The centrists' handwringing about listening to the ‘voice of the forgotten man' is dropped the instant we start advocating for material benefits. Again, consider the real fanaticism they found in the US when faced with a progressive, pro-worker economic recovery under Biden.

And talking about “real” Americans, or “real” Brits, is just—at very best—a stupid framing. I’m not a more authentic Brit (who has more authority to define our national identity) because I was born in Grimsby, or grew up in the North East, or because I’m white and male. I’m not less of one because I’m socially liberal, or because I have a graduate degree and dual nationality. The vast majority of us are somewhere between the ‘real citizen’ and ‘out of touch elite’ caricatures.

Nor is it even true that nativist sentiment is some intrinsically working class thing. Just as often, it’s a luxury belief of affluent pensioners who can vote their distaste for a muti-cultural society without having to worry about the economic harm that causes the rest of us.

The poorest Americans still marginally prefer Democrats. Both Trump’s strongest support and strongest opposition are cross-class coalitions. Likewise in the UK, how the bottom income bracket (under £20,000, or $26,000) voted in the last election is actually pretty close to the national average: Labour 33%, Lib Dem 11, Green 8, Reform 17, Tory 24, other 7. Reform is a couple of points higher, but so are the Greens. Also the combined left-wing vote share is larger than the right one, and more of the least affluent Brits voted Green or Lib Dem than did Reform. If you want to essentialise the forgotten, “left behind” workers of the country, the data supports a socially progressive caricature more than a socially conservative one.

Of course, there is no such stereotype that captures the experience of all ‘working people’. And the one that our politicians and press impose on us is, frankly, insulting. I resent the assumption that I must dislike foreigners because of where I was born. Or that my high school friends who didn’t go to university must be bigots because of that, or because they work trade jobs. They absolutely aren't! There are of course some working class people who are nativists. But there is also a long history of workers' movements taking socially progressive positions. And there is a strong culture of aggressive social liberalism among many of the least affluent workers for those with eyes to see it.

I think the reason the snobbery charge has been allowed to silence liberalism to the degree it has is because it exploits an insecurity. Not for most of us necessarily, but for our leaders. In the UK, our politicians (and press) are usually awkward, uncharismatic upper-middle-class sorts, who genuinely are a bit out of touch. They carry totems to try and affirm a connection to ordinary people. Starmer’s father was a toolmaker, did you know? Labour candidate Alan Strickland took it several generations further, boasting ""my grandfather was the son of a miner"" in a campaign video. These dullards are hence incredibly exploitable: They don’t have a good handle on what ""ordinary people” think, but do read a lot of upper-class (in many cases literally aristocratic, or part of the UK’s de facto aristocracy) conservative writers in our press who claim to speak for them.

In the US case, reactionary centrists in the press are usually from middle-class backgrounds, have a fancy education, and have spent most of their lives in big, blue coastal cities. I think they’re uncomfortable with how all these things have been feminised by conservatives. Ventriloquizing (what they imagine to be) the voice of the common man to attack (female and queer-coded) social liberalism, is a way for them to attempt to re-affirm their masculinity within the symbolically gendered framework the country's politics operates within. The result is highly privileged New York Times writers lecturing queer barristers and bartenders about what working people think.

I don’t know how to say this more basically, but this is all complete nonsense and we have to get over it. You can’t lead an army if your main preoccupation is if your enemy likes you. Liberalism can neither accept nor afford leaders with these psychological hangups.

I don’t know about you, but in a fight for our lives, I want leaders who instinctively hate those trying to kill us. Conversely, I think troops wanting a general who does not openly sympathise with the enemy's cause is a reasonable enough minimum standard. I also think that even the less craven of us are so used to a defeatist framing that we need reminding how pernicious a creed nativism is—and that there is nothing natural or inevitable about it.

Freedom of movement

I recently found myself in Barcelona for a few days—an amazing city I always instinctively vibe with. One thing I kept thinking was, when I was young, I could have lived and worked here for a year without restriction. Or Prague, or Berlin, or Lucca, or any European city. And now no one can. We tore all that up for no good reason.

In my early twenties I traveled so much, working as I went. Pre-Brexit, we had freedom of movement in the EU and I—owing to my dad being American—had a US passport. It really made me who I am now, and I think I’m such a better, more grounded person for having been able to.

It wasn’t all positive, I was reckless, I made mistakes. You know that trope Americans like to tell of some distant ancestor arriving in a strange land with just their clothes and a few dollars? I’ve literally done that a half dozen times in my life. And it didn’t always go smoothly! I remember sleeping on a hard wood floor, in a freezing Boston apartment—a run down maze of small rooms owned by an elderly crack addict who’d make them available to passers through, in exchange for us coughing up some dollars towards his habit every now and then.

I picked up what work I could, gravitating towards campaign work—knocking doors for a political candidate, or fundraising for a progressive cause. Those roles are always hiring. I saw so much of the world with them, and talked to thousands of people from all walks of life, often volunteering myself for the more exciting sounding assignments. Want to go work a ballot initiative camping in Maine? Sure. A road trip across upstate New York in mid winter? Sounds great. And in some of those organisations, I ended up taking on much more responsibility. In the chaos of the early Trump era, I found myself running big projects at a young age. Some of my more risky moves paid off magnificently. At one point, I left my job, ducked the last month's rent I owed, and got a one-way train ticket to start a relationship with a woman in another city I’d known less than a week. She’s now my wife.

And doesn’t all that speak to some fundamental human need just as much as the desire for comfort and familiarity does? I’m hardly the only person to throw myself at the world in this way. Go to any small town, in the US, UK, or EU, listen to young people there and you’ll hear talk of “getting out”. If that is what they want, they should be free to make a go of it. Free movement with other countries increases their choices in doing so. And for that matter, think of the affluent conservative retirees who vote for this anti-immigrant crap. What do they want to do with their time? Travel!

Sorry nativism, but contrary to your claim to being universal, there is a deep seated human need for experience and adventure that your unseasoned dork ideology just can’t satisfy. Of course if someone finds deep fulfillment in living where their ancestors lived they should be able to do that—that’s the point of freedom! But the insistence that everyone else do the same is, I think, fundamentally inhuman.

And that is the consequence of nativism. Anti-immigrant types never really seem to understand that these relationships are reciprocal. Americans often joke about moving to Europe if things get bad. Partisans of both sides seem to imagine there’s some ‘politically disaffected Yank’ visa route. Those who try run headlong into some of the most unpleasant, restrictive, and expensive bureaucratic processes ever devised. When the UK stopped EU citizens from being able to work here, we lost the right to work there. A particularly stupid example of this is older, Brexit voting Brits living abroad, who were shocked to find their own legal status in jeopardy. Leopards and faces, to use the vernacular.

Reframing the debate

The great advantage of going on the attack, in both war and politics, is to fight the battle on your terms, not your opponents. One of the reasons the immigration debate feels so unwinnable, why we’re perpetually on the backfoot, is we fight it within the nativists' framing devices. On their chosen ground, so to speak.

For example, immigration rules are usually conceptualised as being a relationship between a nation (to which we belong) and outsiders (who do not) seeking entry. I think they’re better thought of as a relationship between nations. There is, for instance, an understanding between the US and UK that if the former provides a passport to one of its residents, the latter will allow them entry for a period of 6 months, but not to work or stay beyond that (and similar the other way round). The relationship between France and Italy in contrast, is that citizens of either can live in the other indefinitely and work (more or less) without restriction.

The French and Italian relationship is a better one. Both with respect to human freedom, and the economic benefits to those who do not travel. The UK has catastrophically harmed itself by opting out of this open system. Recent estimates suggest Brexit has cost us 90 billion pounds in annual revenues (three times the size of the ‘budget black hole’ the government is trying to fill) and that the average Brit is £3,500 a year worse off (or 10% of the median income).

EU freedom of movement worked. It’s a wonderful thing for people across the continent. One of the great success stories of the modern age. Something to be built upon, not apologized for. And yet this is virtually nowhere said. Occasionally, it will be pointed out that Brexit was a mistake, but for abstract ‘economic’ reasons. Part of going on the offensive will be progressives the world over using the sad story to show why anti-immigrant policies specifically make life worse for everyone.

People will often say they don’t support open borders because the public won’t go for it. I dislike the phrasing because it reinforces the nativist model that immigration rules are about a nation to which we belong and aliens outside of that. I think freedom of movement provides a better model for the world we want.

Britain should obviously never have left the EU, but nor should this be the end of our ambitions. I can think of no good reason why we also shouldn’t have a freedom of movement deal with the United States. We have historic links, the same language, and deeply interconnected cultures. This would provide astounding economic opportunities for Brits willing to travel to access much higher wages in the states. And trust me when I say there’s a lot of Americans who hold a special affection for, and fascination with, the old country. Who would take a pay cut to work here for a few years if we removed our intentionally exclusionary and expensive visa process. And both sides would bring with them skills, experience, and different perspectives. Everyone would benefit, this isn’t a zero sum game.

Talking of the US, we should explore a North American freedom of movement deal. Say Canada, USA, Mexico. These countries are likewise deeply historically, culturally, and economically connected. Think of the hundreds of billions we’d save in border enforcement alone (and what socially productive purposes that money could be used for instead). The harms caused by this regime we could likewise simply do away with. Many Americans claim they have no problem with Mexican migrants, just those who came here illegally. Taking this at face value, we can elegantly solve that problem by making all movement legal. The tearing down of ugly and intrusive border fencing would become a glorious symbol of human freedom on the march.

Nor should we limit our ambitions to the global north. Let’s start where we have the greatest connection and work out, aiming to find partners who will make mutually beneficial deals with us. Britain has a historic connection to any number of amazing countries through the Commonwealth. What would freedom of movement with, say, India look like? That’s basically unthinkable now, due to pervasive racist fears of being ‘swamped’ by ‘hordes’ of non-white aliens. But the few who’ve looked into it think it could work for both countries. A saner society would at least consider it.

Attacking nativism

Anti-immigration politics’ claim to represent some natural human sentiment is a strange one, when you think about it. One we have been too timid in aggressively undermining.

People will always have communities which they feel they belong to, but nativism requires quite a lot more than that: It says that people are not only part of communities, but the boundaries of those communities, their composition and internal norms, can never change. And that people will react with hostility to any attempt to do so.

But these things change all the time. At the time of the French revolution only 11% of the population spoke French. The remainder speaking regional languages and dialects. The modern nation—as a culturally, linguistically, and ethically homogeneous group—is an invention, and a surprisingly modern one. One that had to be imposed, often from the top down, often in the face of real opposition from those whose regional (or other) identities were stronger. This is not to say that we should become anarchists, it’s the structure that we have, but it can exist in better and worse forms.

And if distrust of those different to you is simply how people invariably feel, it’s odd that this sentiment must be stoked by endless lies and propaganda. There’s actually something very artificial about the views electorates hold on immigration—they can only be sustained in a one-sided information vacuum. People’s fears aren’t inevitable, they’re what you get when they’re force-fed demininising propaganda by the right and liberals are silent.

Actually, when I talk to ordinary nativists, I invariably find they don’t feel the things it claims to represent—pride, cultural fit, a sense of belonging. Rather these are things they desperately want to feel, and have come to believe that excluding others will allow them to. “Everyone else has their own culture, why can’t we?” is a common lament. It’s particularly stupid in America which, for better or worse, is the undisputed cultural hegimon of the world.

Even in the UK it's, at best, pathetic and, at worst, ridiculously hypocritical. Britain genuinely does have cultural products worth celebrating and heritage worth preserving. But the minute that threatens nativist bigotry, they’ll turn on it. The right-wing press lobbied hard to get sports presenter (and former England captain, something of a national fixture) Garry Lineker fired because he called the government's immigration policy “cruel”. Doctor Who actor (what could be more British than The Doctor?) David Tennant likewise drew their ire for being vocally pro trans rights. The National Trust (which preserves many of our historic buildings) was faced with attacks and boycotts for discussing the British role in the slave trade in some of it’s exhibits. Even the Church of England—a core, traditional part of our culture for hundreds of years—is regularly assailed for affirming the traditional Christian teaching of kindness to refugees. These people don’t love their country and culture, they often hate it!

And we haven't even reached the most flagrant hypocrisy of nativism. It’s natural, they aver, to prefer one’s countrymen in the same way we have a special affection for our families. This latter part is true, and this really is a deep constant in human nature across cultures and time. Family takes different forms, and everyone is different, but for most people the bonds to our children, our parents and partners, and our best friends who are like family, are the most important part of our lives.

And nothing—really nothing—is more hostile to these bonds than immigration systems. After marrying in America, my father became ill. We made the difficult decision to move back to the UK to help my family. The response of the British state (which, we should remind ourselves, is in an existential crisis due to lack of carers) was to make this incredibly difficult, expensive, and uncertain. We have spent tens of thousands on fees, additional taxes, and moving around. We have had to worry, again and again, that we would fall afoul of ever changing rules. We have had to live separately for periods. And, if the nativists have their way, this would not have been possible at all. I would have had to choose between being with my wife, or supporting a dying parent. I once asked a Labour MP how inflicting such choices on people (which their making the family visa routes more restrictive would absolutely do) increased social cohesion, or benefited the country in any way at all. They had no answer.

And this is a fairly minor instance. Across the US, Trump deportations are tearing wives from husbands, parents from children. All cheered on by the party of ‘family values.’ In the UK, for a foreign spouse to have legal status you must meet a certain income threshold. Effectively removing the right to family life from the poorest half of the country. I was just able to avoid the above choice, many are not. If the Tory Lam/Philip plan were enacted, 4-7 million legal residents would be deported, leaving perhaps 10-15 million families devastated.

Ultimately, nativism is not some universal and inevitable feeling. It does not reflect some core human need. Travel does—throughout history people have moved away from bad situations, and towards the hope of better ones. We have sought out new experiences and adventure. Family does—most of us need others, we want to give and receive love. Nativism is a perversion directly hostile to both. Indeed, in our world today it is arguably the greatest threat to them. Its exploitation by fascists is the greatest threat to free societies and free political systems.

And the anti-immigrant forces, in our current moment, are over extended. Brits listened to anti-immigrant campaigners and destroyed their economy. Most Americans are, at very best, uneasy about masked men abducting people from the streets. The world over, we are seeing the results of this ideology and they’re appalling. Nativism has always been a form of social suicide, but it packaged itself as serious, necessery, and respectable. Now it’s increasingly, and increasingly obviously, unhinged. Public opinion is already starting to drift our way, and that's before people have heard a full-throated progressive case. If we hit back hard—and directly—I think we might find the enemy line much weaker than was imagined.

Looking forward

Immigration is a good thing. It makes us wealthier, healthier, and more free. It is best understood as mutually beneficial deals between states.

We should, as in the UKs case, re-enter such deals where we left them. We can reverse our national decline any time we choose. And then we should pursue other deals on top of that. I think that gets us away from the framing of ‘letting people in’—rather, countries come to an arrangement that allows greater freedom for both.

In the US case, I know proposing a North American free movement block sounds unbelievably radical now. But, in an age of increasingly ‘two teams’ politics, I wonder if that became our side's position the base would rally to it, in the same way the right’s has rallied to mass deportations. I also wonder—I don’t know, but I wonder—if the UK and US having, in different ways, really demonstrated the brutality and stupidity of nativism might have created an opening. If overflowing hospitals, or masked men on the streets, have been shocking enough that people are open to hearing an alternative who wouldn’t have been otherwise. Of course it would provoke real howls of outrage from reactionary centrists, but that dead-end worldview is what we have to move beyond.

It would also be coherent. What we are saying on immigration would match our values, match the positions we take on other issues. It could all fit within a coherent story of progress and pluralistic freedom. I’m not insensitive to the difficulties. The calculus for politicians is challenging. But that’s no excuse for the rest of us. Liberals shouldn’t tell liberals “that’ll never happen”. I don't know that this is a debate we can win, but I also don’t know that we can’t.

And just say we did—there’s no moral arc of the universe that bends towards greater freedom, but nor is there some natural nativism that rules it out. What if we won? What if 100 years from now the world was dominated by prosperous, egalitarian, liberal democracies, of different kinds, and with their own vibrant cultures, but joined together in an international order of large, overlapping free movement zones.

I think people in that world would look back at ours with disbelief, much like we look back at slavery and witch burnings. Developed countries using state violence to tear families apart on a massive scale, to place innocent people in inhuman conditions, all so the remaining population can live poorer and die younger, will appear to them—correctly—as a sort of moral madness. It will be almost unfathomable to them why the majority of people thought such a thing was justifiable, much less necessary. Our current politics will be intelligible only as a mass psychosis into which entire nations fell.

These future people will also finally be able to assess nativism for what it is. A disgusting morbidity. The claim that, for the nativist to be happy, the state must restrict the life choices of everyone else, will sound perverse and preposterous to them. One of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological desires one hands over with a shudder to specialists in personality disorders.

The barriers between us and that future are those of beliefs. Much of what is holding us back on the liberal side is fear, and various insecurities. The fear at least I can understand. But we have seen the results of surrendering the field to the nativists. Of only offering cautious rebuttals, without a values-driven vision of our own. Of implicitly conceding that this is just how “real” people feel. It hasn’t worked, and it’s time to try something different.

A much better world is possible. A more prosperous one in which states do not sabotage their own economies at the behest of bigots. Where people willing to travel for opportunity can do so, and benefit everyone in the process. Where an aging population does not mean those with terminal cancer, or in cognitive decline, must live out their final years in indignity, fear, or squalor. Where young people can seek experience and adventure, and older people can retire where they wish. Where we can find love, and form families, across borders without harassment. A world, in a word, that is free.

The surge dramatically expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota amid heightened political and community tensions. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons, during an interview with Newsmax, called the crackdown the agency’s “largest immigration operation ever.”

Neither Lyons nor Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said how many officers were involved.

A person briefed on the operation told The Associated Press the Department of Homeland Security plans to dispatch as many as 2,000 officers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents’ vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied ICE officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.

Walz blasts surge

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as “a war that’s being waged against Minnesota.”

“You’re seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,” Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area’s Somali community, the largest in the U.S.,. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized federal agents for using “questionable methods” following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was “unlike any other day we’ve experienced.”

“It’s incredibly distressing,” Coleman said. “What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it’s an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.”

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

“We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,” said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Includes investigators focused on fraud

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino’s tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops hotel that canceled reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for “not meeting our standards and values” when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

It is the largest such detention facility in California.

Since its opening early last year, the detention center — which is operated by the company CoreCivic via a contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — has become one of the most notorious facilities.

In November, detainees held in California City brought a class action lawsuit alleging, among other things, that the staff there “routinely engage in abusive behavior and unreasonable use of force.” It also alleges that people “are routinely subjected to solitary confinement for conduct that should not be punished at all.”

On Dec. 19, California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote a letter to the Trump Administration detailing “dangerous and inadequate living conditions” endured by detainees. If even half of what he says is true, it should be intolerable. We should have learned from the horrors of slavery and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II that treating humans in an inhumane way leaves an indelible stain on our history.

And, unless something is done quickly to address the situation, things in immigration detention are going to get worse.

Trump’s inhumane plan

Late last month, The Washington Post ran a story about a Trump Administration immigrant detention plan so cruel that it could have been ripped from the pages of the Marquis de Sade’s playbook for sadism. The plan is to dramatically expand the number of facilities in which immigrants can be warehoused by using actual warehouses to hold them.

The administration hopes to utilize these facilities to expedite the movement of individuals from the moment they are picked up by ICE agents to the moment they are deported.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons told The Post. The article also states that the goal of the administration is “to deport immigrants as efficiently as Amazon moves packages.”

“Like Prime, but with human beings,” Lyons said.

Human beings treated like packages?

We must say, “not in the United States.” It is time for Congress to hold hearings to shed light on the cruelty currently happening in these facilities and halt the administration’s warehouse plan.

As The Post notes, “Such structures are designed for storage and shipping, not human habitation ... (for) thousands of full-time residents.”

Lawless places

It is already clear that existing ICE detention facilities across the country are lawless places not fit for human habitation. The immigrants who are housed there are being subject to dreadful conditions of confinement.

Remember Alligator Alcatraz? PBS reminds us that “President Donald Trump toured (the Everglades Detention Facility) in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide.”

A few months after that well-publicized tour, Alligator Alcatraz has become a nightmare for people who are sent there. Amnesty International notes that they “are living in inhuman and unsanitary conditions ... (M)edical care is inconsistent, inadequate or denied all together.” Moreover, people held there are “always shackled when they were outside their cage.”

Meanwhile, the ICE facility at Fort Bliss, Texas — the largest such facility in the country — “is a massive tent camp … located in the middle of the desert on a military base.”

In December, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to ICE and to relevant Congressional Committees about Fort Bliss alleging that “detained immigrants are held for weeks at a time ... in cramped, squalid soft-sided tents with 72 people per unit, where toilets and showers flood eating areas with raw sewage.

“As immigrants detained at Ft. Bliss report, officers have beaten detainees and used threats of violence, criminal charges and imprisonment in attempts to coerce people held at Ft. Bliss to leave the United States and cross the border into Mexico.”

We can’t expect the courts to stop such treatment because prior judicial decisions suggest that detainees have less legal protection than prisoners. Because their detention is not regarded as punitive, it is not covered by the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

But as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held more than 20 years ago: “(A civil) detainee is entitled to ‘more considerate treatment’ than his criminally-detained counterparts.“ And, according to the court, a civil detainee should not be “confined in conditions identical to, similar to or more restrictive than those in which criminal counterparts are held.”

Today, I am not confident that today’s Supreme Court would apply such a principle to people in Trump’s immigration detention gulag. That is why it is up to the American people and Congress to reject what the administration is doing in California City, Alligator Alcatraz, Fort Bliss and other detention centers.

Humans, whatever their immigration status, should never be treated as “packages.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/9fke9k/picture313788624/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/6b4f79c6-d7a1-4803-a314-8979950cb8e0,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:33.355424

Sebastian, who asked to be identified by his first name because of his ongoing immigration case, says he was happy to learn U.S. forces had captured President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela in the early hours of Jan. 3.

""I felt a relief, because I thought that there'd be a radical change in the country,"" he told NPR. ""Maybe things were going to be different.""

But in a press conference later that day, President Trump said his administration had a conversation with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's deputy and vice president. Trump said his administration was working with her toward U.S. plans to run the country.

That announcement left Sebastian disappointed. He said he feels the danger is still as present in Venezuela.

But the Trump administration says it is safe for Venezuelans to go back to their country, especially those who were in the U.S. with temporary protected status, or TPS. The administration ended the program for more than 600,000 Venezuelans last year, saying then that conditions in the country had improved.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told Fox News on Sunday, ""the great news for those who are here from Venezuela on temporary protected status is that now they can go home with hope for their country — a country that they love — that there is going to be peace, prosperity and stability.""

But Sebastian, who came to the U.S. in 2023 and had TPS, said that does not make sense.

""The Trump administration has been saying for a year the conditions have changed for good in Venezuela,"" Sebastian said. ""But I would ask, if the U.S. has to extract a man who took over the government, how am I supposed to believe that the situation in Venezuela is good? It's contradictory, I see the opposite — the situation is worse.""

The Department of State has advised U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela ""due to severe risks to Americans, including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.""

On Monday, at least 14 journalists — most from international news organizations — were detained in Venezuela, according to Venezuela's National Union of Press Workers. There are also reports that armed groups are already working to suppress any support for Maduro's ouster.

Luis Falcón said going back to Venezuela under these conditions can put those returning at extreme risk. He came to the U.S. in 2017 after fleeing persecution.

He used to work for the Presidential Honor Guard, the security detail assigned to presidents and their family members. But after retiring in 2009, he started to join protests against the Maduro government. Authorities threatened him with jail time for betraying the country, and he decided to leave Venezuela.

""I'm grateful for the big step taken in Venezuela,"" Falcón said. ""But this is the beginning of the end. There's still a long road ahead for Venezuela to become a country of liberties, opportunities and justice for those Venezuelans who have been part of the opposition.""

He said returning now is impossible.

""Putting a foot back in Venezuela means I will be taken to jail, tortured, and potentially killed,"" Falcón said.

He says TPS should be restored for Venezuelans until there's a transition of government there. But the Trump administration has doubled down that Venezuelans in the country with temporary status must leave.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that ""Venezuela today is more free than it was yesterday."" She added that every individual under TPS ""has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward.""

However, immigration attorneys said that's misleading.

""Saying that someone can apply for refugee status within the U.S. — the generous interpretation is that she misspoke,"" said Lily Axelrod, an immigration lawyer based in Memphis, Tenn. ""The less generous interpretation is that she doesn't know what she's talking about or is lying.""

To apply for refugee status, she says, an immigrant must be outside the U.S. Axelrod said Venezuelans in the U.S. could still apply for asylum, although that could be a challenge, especially after the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions in November.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+142/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9a%2F19%2F70374f9d4974a2a7f4dcefb6101f%2F260105-nyre-josealvaradojr-30.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 08:57:33.590085

The challenge to Trump’s tariffs has been one of the most closely watched cases on the court’s docket amid the broader impact on the global economy.

In a social media post on Friday, Trump said such a ruling would be a “terrible blow” to the US.

“Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE,” Trump said in another post on Monday.

However, data on this is mixed. The US gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, marking the biggest increase in two years. Meanwhile, US job growth has slowed, with sectors heavily exposed to tariffs seeing little to no job growth.

“Jobs in sectors with higher import exposure grew more slowly than jobs in sectors with lower import exposure, suggesting tariffs may have weighed on employment,” Johannes Matschke, senior economist for the Kansas City branch of the Federal Reserve, said in an analysis in December.

Legal arguments

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in February 2025 on goods imported from individual countries to address, what he called, a national emergency related to US trade deficits.

Arguments challenging the legality of the decision began in November. At the time, the court’s liberal and some conservative justices had doubts about the legality of using the 1977 act.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed during his first term, was among those sceptical.

“Congress, as a practical matter, can’t get this power back once it’s handed it over to the president,” Gorsuch said at the time.

Chief Justice John Roberts told Solicitor General D John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the administration, that imposing tariffs and taxes “has always been the core power of Congress”.

The act grants broad executive authority to wield economic power in the case of a national emergency.

The matter reached the Supreme Court after the lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, finding that the use of the law exceeded the administration’s authority.

Among the courts that ruled against the White House was the Court of International Trade. In May, the New York court said that Congress, and not the executive branch, has “exclusive authority to regulate commerce”. This decision was upheld in a Washington, DC, appeals court in August.

Legal experts believe it is likely that the high court will uphold lower court decisions.

“My sense is that, given the different justices’ concerns, the Supreme Court will decide that IEEPA does not provide the ability for the Trump administration to adopt the tariffs,” Greg Shaffer, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera.

If the Trump administration were to lose the case, the US would need to refund some of the tariffs.

“It [ruling against the administration] would mean that those who paid tariffs that were imposed illegally would have to be reimbursed. I would think that that would be the outcome,” Shaffer added.

In September, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the US would “have to give a refund on about half the tariffs”.

There’s more to come in 2026. The lawsuits are part of a coordinated legal strategy by Democratic AGs in 22 states and the District of Columbia to resist the ever-widening power of the executive branch.

It’s not unusual for states to sue an administration; the party not in the White House has often turned to the courts. But it’s one of the few pathways for Democrats now, since Republicans hold the presidency, both chambers of Congress and have appointed a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And Trump in his second term has taken a much broader view of presidential power than previous administrations, asserting far more authority than his predecessors.

Democrats hope to retake at least one chamber of Congress in November’s midterm elections. But for most of the coming year, the party will be relying on AG court challenges as their main venue to take on Trump.

‘A boundless power’: Democratic states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago

One of the most prolific AGs is Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who has led or joined 52 lawsuits against this Trump administration.

“It’s not a slogan or a political brand,” Rayfield said of the coalition in an email interview with Stateline. “It’s a working partnership. When we coordinate, we’re able to defend the constitutional balance, push back when a president overreaches, and make sure our residents aren’t left paying the price for unlawful decisions coming out of Washington.”

The state AGs have brought cases over Trump’s tariffs and National Guard deployments. They’ve also fought cuts to federal research, education programs, food assistance, disaster recovery, health care and housing. And they say it’s their job to maintain core civil rights protections as well as stick up for the people in their state who, they argue, are harmed by the whims of the president’s executive orders.

“None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez told Source New Mexico.

Since the beginning of 2025, the attorneys general have toured the country on multistate listening tours and have touted their accomplishments on progressive legal podcasts. They’ve won 40 of the 51 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.

The AGs are not alone in taking legal action. Individuals, businesses, labor unions, associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 554 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers, according to Just Security, a daily digital law policy journal with a litigation tracker that monitors challenges to Trump administration executive actions.

But the attorney general coalition serves as “a coordinated, quick-moving and high-capacity force protecting the rule of law, federal funding streams, and people’s rights,” said Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project, which helps state and local governments partner on litigation that protects and advances civil rights.

The attorneys general have proven such a successful coalition that the Public Rights Project is adopting a similar approach that makes it easier for cities and counties to pool expertise, coordinate legal theories and act collectively, Miller said.

“The rule of law is ultimately about people,” Miller said. “When courts enforce the law, families stay housed, public health and emergency services stay open, and local leaders can govern without political coercion. That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.”

Immediate action

Democratic AGs began filing their multistate lawsuits the day after Trump took office, challenging the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The immediate legal action was intended to send a clear message to the Trump administration that state attorneys general will “stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring.

Rayfield said some days their work aims to build an emergency firewall to halt unlawful presidential actions — such as deploying the National Guard. Other days, it’s more targeted, fact-driven litigation designed to keep money, benefits and services flowing to states.

In December, Rayfield, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown led a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the governor of Pennsylvania in challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for threatening to punish doctors, hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care.

Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

In early November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments from Oregon’s then-solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States. Rayfield and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes began discussing a tariff lawsuit in April, before a joint appearance at a town hall in Oregon. Both had been considering it, but it was their in-person discussion that led to the collaboration, Mayes said during a panel discussion hosted by the “Legal AF” podcast on the MeidasTouch Network.

“This is not what I get up every day wanting to do,” Mayes told Cronkite News outside the Supreme Court, after Gutman argued the tariff case. “But if Donald Trump decides to violate the Constitution, violate statute, or harm the people of Arizona, I’m going to file that lawsuit.”

After Trump’s 2024 election, Democratic attorneys general began meeting almost daily over Zoom to prepare their legal approach for a second term. This time around, they had a better sense for what was coming because it was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s agenda so far.

As they enter their second year of legal collaboration, the AGs continue to meet regularly, but because they’ve developed close working relationships, it’s at a “more sustainable cadence,” Rayfield said.

Republicans sue, too

Republican attorneys general say they, too, are taking action to protect state sovereignty. Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post in November that lawsuits emerging from progressive states, particularly state- and municipal-driven cases in state courts over climate change, are “as much of a threat to state sovereignty as the federal government” as well as an attempt to “remake the nation in the image of progressive enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.”

“They reach into states like Alaska with their rules and regulations,” Cox wrote. “They push misguided legal theories targeting ordinary Americans. And they file lawsuits that would give state courts in ideologically aligned jurisdictions the chance to control the economies of states like mine.”

Republican attorneys general have been largely supportive of the president’s second-term agenda, including supporting the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Led by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, Republican attorneys general in 26 states sent a letter in support of such a mobilization in June in Los Angeles, describing it as “the right response — and one we fully support.” And as recently as October, Republican attorneys general in 16 states wrote a letter supporting the Trump administration’s attacks on boats it says are smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

State attorneys general have long taken on the executive branch, no matter who was in power.

Democratic attorneys general filed 138 multistate lawsuits against federal agencies during Trump’s first administration, according to a 2020 assessment by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee.

And some Republican attorneys general were especially litigious during the Biden administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton famously sued the Biden administration 106 times, including a suit challenging the administration’s offshore drilling policy in the final days of the presidency. Paxton followed in the footsteps of his Republican predecessor, now-Gov. Greg Abbott, who sued the Obama administration 31 times as a Republican attorney general: “I go to the office. I sue the federal government. Then I go home,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2012.

20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Attorneys general in more progressive states say their actions during the current administration have kept their states from losing billions of dollars in federal funds that would have otherwise been blocked for schools, public health, domestic violence prevention and other services. In Oregon, it’s an estimated $4.5 billion, Rayfield said. Arizona estimates it has held on to $1.5 billion. In California, it’s $168 billion.

In Oregon, one of the lawsuit hearings this fall drew an audience so large that an overflow courtroom adjacent to a packed main federal courtroom was needed. A crowd quietly watched arguments on a video display as lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops was not only a vast federal overreach, but also a threat to state sovereignty and public safety.

The administration said it deployed the Guard to protect federal agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department described protesters as “vicious and cruel radicals” for their demonstrations outside of an ICE facility in Portland, the phrase elicited muffled snickers from the otherwise decorous courtroom observers.

Among the protesters dominating news reports and social media feeds was a 20-something in a chicken costume. Other peaceful protesters spawned a new symbol of resistance: inflatable frog costumes. And naked bike riders rolled up en masse to the ICE facility, too, braving a cold, wet day and exposure on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.”

But the issue in front of U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut was no laughing matter.

Oregon’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s National Guard deployment was a critical public safety outcome for the state, Rayfield said. It prevented troops from mobilizing in Portland, forestalling what he described as “the kind of escalation that could have caused real harm.”

Attorneys general are prepared in 2026 to monitor and enforce their courtroom victories, Rayfield said. He and other state officials and local prosecutors have warned U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that excessive force by DHS officers won’t be tolerated during immigration enforcement activities. If warranted, they’ll refer them for prosecution, he said.

“That isn’t just a legal win — it’s a safety win,” Rayfield said. “The president cannot use federalization as a shortcut to move troops into American cities without lawful cause. That matters for Portland, and it matters for every state watching what happened here.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Democratic-AGs.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:40.751053

Tim Walz said, his decision to end his bid for a third term as Minnesota’s governor came down to this: Facing a torrent of threats and taunts from the Trump administration over a fraud scandal that has plagued the state’s social services system, he concluded that abandoning his political campaign might shield his constituents from further harm.

“I don’t think any governor in history has had to fight a war against the federal government every single day,” Mr. Walz told reporters on Tuesday in his first lengthy remarks about his decision, announced on Monday, to quit the race.

The announcement came a few weeks after the White House began portraying Mr. Walz, a former vice-presidential candidate and member of Congress, as an avatar of Democratic misgovernance. In early December, federal agencies began threatening to cut funding for Minnesota programs in response to a sprawling criminal investigation into fraud in a Covid-19 program meant to feed children and other safety net programs overseen by the state. Federal prosecutors have asserted that as much as $9 billion might have been stolen.

The White House simultaneously launched an immigration crackdown in Minnesota as the president railed against the state’s Somali diaspora, noting that a majority of defendants charged in the fraud cases are of Somali origin. Last week, Republicans on Capitol Hill scheduled a hearing about Minnesota’s fraud scandal, and demanded that Mr. Walz testify.

Mr. Walz, who was first elected in 2018 and whose current term in office will end early next year, pledged to continue tightening oversight of safety net programs that proved easy to defraud. Speaking defiantly, he also said that his critics should not expect him to spend his remaining year in office being cowed.

“I have more energy today than I’ve ever had,” Mr. Walz, 61, told reporters at Tuesday’s news conference, where he and colleagues announced the rollout of a new paid family and medical leave program for the state, one of his signature legislative initiatives. “I am committed to this state more than I have ever been.”

Being unburdened from the constraints and demands of a campaign, he said, would allow him to focus on fighting fraud and protecting immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. Minnesotans in the months ahead.

“The attacks on Minnesota are far beyond me, and it’s hurting Minnesotans,” said Mr. Walz, who called the president’s insults toward Somalis in the state “absolutely unconscionable.”

Asked to respond to the governor’s comments, a White House spokeswoman said the administration’s efforts to combat fraud and illegal immigration in Minnesota would continue.

“Dropping out of the race won’t shield him from the consequences of his actions,” the spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said in an emailed statement, which urged the governor to apologize for allowing “tax dollars to be misused so badly.”

The governor said that Republicans in the closely split Legislature should brace for a confrontational session in the coming weeks, adding that he intends to press them to vote on gun control bills and other measures he feels strongly about.

“Expect for the next 11 months for me to ride you like you’ve never been ridden, to make sure that you’re doing your job,” he said.

Mr. Walz said he had decided to drop out of the race over the holidays after conversations with members of his family. In a podcast interview recorded Monday, his daughter, Hope Walz, said that the federal scrutiny of Minnesota reflects that “Trump just hates” her father.

Part of the reason he stepped aside was his belief that doing so stood to “kind of get that target off of Minnesota,” she said in the show “One Hour Detours.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/us/06nat-walz-speaks-1/06nat-walz-speaks-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 06:58:11.482885

Applicants must agree to the terms of the bond through the U.S. Treasury Department’s online payment platform, Pay.gov, the State Department said.

The U.S. government has said the bonds seek to deter visitors from overstaying their visas intended for tourism or business purposes.

According to the audit, the Department of Human Services distributed more than $425 million in grants to 830 grantees between July 1, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2024.

One auditor noted that several documents were created by the Behavioral Health Administration only after the audit began and had been backdated in response to document requests.

Two grantees were overpaid, and the Behavioral Health Administration paid some grantees for work performed before it fully executed the grant agreements, according to the audit. The agency also made payments to grantees for costs that were either not incurred or not properly supported by source documents.

In a survey of employees at the Behavioral Health Administration, the report says 73% of respondents said they did not receive sufficient training to manage grants.

""Executive leadership has repetitively shown staff that they won't take the staff's concerns or questions seriously until something serious happens or it makes the news,"" one employee wrote in the survey.

State Sen. Mark Koran, R-North Branch, a member of the Legislative Audit Commission, says the audit shows that Department of Human Services leadership ""failed at every level.""

""The OLA report shows a complete breakdown in how DHS's Behavioral Health Administration manages hundreds of millions in taxpayer-funded grants,"" Koran said. ""BHA failed to verify that grantees were providing the services they were paid for, failed to put basic financial controls in place, and then created documentation after the fact to mislead auditors.""

Temporary commissioner for the Department of Human Services, Shireen Gandhi, said she was ""shocked"" to learn the information included in the audit.

""With respect to the audit report, while it's upsetting that DHS has findings in areas we have placed concerted effort, the OLA's report highlights the importance of the grant compliance work already underway at the department. And the findings provide us with a road map for our focus going forward to continue strengthening oversight and integrity of behavioral health grants,"" Gandhi said. ""I take the report seriously, I accept responsibility for the findings, and I will ensure DHS closes the findings.""

The report comes amid a widening fraud scandal in the state. Criticism about Minnesota's fraud caused Gov. Tim Walz to announce on Monday that he is dropping his bid to be reelected to a third term.

On Sunday, the Trump administration began a massive deployment of hundreds of DHS agents to the Twin Cities area. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to look into alleged fraud cases following last month's investigation by federal agents in Minneapolis that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said was for ""child care and other rampant fraud.""

More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.

Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered ""large-scale fraud"" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/04/3e591d27-7363-4260-a4c2-7fddcbc90859/thumbnail/1200x630g8/75f5365ffce9a29d4ae2457a0fc61ec5/gettyimages-2237567426.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:57:19.185133

But the data available for 2025 show ICE agents in Hawaiʻi conducted 194 arrests between Jan. 8 and Oct. 15, up from 52 arrests the year before under the Biden administration.
Based on the available 2025 data, there were an average of 20 arrests per month in Hawaiʻi last year, compared to four per month in 2024.
By May, ICE had conducted 128 arrests in Hawaiʻi; 31 arrests were made over the same period in 2024.
The ICE data does not specify where most of the at-large arrests occurred.","Updated tallies are not yet complete but already eclipse those in 2024. Data show immigration arrests are increasingly likely to take place at ICE offices and at the state’s civil court houses.

Arrests and removals by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Hawaiʻi through October were quadruple those in all of 2024, based on ICE operations data.

The exact numbers for the full calendar year won’t be available until mid-March due to delays in data releases by the Department of Homeland Security. But the data available for 2025 show ICE agents in Hawaiʻi conducted 194 arrests between Jan. 8 and Oct. 15, up from 52 arrests the year before under the Biden administration.

Those numbers are certain to rise. They do not include dozens of arrests made on Kauaʻi in early November at six properties in Kapahi and Kalāheo used as workforce housing by a cleaning contractor, Hawaii Care and Cleaning Inc.

Citizens of Mexico made up nearly a quarter of all those detained by ICE in Hawaiʻi so far in 2025, followed by Chinese nationals, and citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia. But more than 100 other nationalities were represented.

Arrests increasingly occurred when people came to ICE offices for mandatory check-ins or turned up at state courthouses on matters unrelated to immigration, Neribel Chardon, a senior staff attorney with The Legal Clinic, said Monday.

Chardon, one of a handful of pro bono attorneys in Hawaiʻi, said ICE personnel can usually find some grounds for arresting someone. That can include failing to update contact details with the immigration court or missing a notice to appear.

Those decisions are hard for attorneys to appeal, she said, “because the person failed to comply with their obligations, and they ended up in detention.”

She said she had not seen an increase in arrests in immigration court as had been reported in other states.

The data was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy Deportation Data Project and dates back to Sept.1, 2023. Arrests or apprehensions made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at ports of entry, including airports, are not included in the count.

Based on the available 2025 data, there were an average of 20 arrests per month in Hawaiʻi last year, compared to four per month in 2024. The uptick began immediately after the Trump inauguration on Jan. 20. By May, ICE had conducted 128 arrests in Hawaiʻi; 31 arrests were made over the same period in 2024.

Until the 44 Kauaʻi arrests in November, May was officially the month with the highest number of arrests – 34. Almost all of them took place on May 6 and 7 when ICE agents detained workers from Central America at coffee plantations on the Big Island.

The data shows that most of the arrests this year were “at-large”, meaning they occurred in public spaces such as courts, streets and workplaces, rather than in facilities where people are already incarcerated.

The ICE data does not specify where most of the at-large arrests occurred.

Asked for comment, ICE responded with an emailed statement last week that arrests reflected the agency’s “mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. So far, DHS has arrested over 622,000 illegal aliens, and we have no plans of stopping or slowing down.”

After that initial surge in immigration arrests in Hawaiʻi in the first five months of the Trump administration, arrests dropped off from June through October, when agents made 61 arrests — or about half as many. That ran counter to the trend nationally, where the rate of administrative arrests increased by about 60%, according to analysis by The Washington Post.

Some jurisdictions saw far greater spikes.

The District of Columbia saw a fivefold increase in arrests, the highest in the nation according to the Deportation Data Project, while New Mexico saw a fourfold increase.

Montana was the only other state that saw a fall in administrative arrests similar to Hawaiʻi, but the number of arrests in Montana and Hawaiʻi is relatively small compared to states like Texas, skewing percentage comparisons.

ICE media did not respond to a question about the downturn. Analysis of the same data by the Prison Policy Institute found that arrest rates were higher in states that fully cooperated with the Trump administration, which has set a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

Current estimates are that ICE is detaining 1,000 people per day, and there are approximately 605,000 people in detention nationwide.

Forced Removals And Voluntary Departures Up

Other indicators published by the Deportation Data Project and the tracreports.org site at Syracuse University also show how overall increases in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration have played out in the islands.

Those include an uptick in both the number of requests by ICE to Hawaiʻi authorities, such as county police, to detain individuals for 48 hours. By mid-October ICE in Hawaiʻi had requested 71 detainers, 22 more than the 49 requested during 2024.

Detainer requests are the legal mechanism for holding individuals until ICE agents can take them into custody for alleged immigration or criminal violations. In some mainland jurisdictions, local law enforcement has notified ICE about individuals in their custody who they suspect might also have immigration violations, under memoranda of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security.

Local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration actions has been controversial across the islands. In response, representatives of local law enforcement said last April they were not actively participating in immigration enforcement operations under existing agreements with DHS — other than complying with the detainers.

Detainers for people being held in cells at the Honolulu Police Department and the Oʻahu Community Correctional Facility make up over 40% of the running total for 2025. There was also a large increase in the average daily number of inmates held in the Honolulu federal detention center, which houses ICE detainees, including some from the mainland.

The average daily number of ICE detainees at FDC Honolulu in January 2025 was 15. At the end of November, it was 81, according to agency data published on tracreports.org.

As of Oct. 15, ICE data showed 218 individuals had been booked into FDC Honolulu, exceeding the 130 detainees booked in during 2024. That number includes detainees arrested by ICE on the mainland housed at the Honolulu facility while awaiting proceedings.

In July, ICE issued a departmental memo requiring the mandatory detention of all immigrants who entered the United States without inspection, a move that also restricts their access to bond hearings before an immigration judge.

Chardon said it has been increasingly difficult to get her clients released on bond under the revised guidelines, even though there was evidence that federal judges were pushing back on the mandatory detention policy, according to reporting by Politico.

The federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to provide 125 beds to the Department of Homeland Security under a new agreement approved in February, Civil Beat confirmed. That’s resulted in ICE detainees from as far away as Florida being temporarily housed there, local immigration attorneys said.

Of those booked into the Honolulu facility in 2025 up to mid-October, 121 were detained for alleged immigration violations, 66 had previous criminal convictions, and 31 had pending criminal charges.

The data also shows that more people were removed by ICE or chose to leave Hawaiʻi voluntarily in 2025 than in 2024, however the total won’t be available until mid-March.

The final disposition of 224 people released from FDC Honolulu so far in 2025 is shown in a dataset of “Detention Stints” — a log of when detainees were booked in and booked out, and the reason for their release from Honolulu, including transfers to a facility elsewhere. That number includes people arrested in 2024 and released in 2025.

As of Oct. 15, 106 people had been deported from Hawaiʻi, compared to 113 forced removals in all of 2024. But using a daily rate to measure the difference in the rates of removals year-over-year, 143 people could be expected to have been deported by Dec. 31 — a 35% increase over 2024.

Already, far more people have chosen to depart voluntarily in 2025 than in 2024, with 30 leaving so far, compared to two individuals the previous year.

The Trump administration is promoting a self-deportation program that offers undocumented people a $3,000 payment and a free flight to their destination.

“We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right, legal way to live the American dream,” the ICE emailed statement said.

Chardon said that voluntary self-removal could be risky for undocumented people looking to get safely out of the U.S. because they could still be arrested and detained if Customs and Border Patrol agents at the airport determine they had entered the country illegally.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2025/11/26113616/IMG_6805-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:57:06.528821

Reyes noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified “immediate security challenges” in the country last year.
The DHS under the Trump administration has voided 12 designations for 11 countries, drawing lawsuits in courts across the country.
A New York judge blocked the agency last year from removing TPS protections early for Haitians in the US.
But the agency months later issued a Federal Register notice that it would remove protections when they’re set to expire in February, arguing that conditions had improved enough in the country to remove protections.
Reyes probed government lawyers over the decision to remove protections for Haitians.","A Washington, DC federal judge pressed lawyers for the Trump administration on how Haitian immigrants targeted for removal from the US could safely return to a country deemed unsafe for travel by the government.

Judge Ana C. Reyes noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified “immediate security challenges” in the country last year. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits civilian US aircraft from operating in portions of Haitian airspace because of security forces’ inability to prevent attacks from terrorist groups, she said.

“Can you explain to me how it’s safe to return to a country or live in a country when it’s not even safe to fly into that country?” she asked.

The District Court for the District of Columbia case is one of multiple legal challenges to the Department of Homeland Security’s termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, stripping lawful status and work authorization for more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants in the US.

TPS allows immigrants from designated countries to stay in the US for up to 18 months when conditions like armed conflict make it unsafe to return. The DHS under the Trump administration has voided 12 designations for 11 countries, drawing lawsuits in courts across the country.

A New York judge blocked the agency last year from removing TPS protections early for Haitians in the US. But the agency months later issued a Federal Register notice that it would remove protections when they’re set to expire in February, arguing that conditions had improved enough in the country to remove protections.

Reyes probed government lawyers over the decision to remove protections for Haitians. When Justice Department attorney Dhruman Sampat said he wasn’t a foreign policy expert in response to her query on air travel, Reyes responded “I’m just asking as a matter of logic.”

She also asked why it’s a national interest to remove Haitians. The government has argued that the secretary has broad discretion to make determinations of the national interest that can’t be reviewed by the courts.

Reyes asked whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could decide it’s in the national interest to remove Haitians because she “doesn’t like vanilla ice cream.” Sampat quipped that it could be a possible economic consideration for a decision.

“Listen to yourself,” Reyes said. “I understand you’re in a tough spot, but just take a breath and listen to yourself.”

Hearings on the litigation will continue Wednesday. Reyes said before adjourning that her critiques of government attorneys have generated significant press coverage. She added that counsel for DHS had done a “phenomenally good job” in the hearing.

Like the Hispanic and Latino communities, as well as other migrant groups across the U.S., Asian families live under constant threat of unlawful detentions, family separations, neglect, abuse and trauma at for-profit prisons.
In the 19th century, our nation’s first mass deportation laws targeted the surveillance, registration and detention of Chinese people living in the American West.
Last year, a survey by the Asian American Foundation reported that 63% of Asians now feel unsafe because of their race.
The five deaths of Asian nationals in ICE custody in 2025 are not just isolated tragedies.","More than 30 people died while being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2025, marking it as the deadliest year for those held in custody by the agency in two decades. At least five of the detainees who died were Asian nationals: Chaofeng Ge, Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, Tien Xuan Phan, Kaiyin Wong and Huabing Xie. So far their deaths have received little public attention, even as ICE increases raids, expands capacity at its facilities and accelerates deportations across the country.

As I grieve these deaths, I’ve also witnessed ways that mass deportations have induced palpable fear throughout the Asian American community. Like the Hispanic and Latino communities, as well as other migrant groups across the U.S., Asian families live under constant threat of unlawful detentions, family separations, neglect, abuse and trauma at for-profit prisons.

In August, ICE guards found 32-year-old Chaofeng Ge hanging in a shower stall at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa. Although investigators ruled Ge’s death a suicide, the autopsy report stated that he was found with his hands and feet tied behind his back. Despite these troubling circumstances, the federal government has yet to release the full records regarding Ge’s death to his family. Chaofeng’s brother filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in November seeking transparency and accountability, and complained that the prison provided no Mandarin interpretation, leaving his brother isolated and possibly without access to medical care or mental healthcare while in custody.

Seven detainees at the California City Immigration Processing Center have made similar claims, accusing ICE of inhumane conditions inside its network of for-profit detention centers, including delayed medical care, inadequate food and water, and limited access to interpreters. Things are likely to only get worse unless the corporate profiteering that drives mass detention ends now.

Ge’s death points not only to the dangerous conditions inside ICE facilities, but also to the wider climate of terror that mass deportation policies have instilled in large segments of our community. Currently, 1 in 7 Asian immigrants living in the U.S. are undocumented and under imminent threat of removal, and undocumented Asian students represent a significant share of the population, accounting for approximately 16.5% of those eligible for DACA benefits.

Given the widespread and devastating impact of ICE arrests, more than 70% of Asian Americans now disapprove of President Trump’s immigration policies, arguing that his mass deportation practices have gone too far.

Trump’s policies are largely a continuation of immigration laws that have historically excluded Asian Americans. In the 19th century, our nation’s first mass deportation laws targeted the surveillance, registration and detention of Chinese people living in the American West. My family’s own immigration records from a century ago speak of my great-grand-uncle’s removal and of my grandparents’ detainment at the Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco.

Even though my grandfather was a native-born American citizen, his bride was imprisoned by armed guards for weeks because the government had racially profiled the two as illegal immigrants. White witnesses were required to testify on my grandfather’s birthright citizenship, and my grandmother was required to correctly answer a 56-question interrogation or else be deported. The poems of Chinese prisoners inscribed on the walls of the Angel Island immigration center speak to the fear and injustice that they and thousands more endured.

The use of deportations as a form of international segregation persists today as politicians rehearse old stereotypes to scapegoat and expel migrants. Once again charged as “criminal” and “invading armies,” a wide range of Asian groups face racialized deportation practices that deny them their rights and fracture families.

Consider Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Korean American student and lawful permanent U.S. resident. After she exercised her right to free speech while participating in student-led demonstrations at Columbia University, ICE moved to revoke Chung’s status and sought to deport her multiple times. Only when Chung sued the U.S. government to prevent her deportation did she gain a restraining order, blocking her removal.

Another innocent caught in this system is 6-year-old Yuanxin Zheng, a Chinese immigrant who arrived in New York City with his father in April. Even as they were following proper procedures to gain asylum, the family was forcibly separated by ICE on Nov. 26. Among the more than 2,600 children arrested this year by ICE, Yuanxin is one of the youngest. And although Yuanxin’s panic-stricken father was allowed a brief phone call with his son, he was left in the dark about his child’s whereabouts. ICE didn’t reunite the two until they were deported together, more than three weeks later.

Southeast Asian refugees also face a form of double jeopardy under the current administration’s policies. More than 15,000 Southeast Asians, many of whom served prison sentences for offenses committed in their youth, confront a second punishment: deportation orders.

For example, while serving 26 years in prison for murder, Phoeun You graduated from self-help programs, rebuilt his life and proved his commitment to change as he earned parole. Yet You never got to embrace his parents upon his release. Instead, he was immediately deported to Cambodia, a nation he never knew, and was permanently separated from his family. “I went from a life sentence to an eternal life sentence,” You told me when we spoke in February.

Last year, a survey by the Asian American Foundation reported that 63% of Asians now feel unsafe because of their race. ICE’s use of racial profiling and our nation’s xenophobic climate have undoubtedly contributed to these anxieties.

The five deaths of Asian nationals in ICE custody in 2025 are not just isolated tragedies. They reveal a system that has expanded faster than oversight can follow. Language barriers, delayed medical care and a lack of transparency inside detention centers have already had fatal consequences. This broken system does not make America safer but instead strikes fear throughout entire communities. ICE’s racial profiling and punitive enforcement practices do not bring about security but instead inflict lasting traumas on families and on generations like mine.

Ge’s passing demands justice — not only for his family, but for the end of for-profit prisons, of family separation and of the racist and violent enforcement of deportations. Each is a cruel and unusual punishment; together they constitute a morally bankrupt immigration system.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bbb1f49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5125x2691+0+364/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F77%2Fe2eb709f40bda3433b47319364cc%2F2237821829.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 23:57:17.166086

In a statement, the department said the states’ access to those funds would be restricted pending further review.
“Our states should not be political pawns in a fight that Donald Trump seems to have with blue state governors,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said, adding the step was “vindictive” and “cruel”.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and in social service programs.
Rights advocates say the Trump administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents more broadly.","Donald Trump’s administration is freezing more than $10bn in federal childcare and family assistance funds to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said, citing what it called concerns about fraud and misuse.

“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” Andrew Nixon, HHS spokesperson, said in a statement.

The Trump administration has threatened federal funding cuts to organizations and states over a number of issues since taking office – ranging from alleged fraud in programs of states governed by Democrats to diversity initiatives and pro-Palestinian university protests against US ally Israel’s assault on Gaza.

On Tuesday, HHS said it notified the five states, all with Democratic governors, that its freeze applied to the “Child Care and Development Fund” worth $2.4bn, the “Temporary Assistance for Needy Families” worth $7.35bn and the “Social Services Block Grant” worth $869m.

In a statement, the department said the states’ access to those funds would be restricted pending further review. The administration has not laid out details of either the fraud claims or the widening plan to withhold funds, which was first reported by the New York Post.

Democrats condemned the freeze. “Our states should not be political pawns in a fight that Donald Trump seems to have with blue state governors,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said, adding the step was “vindictive” and “cruel”.

Trump himself has not spoken on the specifics, but he proclaimed on social media Tuesday: “The Fraud Investigation of California has begun.”

In the fallout, HHS officials said no state will receive childcare funds without providing more verification. Several states told the Associated Press that they had not received any guidance on that decision.

Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for California governor Gavin Newsom, said in an email that “Donald Trump is a deranged, habitual liar whose relationship with reality ended years ago” and defended California’s record at stamping out fraud in government programs.

The senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said Trump’s move to halt funding aims to score political points, not to stop fraud.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and in social service programs.

Trump administration officials have frequently and sharply attacked the state’s Somali community, the largest in the country, as well as the Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, and the Democratic representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali American who represents a Minneapolis-based district in Congress.

Federal childcare funding has been put on hold in Minnesota since late last month amid investigations into a series of alleged fraud schemes at daycare centers run by people with family roots in Somalia.

Rights advocates say the Trump administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents more broadly.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fd97cad218febce3b2ccfc2971798be060addd/411_0_4815_3850/master/4815.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa69ee392a6fae374112c93d25baa6bc",N,,2026-01-06 22:56:19.531020

“You cannot rely on the article for one thing and not the other,” Judge Reyes said.
Lawyers representing the plaintiffs have also said that the government has sought to cast Haitian T.P.S.
If Judge Reyes pauses the revocation for Haitians, the government is likely to appeal, and the case could end up before the Supreme Court.
Early last year, Ms. Noem announced the end of T.P.S.","The Trump administration’s effort to revoke protections for 350,000 people from Haiti who fled their troubled homeland is facing what could be the last legal challenge before Temporary Protected Status for Haitians expires early next month.

Ending T.P.S. for Haitians was part of a wave of actions by the Department of Homeland Security last year as President Trump launched his campaign to carry out mass deportations and remake the U.S. immigration system.

T.P.S., which provides a shield against deportation for people from countries in the throes of a humanitarian crisis or armed conflict, has been a target of Trump officials, who say the program has become anything but temporary and no longer serves its intended purpose.

But revoking protections for Haitians, Venezuelans and people from several other countries has prompted more than a dozen legal challenges, including the case involving Haitians that is being heard this week in federal court in Washington, D.C.

Lawyers challenging the decision to end T.P.S. for Haitians have argued that the move was driven by politics and racial animus rather than by a required assessment of safety conditions in Haiti, where gangs have taken control of much of the capital since the 2021 assassination of the last elected president.

The lawyers have asked the judge in case, Ana C. Reyes of the Federal District Court, to put the revocation of T.P.S. for Haitians on hold while the lawsuit proceeds. Judge Reyes said on Tuesday that she expects to rule on that request by Feb. 2, the day before the status is scheduled to expire for Haitians.

During the hearing, Judge Reyes pressed government lawyers about whether the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, had adequately reviewed conditions in Haiti before terminating T.P.S.

The administration, which is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, has argued that ending T.P.S. for Haitians is in the national interest and that Secretary Noem is “unfettered by any statutory standard whatsoever.”

At the hearing on Tuesday, the judge focused on an email exchange that the administration cited as evidence that it had met its obligation to assess whether conditions in Haiti had improved sufficiently to justify ending the protection.

In the exchange, a homeland security official asked a State Department official for input on designation for Haiti T.P.S. According to the judge, the State Department official replied that the agency “believes there would be no foreign policy concerns.”

“That response does not address country conditions in Haiti,” Judge Reyes told one of the government lawyers, Dhruman Sampat.

The judge noted that the one-sentence reply from the State Department official had been sent just 53 minutes after the inquiry arrived on a Friday afternoon, and she suggested that the official could not have consulted experts or otherwise conducted a meaningful review.

In a back and forth that lasted more than 30 minutes, Mr. Sampat argued that the term “foreign policy” could reasonably be interpreted to encompass conditions on the ground. Judge Reyes was unconvinced. “This does not address whether it’s safe for Haitian T.P.S. holders to return to Haiti,” she said.

The named Haitian plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a registered nurse, a doctoral candidate researching Alzheimer’s disease, a woman adopted by Americans and a college student.

In a government notice, the Trump administration had cited a U.N. finding that there were “emerging signals of hope” in Haiti. But it did not refer to the U.N.’s assessments that Haiti was immersed in a “life and death emergency” and was going through one of five “highest concern” hunger crises in the world.

The judge faulted the government for “selectively” using the line from the report to justify not extending T.P.S., while ignoring a plethora of concerns about conditions in Haiti the U.N. had laid out.

“You cannot rely on the article for one thing and not the other,” Judge Reyes said.

Later in the hearing, the judge read aloud a statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in which he said that Haiti was facing “immediate security challenges.” The judge then asked the government lawyer if Mr. Rubio had been consulted about conditions in Haiti.

Lawyers representing the plaintiffs have also said that the government has sought to cast Haitian T.P.S. beneficiaries as criminals after identifying fewer than 900 out of 350,000 of the beneficiaries, or about .25 percent, as public safety threats.

“They are trying to fit the facts to their conclusion,” said Geoff Pipoly, a lead litigator for the plaintiffs. “Their entire process was informed by political considerations.”

T.P.S. was created by law 35 years ago to offer humanitarian protection to people from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disasters or other “extraordinary and temporary” conditions.

While the program allows recipients to live and work legally in the United States, it does not provide a pathway to permanent residency or citizenship.

Applicants must pass background checks, and those with a felony conviction or two or more misdemeanors cannot secure the status. Its holders can obtain driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers, but they are not eligible for most public benefits.

The Trump administration has moved aggressively to cancel T.P.S. from more than one million immigrants. People who lose the status become undocumented, lose their jobs and face deportation.

Economists have warned that shedding hundreds of thousands of workers by removing T.P.S. and carrying out mass deportations could disrupt could disrupt American businesses and cause prices of many goods and services to climb. Labor shortages in the hospitality, senior care and construction industries are all but certain.

Aline Gue, a Haitian community leader who attended the hearing, said, “Ending T.P.S. will not only break up our communities, it will result in the loss of billions of dollars for the U.S. economy.""

“It puts our Haitians in a position to be deported to a country where there is documented mass displacement, widespread gender-based violence and no recourse for justice,” she said.

If Judge Reyes pauses the revocation for Haitians, the government is likely to appeal, and the case could end up before the Supreme Court.

Early last year, Ms. Noem announced the end of T.P.S. for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had received it in 2023 and later ordered the termination of the status for another 250,000 Venezuelans granted protection in 2021.

Ms. Noem argued that conditions in Venezuela had improved and said recipients of the program were a burden on American taxpayers. She also claimed that members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan criminal gang, were among those benefiting from the designation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06nat-immig-tps-1-pvhl/06nat-immig-tps-1-pvhl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:12.434962

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.
Joe Lombardo, who is credited by Trump with helping lift him to victory in Nevada, did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s military action in the South American nation.","Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.

Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine.

Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried.

“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016.

Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”

Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’”

The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon.

On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”

Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”

In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America.

“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”

The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”

The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”

Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela.

Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”

Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.”

Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions.

Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela.

Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans.

Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”

Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army.

Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.

Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”

“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”

David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…”

He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela.

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.

“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as ""a war that's being waged against Minnesota.""

""You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,"" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

WATCH: Fraud scandals and Trump's rhetoric escalate fears in Minnesota's Somali community

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using ""questionable methods"" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was ""unlike any other day we've experienced.""

""It's incredibly distressing,"" Coleman said. ""What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.""

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

""We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,"" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for ""not meeting our standards and values"" when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

He also says ICE will reimburse agencies for overtime related to immigration enforcement.
RELATED: Texas troopers to enforce immigration laws under new federal partnership with ICE He plans to take the agreement to the Commissioners Court soon.","Texas counties with large populations are now on the clock.

Because of a January 1 deadline in Texas law, sheriffs of counties with more than 100,000 residents are required to formally partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the federal 287(g) program.

Counties have until the end of 2026 to sign on and implement one of three enforcement models.

While several major metro counties are still weighing their options, Bexar County has already signed on, becoming one of the first large urban areas in the state to do so.

Three Models, Different Levels of Authority

“By the end of this year, all of the counties with over 100,000 residents must enter into some type of agreement with ICE, but there are various levels,"" explained immigration attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch.

Under the task force model, officers can use enforcement power in routine work or while assisting an ICE-led task force.

The warrant service officer program allows local officers to serve and execute administrative warrants on migrants in local custody.

The jail enforcement model focuses on identifying and processing people eligible for removal who are already in county jails.

Bexar County chose the Warrant Service Officer Model.

Sheriff Javier Salazar says it was the most cost-effective option for taxpayers and allowed patrol deputies to operate as usual. Under the agreement, one deputy will be assigned to serve ICE warrants inside the county jail. That deputy is still waiting for ICE training.

“The vast majority of our community will not see any difference in how the sheriff's office does what we do,” Salazar said.

Salazar says he moved early to sign onto the program so his office could spend the year showing the community what participation will look like, and ensuring an agreement was in place in case the rule changed.

Lincoln-Goldfinch says the decision is not simple for many counties, especially those with large immigrant populations.

She says she's not surprised that major metro counties like Harris, Dallas, and Travis have not yet signed on, saying officials must balance compliance with state law and maintaining trust within their communities.

“When immigrants are afraid of sheriffs, they are not reporting being the victims of crime. They might avoid being witnesses to crime,” Lincoln-Goldfinch said.

Salazar says preventing that fear is a priority.

“We're going to come out and handle their case appropriately and not be conducting ourselves as if we're immigration agents,"" Salazar said.

Other Agencies Signing On Voluntarily

While some counties are still deciding, other law enforcement agencies are joining the program even though the law does not require them to.

Precinct 3 Constable Mark Vojvodich says his office agreed to the Task Force Model to formalize practices already in place.

“When we make arrests for a felony or a misdemeanor, and then if we run across somebody with an ICE detainer, we'd report that to them anyway, and this was a method we could use to add some other tools to our toolbox,"" he explained.

Vojvodich says none of his deputy constables will be dedicated specifically to ICE, but they will be able to assist if requested. He also says ICE will reimburse agencies for overtime related to immigration enforcement.

“Once it becomes an ICE issue, like we're waiting 45 minutes for ICE to arrive, they will actually compensate us on an overtime basis and pay back Bexar County taxpayers,"" Vojvodich says.

Those reimbursements, he says, can help offset other budget pressures.

“The day-to-day operation for a constable won't really change,"" Vojvodich assures the community.

RELATED: Texas troopers to enforce immigration laws under new federal partnership with ICE

He plans to take the agreement to the Commissioners Court soon.

Balcones Heights has also signed onto the program, telling the I-Team its decision is about public safety, not politics.

Mayor Johnny Rodriguez sent this statement following the city's December vote:

The Mayor and City Council set the goals and objectives for the City of Balcones Heights. It is then the responsibility of the City Administrator and the Chief of Police to operationalize those goals through professional judgement and day-to-day management.

Our goal is clear and unchanged: to make Balcones Heights the safest suburban city in Bexar County. The decision to enter a 287 (g) agreement authorized by Congress since 1996 was made by our professional leadership as an operational tool to advance that goal. This was not a political statement, but a judgement call by those responsible for public safety. We respect that chain of responsibility and place our trust in our professionals to act lawfully, effectively, and in the best interest of our residents

Potential Legal Consequences

Counties that do not participate by the end-of-year deadline could face legal action from the Texas Attorney General. Senate Bill 8 gives the AG the authority to take noncompliant jurisdictions to court.

The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

The governor's office is urging compliance with the program.

Until DHS can provide transparency and assurance that these operations are conducted lawfully and effectively, similar enforcement actions should be suspended.”","WASHINGTON — Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem raising serious concerns about how DHS conducted Operation Midway Blitz in Illinois, including in his district, warning that the operation appears to have swept up large numbers of individuals without criminal convictions and produced deadly consequences.

The Congressman writes:

“DHS has said this operation focused on dangerous criminals, but the facts suggest that many people with no criminal convictions were arrested instead. During my oversight visit, I learned that individuals were targeted and held not because they had been convicted of a crime, but merely because they had been charged with an offense in the past.”

He further notes that public reporting contradicts DHS’s stated priorities:

“While DHS has stated that roughly 4,500 people were detained during Operation Midway Blitz, reports show that only about 15 percent of those detained had prior criminal convictions. When enforcement actions primarily affect people without criminal convictions, it undermines DHS’s stated focus on targeting the most dangerous individuals.”

The letter also highlights the death of Nenko Gantchev, who died in DHS custody after being arrested when he voluntarily appeared for a scheduled immigration interview.

“He was not detained because of a criminal conviction,” Krishnamoorthi writes, “but because of enforcement practices that prioritized increasing the number of immigrants detained rather than focusing on genuine public safety threats. His case underscores the human cost of enforcement actions that do not center on individuals with criminal convictions.”

To ensure accountability, Congressman Krishnamoorthi requests written responses from DHS by January 15, 2026, to the following questions:

How many people detained during Operation Midway Blitz had criminal convictions?

How many detainees with no prior criminal convictions were charged with a crime by DHS at the time of their arrest?

Please provide body-camera footage for any arrests of individuals without prior convictions or active charges.

To which facilities were individuals detained in Illinois transferred, and how many of those transferred experienced serious health deterioration while in DHS custody?

How will DHS ensure that future enforcement actions target individuals with serious criminal convictions or active warrants?

The Congressman concludes:

“Immigration enforcement should focus on individuals who pose real public safety risks, not on families, workers, or bystanders caught in a dragnet. Until DHS can provide transparency and assurance that these operations are conducted lawfully and effectively, similar enforcement actions should be suspended.”",https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:20.950790

Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith acted unlawfully when making two key appointments to New Zealand’s human rights watchdog, the High Court has ruled, in a decision that is likely to curb ministerial discretion when filling sensitive public service roles.

The court found Goldsmith failed to follow proper procedure when appointing Chief Human Rights Commissioner Stephen Rainbow and Race Relations Commissioner Melissa Derby in 2024.

“The decision was unlawful because: (a) the minister applied the incorrect legal test; and (b) the minister failed to take into account relevant considerations,” Justice David Gendall found in a decision published late last month.

While the ruling is embarrassing for Goldsmith – the minister charged with overseeing the justice system – it does not make the appointments of Rainbow and Derby to the Human Rights Commission invalid.

While the court heard evidence that neither candidate received backing from a four-person panel of experts set up to consider the appointments, Gendall said each still met many of the criteria required for their roles.

“I do not consider the fact that the minister departed from the recommendations of the panel here rendered his decision unreasonable… the minister was not bound to follow their recommendations, and it was open to him to place different weight on the various criteria,” he said.

‘Errors’ in appointment

The application for judicial review was brought by Paul Thistoll, chief executive of campaign group Rights Aotearoa, in his capacity as a private citizen.

Thistoll said he wanted to ensure the appointments followed “a lawful, robust process that respects the statutory criteria set by Parliament”.

“The court has confirmed that the minister cannot simply bypass the legal requirements of the Crown Entities Act and the Human Rights Act,” he said in a statement.

“While the minister has discretion, he must apply the correct legal tests and genuinely weigh the mandatory considerations.”

Thistoll initially wanted the appointments of Rainbow and Derby to be overturned, but later dropped this from his application, which Gendall said was the correct course of action.

But the judge disagreed with counsel for Goldsmith, who argued that declaring the appointments unlawful but not invalid would be “futile” and have no practical value.

“I agree with the applicant [Thistoll], that the declaration sought here would serve a real purpose in ensuring that future recommendations for the position of human rights commissioners proceed lawfully,” he said.

“When potential appointees for such positions occupy an important public office intended to help ensure the human rights of New Zealanders are upheld and promoted, there is a clear and substantial public interest in having errors in their appointment publicly declared.”

Unlawfulness ‘rests with the minister’

The court heard that neither Rainbow nor Derby was on the initial shortlists of candidates drawn up by the appointment panel. The panel comprised former solicitor general and Supreme Court justice Sir Terence Arnold, former Attorney-General Chris Finlayson KC, barrister Paul Rishworth KC and Māori advocate Lorraine Toki.

Once interviews were completed, the panel did not recommend Rainbow, noting he was “less commanding than other leading candidates” when responding the questions about legal matters.

After Derby’s interview, the panel’s assessment was that she “lacked depth and experience, and that she would find the role very challenging”.

Thistoll’s counsel told the court that there were concerns that ACT Party leader David Seymour had spoken with Goldsmith directly about Rainbow’s candidacy after learning his application had not been successful.

Both Rainbow and Derby were subsequently appointed to their respective roles and commenced work in November 2024.

While they were not the appointment panel’s preferred picks, Gendall said the experts noted both candidates had qualities suitable for their roles.

For Rainbow, these included “excellent communication skills, his ability to build bridges across the political divide, and his prior experience as an advocate for LGBT rights”.

Derby was described as having first-rate intellectual ability, an approachable personality, a sound knowledge of human rights and social issues, Te Tiriti o Waitangi dimensions and an understanding of the rights of indigenous peoples.

Gendall pointed out that Rainbow and Derby had done nothing wrong or unlawful themselves, saying “the unlawfulness rests with the minister in making his decision, in which they had no involvement”.

The deployment, which began over the weekend, represents one of the largest single-city mobilizations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in years, according to a person briefed on the operation. The surge dramatically expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota amid heightened political and community tensions.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said during an interview with Newsmax that the agency was carrying out its “largest immigration operation ever,” though he did not specify how many officers were involved.

Roughly three-quarters of the personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, the person said. The operation also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks. HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and accompanied ICE officers during at least one arrest. In a video posted on the social media platform X, Noem is seen wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrest a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the man, whose hands are cuffed behind his back, “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the man arrested was from Ecuador and that he was wanted in Ecuador and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault.

When asked how many officers and agents had been deployed to Minnesota, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin declined to provide a figure, citing officer safety. She said DHS had surged law enforcement resources to the state and had already made more than 1,000 arrests of people it described as killers, rapists, child sexual offenders and gang members.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Commander Gregory Bovino, whose role in previous federal operations in other cities has drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates, the person familiar with the deployment said.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in support of the Trump administration’s lawsuit to shut down Texas’s law granting in-state tuition to illegal aliens who live in the state.

Not only does Texas let illegal aliens attend its public universities, but it lets illegals who meet a three-year state residency requirement pay only in-state tuition, while charging American citizens from out of state much higher tuition.

Congress has passed a law against this practice, giving Americans from any state an entitlement to pay the same in-state tuition to another state’s public universities as illegal aliens who live in that state pay based on their residence.

True, the Supreme Court has held that laws passed by Congress that tell states what laws they may or may not pass are instances of unconstitutional “commandeering” of states. But, as FAIR shows in its brief, if a law of Congress can be read to establish a federal right to engage in certain activity—here, pay the same instate tuition that illegal aliens are allowed to pay based on their residence—that law overrides and preempts any state law that violates that right.

“For Texas, it’s not enough to let illegal aliens—who are not permitted to live in the United States at all—into its state schools, and apply lower admission standards to instate illegal aliens than to out-of-state Americans,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “Even after all that, Texas also lets them pay much less in tuition than the out-of-state Americans have to pay. That’s where federal law and its supremacy come in, however. We hope the court sees that Congress’s law against this practice in clearly constitutional, and rules for the United States.”

Tammy Verhas said Monday her room was entered about 6:45 a.m. by three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who grabbed and cuffed her husband, Jose Martinez, and detained him in a detention facility. Both are U.S. citizens.

“We were in bed asleep and all of a sudden flashlights were going all over the place and three men came in and grabbed Jose,” Verhas said. “I was trying to film the whole thing, and they brought in a woman to try and keep me from filming, but I was able to shove her off of me.”

Carnival Cruises declined to comment on the incident citing a policy regarding individual guests, and officials with ICE in the Phoenix area were checking on the incident with counterparts in Miami.

While at the detention facility, Martinez was told has his name had come up with warrants for being a violent offender. It was later found that the Martinez they were looking for was not him, and he was released from the detention center and reunited with Verhas off ship by cruise security.

“They gave me no reason, and that name association was their justification,” Martinez said. “I gave all my documented information to Carnival. I should have known before getting on the ship that my name would have been flagged for any issues.

“I was treated like a criminal right from the start,” Martinez added. “I have never been in this type of situation before. I was traumatized.”

Verhas had her phone taken away for a time because of the video she had taken of the incident. ICE told her she would only receive her phone back if she deleted the video she had taken. Verhas complied and her phone was returned to her.

“I was told ‘This is how we do it.’” Verhas said. “I was traumatized by the whole situation.”

Verhas said there have been issues in the past with her husband’s name being flagged.

“This isn’t the first time we have had issues with being stopped,” Verhas said. “We’ve been pulled out of line a number of times with TSA, and all those times we have complied without any issues.”

Verhas and Martinez are not sure what steps they will take next.

“We’re not sure if we are pursuing litigation,” Martinez said. “I’m still coming down from the shock.

“We’re reaching out to Carnival corporate to see what can be done,” Martinez added.

He shared the news on Tuesday during an interview with Newsmax.

""We have the largest immigration operation ever taking place right now,"" Lyons told the media outlet. ""It is a great effort by ICE.""

Lyons added that ICE, as well as agents with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS ) have been going ""door-to-door"" to visit companies that were accused of hiring illegal immigrants, as well as businesses that are potentially involved in human trafficking and recent fraud cases.

""States like Minnesota that have a strong sanctuary city policy and sanctuary protections do attract other illegal aliens to come there to take advantage of welfare, public assistance, SNAP benefits,"" he told Newsmax. ""And that's just a magnet that brings a criminal element that can hide in plain sight -- and that's what we're finding up in Minnesota.""

Lyons said (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem was in Minnesota during the operation, adding that agents arrested multiple suspects.

""She ran an awesome, successful operation,"" he said, ""[She] got a suspected murderer and a wanted rapist that was hiding, again, in plain sight in Minneapolis,"" Lyons said. ""And that's what ICE agents are doing on the ground up there.""

DHS shared a clip of the interview and shared it on social media.

""Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS law enforcement is surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS noted on X.

The news comes amid fraud claims in Minnesota.

FBI director Kash Patel last week said he already ""surged personnel and investigative resources"" to the city to dismantle ""large-scale fraud schemes"" exploiting federal programs. The cases allegedly involved members of the area's Somali immigrant community.

""Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,"" Patel previously wrote on X, noting that the FBI uncovered and dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Patel said the investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. He also said the case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions so far.

""The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,"" Patel added. ""We will continue to follow the money and protect children.""

It also follows allegations made in a 42-minute video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In the footage, Shirley visited what appeared to be empty daycare centers, mostly run by members of the Somali community, which receive millions of dollars in taxpayer money.

At one point, he attempted to confront daycare staff members. The video shows a woman yelling, ""Don't open up. It's ICE."" She also tells Shirley and his team to ""go away.""

Shirley asks the woman how she feels about the fraud that's taking place in Minnesota, but she continues to holler.

""Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one,"" Shirley wrote on X, adding that no children were present at the center. ""In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.""

Walz has since announced he won't be seeking re-election.

Zarazua said ICE agents tried to intimidate her into coaxing her boyfriend out, but she refused and demanded to see a judicial warrant.
“I told them they need an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge to do this,” she said.","A man who fled federal immigration agents and took refuge in a Bloomington office building, where the agents were refused entry, was ultimately arrested Tuesday following an hours-long standoff.

The man was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents near the Walmart in Bloomington while driving to work, said his girlfriend, Michelle Zarazua. He then fled on foot and ran into the Wilderness Inquiry building, a nearby outdoors travel company, shortly before 9 a.m., the company’s employees told Sahan Journal.

“He called me and he told me that he was in this building because he was scared and he didn’t know what to do,” Zarazua said. “So I came from my job and tried to help.”

The arrest comes days after more immigration officers were reportedly sent to Minnesota in a surge of enforcement that continues the work of Operation Metro Surge that began in December. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was seen taking part in an early morning raid in St. Paul on Tuesday amid the expanded enforcement efforts.

Wilderness Inquiry said in a written statement that the man came into their building in distress as ICE was attempting to apprehend him. The company’s staff let the man stay in their vestibule where he was visible to ICE agents, but did not let agents in the building as they consulted their legal counsel about what to do.

What followed was a back-and-forth through an interpreter between the man, who was inside the office, and immigration agents and Bloomington police, who were outside.

“I am proud of the Wilderness Inquiry team, who showed composure and compassion during a very difficult situation today,” Wilderness Inquiry’s Executive Director Erika Rivers said in the statement.

ICE agents can make arrests in public spaces without a warrant signed by a judge, but need a judicial warrant in order to gain entry and make arrests in private spaces like homes and businesses.

Reached for comment, ICE declined to provide details about the incident or detainee. Bloomington police declined to comment on the arrest, and said their involvement was “limited to helping maintain the peace and ensure the safety of all individuals involved.”

More than two dozen bystanders watched the incident unfold. Zarazua said ICE agents tried to intimidate her into coaxing her boyfriend out, but she refused and demanded to see a judicial warrant.

“I told them they need an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge to do this,” she said. “And they said, ‘No, I don’t need that, I’m going to arrest him no matter what.’”

Law enforcement ultimately presented a felony arrest warrant about two hours after the man arrived at the building, prompting him to voluntarily surrender.

Reports of ICE activity in the Twin Cities proliferated across social media Tuesday. Several videos showed the arrest of an Ecuadorian man in St. Paul, where Noem was present.

John Larson as ally in fight against Trump - CT Mirror,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/william-tong-endorses-john-larson-as-ally-in-fight-against-trump/,"U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.
“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about.
Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here.
He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said.
“That’s why I’m supporting John Larson.","U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.

The chosen venue for the Tuesday morning press conference was the community center named for his late mother, Lois Nolan Larson, at Mayberry Village, the one-time federal housing project in East Hartford that has been a blue-collar touchstone for Larson through his nearly 50 years in public life, the last 27 as a congressman.

Tong, the first of the state’s six statewide constitutional officers to take sides in the rare intra-party challenge to a Connecticut congressional incumbent, said he and Larson share modest beginnings that shape their politics and fuel their opposition to a president the attorney general has sued 45 times this year.

“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about. I don’t have to guess what this campaign is about. It’s about the people that live here,” said Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants. “It’s about the people that fight for every inch, every single day.”

Larson, 77, who has not had a Democratic primary since winning the open seat in 1998, is facing a challenge from former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune.

Tong’s repeated references to Mayberry Village and Larson’s upbringing in a public housing seemed calculated to draw a contrast with Bronin, who grew up in Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich, and is by far the best funded of the three challengers.

Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here. He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said. “That’s why I’m supporting John Larson. The other reason why I’m supporting John Larson is because in our official roles, we are on the front lines of this fight against a president and the federal government that every day seeks to do us harm.”

Tong’s endorsement was expected. He had joined Larson in September in opposing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants and speaking out against the Department of Homeland Security targeting the congressman over his harsh criticism of the tactics employed by DHE’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Larson had compared masked ICE agents to the SS and Gestapo of Nazi Germany.

On Tuesday, Larson accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of lying to Congress when he assured members that the Trump administration was not working for regime change in Venezuela, not long before U.S. commandos seized its president, Nicolas Maduro, snubbing congressional leaders who should have been consulted.

“How about respect for the law, the Constitution and the War Powers Act?” Larson said.

He offered sarcastic praise for the president on one count.

“At least he was honest about this: It’s about the oil. It’s about the oil and taking over those refineries,” Larson said. “And by the way, who’s going to defend those refineries and the American corporations that go there? And who’s going to defend that pipeline? United States military. This president and his administration need to come before Congress.”

Larson said Democrats need more than criticism of Trump and pivoted to a favorite topic: the preservation of Social Security. He faulted Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden quit the race, for failing to talk about issues other than Trump’s fitness.

“I begged the Harris administration to talk about Social Security, to put it out there, and we didn’t. We talked about Donald Trump, and as bad as he is, if you don’t have a plan, you’re not going to be successful. And we will have a plan, and you’ll hear about it in more detail.”

Larson said he is working with two other members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal of Massachusetts and Mike Thompson of California, on legislation addressing student debt and the difficulty in renters becoming homeowners.

“We’re going to be back to the new New Deal,” Larson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9382-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-06 16:58:10.201062

Since Inauguration Day, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive revocation of legal immigration.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela — make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021, memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting in late November in Washington, D.C. — tied to an Afghan national granted asylum — the program is under increased scrutiny, and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’ ” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status, they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.

Venezuela has been considered non-cooperative with deportation flights, accepting a limited number of deportees.","Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are being encouraged to go home or face deportation following the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Why it matters: Venezuelan immigrants had temporary U.S. legal protections until last year, in part due to poor economic conditions and human rights abuses under the Maduro government.

""President Trump's decisive action to remove Maduro marks a turning point for Venezuelans. Now, they can return to the country they love and rebuild its future,"" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser in a statement.

Zoom in: A Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation in 2023 gave about 348,000 Venezuelans legal status and the opportunity for work permits. The Trump administration terminated that status in April.

Another TPS designation from 2021 gave roughly 268,000 Venezuelans protection and was terminated in November.

Many more Venezuelans live and work in the U.S. with visas or could apply for permanent legal status (like a green card).

Between the lines: Venezuela is ""more free today than it was yesterday,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Sunday, the day after the Maduro raid became public.

Noem said TPS holders can apply for ""refugee status.""

But asylum isn't currently an option. A December policy memo from USCIS ordered a pause on all asylum applications.

Venezuelans are also affected by the Trump administration's pause on all immigration decisions because Venezuela is on the travel ban list.

USCIS did not respond when asked whether there are any changes to process applications from Venezuelans.

The bottom line: Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) said Monday, after an unannounced ICE detention oversight visit, that there are now plans to ramp up deportation flights.

""A supervisor told me that in light of the abduction of Nicolás Maduro this past weekend that the Department of Homeland Security is going to be taking another look at the possibility of deporting Venezuelans back to Venezuela,"" he said.

Venezuela has been considered non-cooperative with deportation flights, accepting a limited number of deportees. Many deported Venezuelans had been sent to other countries, including Mexico, to facilitate faster removals.

Following preliminary approval, two law firms appointed as class counsel and three additional non-appointed firms filed a petition for fees to be awarded in connection with the class action settlement.
As to the three non-appointed law firms, the Court found that they ""cannot appoint [themselves] class counsel by showing up.
Furthermore, the class notice ""never alerted class members that still other lawyers would come out of the woodwork to seek a third again whatever their class counsel would seek for its work.""
It offers strong precedent for any company defending a large class action and preparing to enter into a class action settlement.","Duane Morris Takeaways: On December 23, 2025, Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered an order in Bartz, et al. v. Anthropic PBC, Case No. 24-CV-5417 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2025), requiring five law firms seeking a fee award in connection with a class action settlement to file a declaration setting forth the full extent of any of the firms' actual or proposed fee-sharing agreements and the extent to which any arrangement may result in some class members receiving a sweeter recovery than other class members. Judge Alsup also ordered preservation of all communications and other documents relating to such side deals.

The ruling is significant because it shows that only appointed class counsel may be eligible to receive a fee award in connection with a class action settlement, and may not outsource its responsibilities to non-appointed counsel or seek any other arrangements that may favor some class members to the detriment of other class members. Furthermore, the ruling shows that any such side deals must be disclosed publicly prior to any final approval of a class action settlement.

Many of these gen AI class actions are ""bet-the-company"" lawsuits, even for the world's largest companies. Plaintiffs in gen AI class actions typically invoke the Copyright Act in order to seek millions — and sometimes even billions — of dollars on the theory that thousands or millions of unauthorized copies of copyrighted works, times up to $150,000 per copyrighted work for willful infringement, equals a crushing, settlement-inspiring number.

InBartz, the parties reached a $1.5 billion settlement, which the Court preliminary approved, and which we blogged about previously here and here.

Following preliminary approval, two law firms appointed as class counsel and three additional non-appointed firms filed a petition for fees to be awarded in connection with the class action settlement. The fee petition sought $225 million for class counsel and $75 million for the non-appointed law firms. Id. at 3, 7. These three non-appointed firms had agreed to gather contact information for the class list and to provide input on the claim form and claims process, two for the publisher class members (""Publishers' Coordination Counsel""), and one for the author class members (""Authors' Coordination Counsel""). Id. at 3.

The Court's Decision

The Court declined to rule on the fee petition, ordering that a number of disclosures and preservation efforts be made first in order ""to set the record straight"" concerning aspects of the fee petition. Id. at 1. Such was necessary, according to the Court, because it appeared that counsel may have entered into one or more ""side deals."" Id. at 3.

As the Court explained, ""[t]wo and only two law firms were ever appointed class counsel."" Id. at 1. Moreover, ""preliminary approval and the class notices confirmed that only two firms were approved to serve the class ... Those firms never proposed a fee splitting scheme, and none was ever even preliminarily approved."" Id. at 7.

As to the three non-appointed law firms, the Court found that they ""cannot appoint [themselves] class counsel by showing up. Nor can class counsel appoint someone else to do its work."" Id. at 2. As the Court further explained, it had not had a chance to vet the non-appointed counsel for conflicts, or to prevent duplication of effort by overlapping law firms. Id. at 8. In addition, the Court found it concerning that ""we do not yet know whether 'Publishers' Coordination Counsel' will share any part of their bonanza with one or more publishers so as to give those publishers a premium to not opt out ... and thereby avoid triggering [the defendant]'s right to about the settlement."" Id. Furthermore, the class notice ""never alerted class members that still other lawyers would come out of the woodwork to seek a third again whatever their class counsel would seek for its work."" Id. (emphasis added).

For these reasons, the Court ordered that, within one week, all law firms who filed fee petitions or on whose behalf fee petitions were filed, must publicly file a declaration (not under seal) setting forth the ""full extent"" to which such firm agreed or made a proposal ""to share any portion(s) of any fee award in this class action or in any other class action (putative or certified) involving any party (or class member) herein,"" and stating as to each such agreement or proposal its date, terms, the extent to which it is verbal and the extent to which it is in writing (or in an email or text or other message), and the parties and the names of all persons who made the agreement. Id. at 10. The Court also ordered public disclosure in a declaration of the ""full extent to which any arrangement has been made or proposed by which any class member would receive a sweeter recovery than other class members."" Id. at 10-11. Finally, the Court further ordered that ""[a]ll emails, messages, and written materials relating to any of the above shall be preserved for future potential discovery."" Id. at 11.

Implications For Companies

The Bartz fee petition order is as extraordinary as it is unique. It offers strong precedent for any company defending a large class action and preparing to enter into a class action settlement. Specifically, Bartz shows that plaintiffs' firms seeking any portion of a fee award in connection with such a settlement will need to publicly disclose any side deals prior to any final settlement approval. Therefore, settling defendants should consider seeking to discover any side-deal information before entering into such settlement. That way, any obstacles to final settlement approval such as that presented by the Bartz fee petition order might be considered before the parties reach any settlement.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/profile/companythumb/21358.webp?v=20241101122045,N,,2026-01-06 18:58:55.595498

DHS shared a clip of the interview and shared it on social media.

""Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS law enforcement is surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS noted on X.

The news comes amid fraud claims in Minnesota.

FBI director Kash Patel last week said he already ""surged personnel and investigative resources"" to the city to dismantle ""large-scale fraud schemes"" exploiting federal programs. The cases allegedly involved members of the area's Somali immigrant community.

""Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,"" Patel previously wrote on X, noting that the FBI uncovered and dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Patel said the investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. He also said the case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions so far.

""The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,"" Patel added. ""We will continue to follow the money and protect children.""

It also follows allegations made in a 42-minute video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In the footage, Shirley visited what appeared to be empty daycare centers, mostly run by members of the Somali community, which receive millions of dollars in taxpayer money.

At one point, he attempted to confront daycare staff members. The video shows a woman yelling, ""Don't open up. It's ICE."" She also tells Shirley and his team to ""go away.""

Shirley asks the woman how she feels about the fraud that's taking place in Minnesota, but she continues to holler.

""Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one,"" Shirley wrote on X, adding that no children were present at the center. ""In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.""

Walz has since announced he won't be seeking re-election.

ICE in Minnesota

What we know:

Activists and city leaders have noted increased ICE activity in Minneapolis on Tuesday. In posts on social media platform Bluesky, Minneapolis City Council member Jason Chavez warned of immigration officers checking Latino residents' status.

In his post, Chavez writes: ""Activity is really hot this morning on Lake Street and Powderhorn. There’s also confirmed ICE vehicles using Uber stickers. Please be careful.""

The backstory:

The Trump administration is reportedly sending upwards of 2,100 ICE agents and Department of Homeland Security investigators into the Twin Cities for the new operation. The basis for the new operation is to take on fraud in the Twin Cities, according to reports.

Sec. Noem in St. Paul

Local perspective:

The Department of Homeland Security also shared videos Tuesday morning of Sec. Kristi Noem assisting agents in the arrest in St. Paul of an Ecuadorian national who they say was wanted for murder.

In the video, agents are seen moving into an apartment near the Payne Market off Payne Avenue near Jenks Avenue East on Tuesday.

What they're saying:

In a post on X, Noem wrote: ""Another murderer and sexual predator off of Minneapolis’s streets thanks to @ICEgov. Just arrested this criminal illegal alien from Ecuador who has an active warrant for murder and sexual assault in Ecuador. He was convicted of robbery and extortion in Ecuador.""

Local perspective:

Tuesday morning, protesters gathered outside the Whipple Building at Fort Snelling, where immigration court takes place, as part of an ""emergency protest.""

The massive 30-day surge began on Sunday with roughly 1,000 additional agents deployed to Minneapolis and St. Paul, including from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a person familiar with the plans told MS NOW. Agents who were already on the ground are expected to have their deployment extended, the person said.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed the deployment to MS NOW but did not provide details on the number of agents on the ground.

The fraud allegations were fueled by a viral video from 23-year-old conservative content creator, Nick Shirley, that alleged Somali-run day cares were receiving federal subsidies without actually providing child care. In the 43-minute video, Shirley visits what he says are fake day care centers. But the evidence for his allegations are unsubtantiated. The director of one of the facilities told a local news station that Shirley had arrived at the center with a team of people, some masked, causing fear.

Still, the video was spread by top officials in the Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel.

President Donald Trump has often attributed the alleged fraud to the state’s Somali immigrant population. Late last year, ICE carried out an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis aimed at people who had received deportation orders, including immigrants from Somalia. As of mid-December, at least 400 immigrants were detained, according to DHS.

Minneapolis is among a growing list of cities targeted by the Trump administration in a nationwide crackdown on crime and immigration. In recent months, agents and National Guard troops have been sent to cities including Washington, D.C., and Memphis. States and cities have filed lawsuits over the actions.

Recommended

In a rare reversal last week, Trump announced he is pulling National Guard troops out of Chicago; Los Angeles; and Portland, Oregon.

The move substantially expands federal law enforcement’s presence in Minnesota amid rising political and community tensions. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced on Monday that he is suspending his campaign for a third term as his administration faces scrutiny over the fraud allegations. DHS recently paused federal child care payments to the state and announced last week that the suspension would be expanded nationwide pending a fraud investigation.

On Monday, ICE posted an email appearing to be from a Hilton hotel that said reservations for DHS and ICE agents had been canceled. A statement from Hilton said the hotel in the email is “independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values.” The company added that it is “investigating this matter with this individual hotel.”

Following Maduro’s capture, Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called on the Trump Administration to reinstate TPS for Venezuelans.
In mid-December, the Venezuelan government claimed that the U.S. had suspended deportation flights to Venezuela, a claim denied by Washington.
Following Maduro’s capture, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to EL PAÍS that the flights are not suspended.","The capture of Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces has opened a new chapter of uncertainty for many Venezuelan exiles in the United States, for whom the lack of clarity regarding a democratic transition and the possibility of further military action are dampening any thought of returning to their country. This ambiguity is compounded for hundreds of thousands of people who are in limbo after the Trump administration canceled temporary immigration protections, as well as for asylum seekers who fear their cases will be affected by the changing circumstances in Venezuela.

“In the last 48 hours, the community has been in complete panic,” says John De La Vega, a Venezuelan lawyer in Miami who says he has received calls from “hundreds of people” worried about their immigration cases since news broke that a commando unit had captured Maduro in a surprise attack last weekend. “The main uncertainty is: If Maduro has been captured, will my asylum case fall apart? Will the government stop approving asylum cases because of this situation?” says De La Vega.

On the other hand, for many, the news revived hopes that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela would be restored after the Trump administration canceled it last year, leaving more than 600,000 Venezuelans in immigration limbo, many of them residents of South Florida, the lawyer added.

This decision was compounded by the cancellation of the humanitarian parole program that had allowed more than 100,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the United States for a period of two years.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were indicted in the Southern District of New York on narcoterrorism charges. Trump has stated that the U.S. will run the country: “We’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.” He also asserted that the U.S. military is “prepared to do a second wave” of attacks, although “we probably won’t have to do it.”

But the situation inside Venezuela remains uncertain. Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assumed the interim presidency, but it is unclear who effectively controls the military and security structures that sustained Chavismo for more than two decades. Key regime figures, such as Diosdado Cabello, considered the number two in Chavismo, and high-ranking military officers continue to operate within the country, fueling fears of reprisals and a further narrowing of political space.

Among the diaspora, many believe that the conditions that forced them to flee remain in place, and the country’s immediate future remains uncertain.

One person who lost her TPS status and doesn’t see returning as an option is Rossaly Nava, a 43-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years. Nava, originally from Maracaibo, was involved with the opposition and had to flee the Chavista regime. Her former boss, a member of parliament, remains detained in Venezuela on charges of treason and other offenses. “This doesn’t guarantee that I can return,” she says. “Maduro isn’t looking for me, but there are those directly responsible, like Diosdado Cabello and his torturers, who know perfectly well who I am. I can’t return until I’m certain that those who attacked me won’t be there.”

When she had TPS, “I was protected,” she explains, but today she only has an asylum process that began 10 years ago. “I consider myself at risk of being returned to a country that is not ready to protect those of us who were linked to the opposition,” she adds.

On Saturday, a crowd in Doral, the Miami-Dade city with the largest Venezuelan diaspora in the country, where many backed Trump in the hope that he would remove Maduro from power, celebrated the latter’s capture. That enthusiasm, however, has given way to discontent following the end of immigration protections, amid an anti-immigrant offensive that has sown fear in the community.

Following Maduro’s capture, Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called on the Trump Administration to reinstate TPS for Venezuelans. But that hope was dashed on Sunday when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem—who canceled TPS for Venezuela four months ago, claiming it was contrary to the national interest—stated that the country is “more free than it was yesterday” and that those who lost TPS could apply for asylum instead.

“That only confused the community even more,” says Helen Villalonga, president of Amavex, a human rights organization, who says that “many people have contacted her” seeking clarification because “they believe they can now apply for asylum, but asylum is not requested from within the United States.”

Furthermore, Villalonga maintains that Venezuelans need protection now more than ever. “Before, we didn’t have an invasion; now we do.”

The confusion also extends to the subject of deportations. In mid-December, the Venezuelan government claimed that the U.S. had suspended deportation flights to Venezuela, a claim denied by Washington. Following Maduro’s capture, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to EL PAÍS that the flights are not suspended.

Patricia Andrade, founder of Venezuela Awareness, warns about the deportations, saying, “You can’t send people to a country that remains unstable, where orders have been given to imprison those who support Trump’s actions.” She says her contacts in Venezuela describe an apparent normalcy, but that “there is a lot of fear” among the population, that paramilitary groups are in the streets, and that Chavistas are “shoring up the few followers they have left.”

Last month, the Trump Administration suspended immigration processing for citizens of a list of countries that includes Venezuela. However, De La Vega, the lawyer, clarifies that asylum has not been eliminated, but rather that “what is suspended is the decision-making process, the government’s approval or denial of cases.” Nevertheless, he warns that the situation is extremely volatile. “We have to wait. The situation in Venezuela is going to change day by day, almost hour by hour.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/WAA3IQMQ2RHNTMENZUEL65AMD4.jpg?auth=f490e3d9bb8839ef5a3e86ee2e43f97934c59ab3c9874000bc7195dbbf1f8a64&width=1200,N,,2026-01-06 15:57:16.607631

Quotations from affidavits and forensic examinations of MPP asylum seekers were reviewed and grouped into predefined trauma categories.
Major themes included physical and sexual violence, violence directed toward family or friends, police violence, gang violence, extortion, forced labor, and robbery.
This finding aligns with recent studies showing younger age distributions among asylum seekers in the US.20 Several factors may explain this finding.
These findings highlight the importance of considering the health and safety of asylum seekers in the design of asylum policies.","Introduction

Asylum seekers are individuals who apply for international protection due to fears of persecution or violence in their home countries.1 In 2024, the United Nations estimated that 123.2 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or other events disturbing public order.2 Among these displaced individuals, many sought asylum in countries with established protective programs, such as the US, where pending asylum cases exceeded 2.2 million in 2025.3

This unprecedented increase in asylum cases has coincided with increasingly restrictive US border policies. Citing border security concerns, the US implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in January 2019, requiring asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border to remain in Mexico while awaiting hearings. The MPP marked a shift from international norms, which traditionally permitted asylum seekers residence in the host country during case processing. Individuals subjected to the MPP reported being returned to border towns where they faced dangers including threats of violence and kidnapping, forced family separation, and unstable living conditions, including living in overcrowded tent cities without access to running water or electricity.4 Objective systematic data on trauma in this population are limited, although nongovernmental organizations such as Human Rights First and Amnesty International estimate the number of violent attacks on individuals subjected to the MPP to be over 13 000, with the true number likely higher due to underreporting.5,6

Due to these concerns, the MPP remained subject to legal and policy challenges and was suspended temporarily in January 2021, formally halted after a Supreme Court ruling in June 2022, and reinstated again by the US Department of Homeland Security in January 2025.7 In parallel, other policies such as Title 42 expulsions based on public health safety with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent asylum transit bans limiting asylum applications for individuals who had already traversed multiple countries similarly restricted access at the US southern border, showing a broader transition in the US asylum landscape toward more restrictive migration policies.8,9

Such measures not only limited access to asylum but also placed asylum seekers, a group already fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries, into unstable environments associated with a heightened risk of trauma. Global research has consistently documented high rates of trauma-related conditions among asylum seekers, including a meta-analysis of more than 5000 adults in 2020 that estimated a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence of 31%.10,11 A more recent 2021 study of 57 asylum seekers from Central America, a region impacted by the MPP, showed PTSD rates approaching 79%.12 With respect to the MPP, several small case series and reports from nongovernmental organizations have raised concerns about the exacerbation of trauma for those subjected to the MPP.13-17 However, larger systematic studies on individuals exposed to the MPP remain limited, in part due to challenges with access and follow-up in this displaced population. To address this gap, forensic medical evaluations and legal affidavits, which are frequently collected to support asylum claims by providing objective documentation of trauma, could serve as valuable resources for examining the association of health outcomes with the MPP. To better understand the association of exposure to the MPP with migration-related trauma, we examined legal affidavits and forensic medical examinations of 94 asylum seekers at an academic-affiliated asylum clinic, comparing traumatic experiences before and after the implementation of the MPP in 2019.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated traumatic experiences before and after the introduction of the MPP in January 2019. Participants were selected between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, from an academic-affiliated asylum clinic providing pro bono forensic evaluations to asylum seekers. These forensic medical evaluations were performed for asylum seekers to document objective findings of their previous trauma and are associated with a higher rate of asylum application success. A study of over 2800 asylum applicants between 2008 and 2018 found that nearly 82% of those applying for immigration relief were granted relief compared with only 42% without a forensic medical examination.18 Clinicians performing the forensic medical evaluations undergo training to follow the Istanbul Protocol, which is a set of international guidelines for the effective investigation and documentation of torture and other human rights violations.19 Evaluations were conducted by the University of Southern California Human Rights Clinic in Los Angeles, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, as well as remotely due to limitations with the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility criteria included all asylum seekers aged 18 years or older who completed forensic medical examinations at the clinic during this period. Exclusions included age younger than 18 years, examinations missing substantial data, and cases containing potentially identifiable material even after deidentification. Of 108 forensic evaluations screened, 14 were excluded (9 individuals younger than 18 years, 3 records with duplicate information, and 2 with insufficient data) leaving 94 cases for analysis (eFigure in Supplement 1). Data from legal declarations and forensic exams were securely stored in REDCap and deidentified. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Southern California Social Behavioral Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement of informed consent due to the research being retrospective and posing minimal risk to participants with deidentified data. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.

A standardized data abstraction form was developed to record demographic characteristics (age, sex, and country of origin) and study outcomes focusing on MPP exposure, traumatic events, and reporting of PTSD. Exposure to the MPP was classified from the legal documentation and corroborated by forensic examiner report. The primary outcome variable of interest was traumatic exposures during migration, categorized as physical violence, sexual violence, violence against family or friends, violence by organized criminal groups, violence by government organizations, forced labor, and extortion or robbery (eTable in Supplement 1). Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed based on either documentation by the forensic examiner stating the participant’s presentation was consistent with PTSD or a formal score on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, when available. The demographic data in our study were collected using predefined categories on the intake form, which specified ethnicity rather than race. Ethnicity, when reported, was classified according to the original source documentation and recorded by the researchers given their potential relevance to the outcomes of interest. The available response options included: Asian; African, Afro-Latino, or Afro-Caribbean; Hispanic or Latin American; Middle Eastern; White; Other, and Not stated. “Other” included options such as Indigenous, Pacific Islander, or other multiracial backgrounds not captured by the other categories. Sex was documented in applications and included in the data abstraction. Conversely, gender identity was reported in a minority of cases, typically when relevant to the asylum claim (eg, persecution based on gender identity), so it was not systematically included in analyses, although LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and other) status, when reported, was recorded (Table 1). Data abstraction was performed by 3 researchers (K.J., S.M., and K.E.). Fifteen percent of cases were dual-abstracted to assess interrater reliability, showing high agreement between abstractors (pooled κ = 0.81). The remaining cases were divided evenly among the 3 researchers.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted from January 2023 to May 2025 using Stata, version 17 (StataCorp LLC). Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of exposure to the MPP with trauma during migration. Specifically, the odds of an asylum seeker reporting any of the traumatic events listed during migration was measured. To limit potential confounders with the year of evaluation and changing asylum landscape, we divided patients into 3 groups anchored on the introduction of the MPP in January 2019: asylum seekers from 2016 to 2018 (n = 26), asylum seekers from 2019 to 2022 exposed to the MPP (n = 22), and asylum seekers from 2019 to 2022 who were not exposed to the MPP due to exemptions or alternative entry points (n = 46). Post-2019 is used to refer to the group that includes the years 2019 through 2022. Participants in the post-2019 non-MPP group were excluded from the MPP for a variety of reasons including alternate entry points and exemption from the policy based on home country.

Statistical tests were 2-sided. Logistic regression was performed between the pre-2019 group and both the post-2019 MPP and post-2019 non-MPP groups to calculate the odds that any traumatic event occurred during migration, reported as odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs and a preestablished statistical significance of α = .05. Additional sensitivity analysis was completed with only participants with a Latin American country of origin to assess for regional bias. Additional adjustments for other factors (age, sex, and reason for asylum) were not performed because of the small sample size.

Qualitative analysis was performed using a deductive approach. Quotations from affidavits and forensic examinations of MPP asylum seekers were reviewed and grouped into predefined trauma categories. Selected illustrative quotations were chosen to highlight key themes. All quotations were deidentified and pulled directly from source data. Some appear in first or third person, reflecting the way they were originally documented by attorneys or clinicians.

Results

Among 94 participants, the mean (SD) age was 33.1 (10.1) years, 56 (60%) were men and 38 (40%) were women, and 68 (72%) originated from Latin America, with Africa the next most common region (20 [21%]) (Table 1). Additional participants were from Asia, the Middle East, and Russia. The most common asylum claim across all groups was persecution based on social group membership, reported by 75 participants (80%), followed by political opinion, reported by 29 participants (31%). The MPP group had a younger mean (SD) age of 30.6 (6.9) years and higher percentage of participants from Latin America (19 of 22 [86%]).

The primary outcome, trauma reported during migration, was higher in the MPP group (14 of 22 participants [64%]) compared with in the pre-2019 group (3 of 26 participants [12%]) (OR, 9.20; 95% CI, 2.12-39.89) (Table 2). The post-2019 group not exposed to the MPP did not have higher odds of trauma (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.32-5.85). In a sensitivity analysis limited to participants from Latin America, the OR for trauma between the pre-2019 and MPP group was 4.40 (95% CI, 0.75-25.84), which did not reach statistical significance.

As a secondary outcome, the clinical examiner’s impression of PTSD was higher in the MPP group, (21 of 22 participants [95%]) than in the pre-2019 group (11 of 26 [42%]) (OR, 28.64; 95% CI, 3.33-246.25) (Table 2). In the post-2019 non-MPP group, 36 of 46 participants (78%) were assessed as having PTSD, a higher rate than the pre-2019 group (OR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.72-13.99).

In addition to the quantitative patterns of trauma prevalence, we examined qualitative narratives to further characterize the nature of traumatic experiences. Thematic analysis of affidavits and forensic examinations highlighted different forms of trauma reported by asylum seekers. Major themes included physical and sexual violence, violence directed toward family or friends, police violence, gang violence, extortion, forced labor, and robbery. These narratives contextualize the quantitative findings by illustrating the lived experiences of asylum seekers. Representative deidentified quotes for each theme are presented in Table 3 and map onto the higher rate of migration-related trauma observed quantitatively in the MPP group.

Discussion

This cohort study found that exposure to the MPP was associated with higher odds of migration-related trauma and PTSD among asylum seekers. These results highlight the association of MPP exposure with migration-related trauma and its potential downstream health outcomes. We discuss these findings in 3 areas: demographic, trauma and protective factors, and policy implications.

First, we examined demographic patterns across groups. Asylum seekers exposed to the MPP were the youngest group in our cohort and had the highest proportion from Latin America. This finding aligns with recent studies showing younger age distributions among asylum seekers in the US.20 Several factors may explain this finding. First, the MPP was originally designed to apply primarily to individuals from Latin American countries traversing Mexico, which shifted the affected population toward primarily Central American nationals. Second, trends from the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) in particular have shown an increase in younger migrants over the past decade.12 Data from the World Bank correlate with this finding, showing that Central American asylum seekers are increasingly arriving in their early 20s with a growing proportion of women and families compared with previous years.21 These demographic trends are consistent with our finding that the MPP group skewed younger than other groups in our cohort.

These results are consistent with previous research showing high rates of trauma at the US-Mexico border.12 ,14-16,22,23 Systemic gang violence was a common reason asylum seekers in our cohort fled their home country, and reports document that gang-related murders of deported asylum seekers and continued exploitation during migration continue to be problems facing migrants in Mexico.22 Returned migrants, known as “retornados,” face marginalization and risk revictimization.16 In a Mexican migrant encampment study, women expressed widespread fear of sexual violence and distrust of authorities.23 Such themes are demonstrated in our forensic evaluations (Table 3). For example, 1 participant described repeated robberies and direct threats from gang members, including receiving messages stating “I know where you are… where you live.” Another woman described an inability to secure safe lodging in Mexico, which led to sexual violence against her child.

In contrast, asylum seekers after 2019 who were not subjected to the MPP did not report higher rates of trauma. Access to safer communities and services in the US may have been protective against trauma. Research suggests that protective factors such as social support, faith, and civic engagement have been associated with decreased migrant stress.24 Those admitted to the US likely benefited more from these factors. However, while protective factors may mitigate the association of migration-related trauma, the more important distinction is that individuals exposed to the MPP were more likely to be placed in high-risk environments such as tent cities or unsafe border regions with inherently higher trauma exposure.

Similar patterns have emerged globally, where restrictive policies and high-risk environments have been associated with higher rates of trauma and a greater burden of mental health disease among displaced populations. Research on Syrian refugees living in tent-city camps documented overcrowding, insecurity, and limited access to basic services being associated with a high rate of PTSD.25 Médecins Sans Frontières reported that among a group of migrants who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy, over 80% of respondents experienced torture either in their country of origin or in transit, most commonly at the hands of traffickers (61%) or law enforcement (29%).26 More than one-third of these incidents occurred in countries designated by European authorities as “safe” for migrants. This parallels the experiences of individuals in our cohort who, despite being returned to Mexico under the MPP, continued to report unsafe and harmful conditions. Similarly, a study of nearly 500 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh found high rates of depression and PTSD that were linked not only with exposure to previous trauma but also ongoing daily stressors such as overcrowding, food insecurity, and violence and crime in their refugee camps.27 Together, these findings highlight how restrictive migration and asylum policies such as the MPP that compel migrants to remain in unsafe environments can perpetuate rather than alleviate trauma among displaced populations.

These results should be interpreted in the broader context of ongoing US border policy debates. Although the MPP aimed to manage migration and strengthen border security, it was associated in our study with higher reported rates of violence, exploitation, and psychological distress. This finding adds to evidence that deterrent-based approaches may be associated with higher rates of migrant trauma and reliance on riskier migration routes, compounding the premigration trauma that compelled many asylum seekers to flee their home countries in the first place.28

Despite its suspension in 2021, the MPP was reinstated in January 2025 and continues to shape the asylum process.7 Other recent measures, such as the US Department of Homeland Security Third Country Removals,29 permit deportation to countries where assurances of migrant safety are uncertain. Although such policies may reduce cross-border entry or perpetuate the image of security in the short term, our results suggest that they may do so at the cost of exposing migrants to unsafe environments. Policymakers should therefore weigh not only border security objectives but also the public health and human rights consequences of these policies.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the health and safety of asylum seekers in the design of asylum policies. Potential approaches such as expanded legal pathways, increased access to mental and trauma support, and targeted international initiatives to address root causes of migration, such as systemic violence and economic instability in countries of origin, could reduce the harms observed in this study. If the MPP continues, a more robust multinational effort to ensure asylum seekers receive adequate protection and basic social support would be important for their health and safety.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the sample was drawn from a medicolegal clinic that evaluates primarily asylum seekers who have obtained legal representation and undergone forensic medical examinations. Amnesty International has estimated that only 5% of asylum seekers subject to the MPP have been able to obtain legal representation, so our patient population likely represents a subgroup with greater access to legal and medical resources.6 Second, the retrospective design of this study limits causal inference and relies on preexisting documentation, which may vary in documentation style and introduce reporting bias. For example, the higher rate of PTSD observed in both the MPP and post-2019 non-MPP groups may reflect increased attention to screening and documentation of PTSD in recent years rather than true differences among groups.

Preexisting conditions and socioeconomic factors were not controlled for and may have confounded the observed associations. The MPP group skewed younger and had a larger proportion of migrants from Central America. A planned sensitivity analysis limited to Latin American participants showed that the odds of migration-related trauma in the MPP group was not significantly different compared with the pre-2019 group, highlighting that migration from Latin America, a region heavily affected by violence and instability, may be an independent risk factor in itself for migration-related trauma.12 In addition, logistic regression analyses were unadjusted given the small sample size, which limited our ability to control for all factors. Finally, other asylum policies implemented after 2019, such as the asylum transit ban and changes to US Customs and Border Protection processing, may have contributed to the observed differences, making it difficult to isolate the associations of MPP alone.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of asylum seekers before and after the introduction of the MPP in 2019, exposure to the MPP was associated with higher rates of trauma experiences during migration and a higher rate of PTSD reported in forensic medical examinations. These findings highlight the possible health consequences of restrictive border policies and underscore the need for immigration policies that consider the safety and well-being of asylum seekers throughout the migration process.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/939758/zoi251354t1_1766526075.21591.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=OXtrjfMik3Amwe3VBf-XQZulDWr6VB~pXDdDEvUY-A5Jp6LAkSfYGKVg3X64hOf0~01ofJQmo-U6ypcRyHnkNCgfMVfMrFT6OXYQ424WHkW5yQCC5MtirI8rS-VdWlsCo2hFZQP4Pxc64HDIdl-JBIkMkA3MOvNItquen7w1KuEhHZfWwpd8lKw3MBqw50eBvTkp9Fwy~Uc0XjlrAi3ta~jfR6NsHvvmEfKE~n4R5~gvxy~DqKjHLEymMmn1Hzwnx0~GzV2fzpMUQjDVgdRpKq0ks125r10fdgR~Nt5gd5Adin3pTZAxD6HCZJgpmlo12l9YQYOLWSHlYvVmTimMgg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,,2026-01-06 14:57:21.711024

Proposal would hold sanctuary sheriffs accountable with criminal penalties, removal from office; modeled on Texas law upheld by federal courts

Representative Nancy Mace today proposed the South Carolina Immigration Enforcement Act, legislation that would impose penalties on sheriffs and jail administrators who refuse to honor federal immigration detainer requests. The bill is modeled on Texas SB 4, which was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018.

“South Carolina already bans sanctuary cities on paper. This bill puts teeth behind that ban,” said Rep. Mace. “If a sheriff releases a criminal illegal alien back onto our streets because they refuse to work with ICE, they should face the consequences, including removal from office.”

Under current South Carolina law, political subdivisions are prohibited from adopting sanctuary policies, but lacks enforcement. The State Law Enforcement Division has never found a single jurisdiction out of compliance, even as some have refused dozens of ICE detainer requests and been designated “non-cooperative” by federal immigration authorities.

The South Carolina Immigration Enforcement Act would:

• Require jails to honor ICE detainer requests and notify ICE 48 hours before releasing detainees

• Create a misdemeanor offense for those who knowingly refuse to comply, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine

• Trigger automatic removal from office upon conviction

• Impose civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day on noncompliant jurisdictions

• Cut off Local Government Fund appropriations for three years to jurisdictions that violate the law

• Allow any citizen to file a complaint with the Attorney General

BUILT TO WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES

The legislation was drafted to address anticipated Constitutional challenges that have been raised against similar laws in other states:

Anti-Commandeering Doctrine: The Supreme Court’s ruling in Printz v. United States (1997) held that the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. However, this bill is a state law requiring state officers to cooperate with federal authorities, not a federal mandate. States have broad authority to direct their own employees. The Fifth Circuit upheld Texas SB 4 on precisely this basis, finding that a state choosing to require its officers to cooperate with ICE does not violate anti-commandeering principles.

Fourth Amendment Concerns: Some courts have found that holding individuals solely on an ICE detainer, which is an administrative request, not a judicial warrant, may violate the Fourth Amendment. This bill addresses that concern by including an explicit exception: if the detainee provides proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status (driver’s license, passport, or federal documentation), the detainer compliance requirement does not apply. This mirrors the Texas model that survived court challenge.

Due Process / Removal from Office: The bill’s removal provision is grounded in existing South Carolina constitutional and statutory authority. Article VI, Section 8 of the South Carolina Constitution provides that any officer convicted of a “crime involving moral turpitude” may be suspended by the Governor and, upon conviction, the position “shall be declared vacant.” The bill explicitly designates a violation as official misconduct under S.C. Code §8-1-80, which already provides for removal upon conviction. This is not a novel mechanism, it leverages existing state law.

First Amendment / Criminalizing Speech: Unlike Tennessee’s recent legislation which criminalizes voting for sanctuary policies, this bill criminalizes only the act of knowingly refusing to comply with a detainer, not speech, advocacy, or voting. This avoids First Amendment concerns that could arise from punishing officials for their policy positions rather than their conduct.

Indemnification / Liability Shield: The bill includes a state indemnification provision protecting law enforcement agencies and officers from civil liability when they comply with detainer requests in good faith. This removes a key excuse some sheriffs have cited for non-cooperation, fear of lawsuits, while ensuring officers are protected when following state law.

“We studied what worked in Texas and what’s being challenged elsewhere,” Rep. Mace said. “This bill is designed to hold up in court. It uses existing South Carolina constitutional provisions, follows the Texas model the Fifth Circuit already blessed, and avoids the First Amendment problems in Tennessee’s approach.”

Mace previously led congressional oversight efforts investigating South Carolina Sanctuary Sheriff Kristin Graziano who refused to cooperate with ICE. Subsequently, Graziano released many violent, criminal illegal aliens onto the streets of South Carolina from 2021 to 2024 when voters elected a new sheriff due to this issue.

The number of 287(g) agreements in South Carolina has grown from 3 to 20 counties since January 2025, along with the State Law Enforcement Division and three municipalities.

“Our sheriffs who are doing it right deserve recognition. Any one who isn’t should be held accountable. This bill does both, and it’s built to last. There will never be another sanctuary sheriff in South Carolina if I’m in charge.”

I hope that you managed to have a bit of break over the holidays and are feeling well rested and ready for the many challenges that we already know 2026 will have in store, both for migrants and for those of us working to support them.

Regulations laid just before the break have brought some provisions of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act into force today, including the ability to take people’s mobile phones from them when they arrive in the UK. This seems likely to make it more difficult for people to access and provide evidence for their asylum claim, as well as creating barriers to maintaining contact with family. Access to legal representatives will need to be facilitated somehow. I will write up a short post on the regulations as a whole a.s.a.p. but I have looked at these powers in a bit more detail here.

Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) has died, GOP leadership and President Trump confirmed Tuesday morning.
“Jacquie and I are devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.
“He was the leader of the Western caucus — a fierce champion on California water issues,” Trump said.
A native of Oroville, LaMalfa attended Butte College and then earned an ag-business degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
He served in the California Assembly from 2002 to 2008 and the California State Senate from 2010 to 2012.","California Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) has died, GOP leadership and President Trump confirmed Tuesday morning.

“Jacquie and I are devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa. Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,” said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the House majority whip, in a post on X. “Our prayers are with Doug’s wife, Jill, and their children.”

LaMalfa, 65, was a fourth-generation rice farmer from Oroville and staunch Trump supporter who had represented his Northern California district for the last 12 years. His seat was one of several that was in jeopardy under the state’s redrawn districts approved by voters with Proposition 50.

Emergency personnel responded to a 911 call from LaMalfa’s residence at 6:50 p.m. Monday, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. The congressman was taken to the Enloe Medical Center in Chico, where he died while undergoing emergency surgery, authorities said.

An autopsy to determine the cause of death is planned, according to the sheriff’s office.

LaMalfa’s district — which stretches from the northern outskirts of Sacramento, through Redding at the northern end of the Central Valley and Alturas in the state’s northeast corner — is largely rural, and constituents have long said they felt underrepresented in liberal California.

LaMalfa put much of his focus on boosting federal water supplies to farmers, and seeking to reduce environmental restrictions on logging and extraction of other natural resources.

One LaMalfa’s final acts in the U.S. House was to successfully push for the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools Act, a long-standing financial aid program for schools surrounded by untaxed federal forest land, whose budgets could not depend upon property taxes, as most public schools do. Despite broad bipartisan support, Congress let it lapse in 2023.

In an interview with The Times as he was walking onto the House floor in mid-December, LaMalfa said he was frustrated with Congress’s inability to pass even a popular bill like that reauthorization.

The Secure Rural Schools Act, he said, was a victim of a Congress in which “it’s still an eternal fight over anything fiscal.” It is “annoying,” LaMalfa said, “how hard it is to get basic things done around here.”

In a statement posted on X, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said he considered LaMalfa “a friend and partner” and that the congressman was “deeply committed to his community and constituents, working to make life better for those he represented.”

“Doug’s life was one of great service and he will be deeply missed,” Schiff wrote.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement called LaMalfa a “devoted public servant who deeply loved his country, his state, and the communities he represented.”

“While we often approached issues from different perspectives, he fought every day for the people of California with conviction and care,” Newsom said.

Flags at the California State Capitol in Sacramento will be flown at half-staff in honor of the congressman, according to the governor.

Before his death, LaMalfa was facing a difficult reelection bid to hold his seat. After voters approved Proposition 50 in November — aimed at giving California Democrats more seats in Congress — LaMalfa was drawn into a new district that heavily favored his likely opponent, state Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat who represents the state’s northwest coast.

LaMalfa’s death puts the Republican majority in Congress in further jeopardy, with a margin of just two votes to secure passage of any bill along party lines after the resignation of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday evening.

Adding to the party’s troubles, Rep. Jim Baird, a Republican from Indiana, was hospitalized on Tuesday for a car crash described by the White House as serious. While Baird is said to be stable, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson from Louisiana, will not be able to rely on his attendance. And he has one additional caucus member — Thomas Massie of Kentucky — who has made a habit of voting against the president, bringing their margin for error down effectively to zero.

President Trump, addressing a gathering of GOP House members at the Kennedy Center, addressed the news at the start of his remarks, expressing “tremendous sorrow at the loss of a great member” and stating his speech would be made in LaMalfa’s honor.

“He was the leader of the Western caucus — a fierce champion on California water issues,” Trump said. “He was great on water. ‘Release the water!’ he’d scream out. And a true defender of American children.”

“You know, he voted with me 100% of the time,” Trump added.

A native of Oroville, LaMalfa attended Butte College and then earned an ag-business degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He served in the California Assembly from 2002 to 2008 and the California State Senate from 2010 to 2012. Staunchly conservative, he was an early supporter of Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in California, and he also pushed for passage of the Protection of Marriage Act, Proposition 22, which banned same-sex marriage in California.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c0773f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5392x2831+0+381/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2F30%2F590e97e6485a910937ce92745cab%2Fla-me-doug-lamalfa-town-hall03-ha.JPG,N,,2026-01-06 13:57:20.037247

President Donald Trump did not exceed his authority when he issued a Sept. 19 proclamation requiring employers to pay an additional $100,000 before new H-1B visas can be processed, a federal district court judge held Dec. 23 in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

President Trump legitimately exercised his broad discretion authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the entry of noncitizens into the U.S., the judge found. Trump found the proclamation was necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B program, which the proclamation asserts is harming American workers and creating a national security threat, he said.

The ruling does not discount the contributions H-1B workers are making to the American economy, the judge stressed. But the parties’ debate over how the proclamation will affect employers and the economy is not within the court’s province to decide, so long as it is within the confines of the law, she said.

Dive Insight:

The Association of American Universities and the Chamber, a business federation with approximately 300,000 members, sued the Trump Administration in October. It was the first of at least three lawsuits by different groups challenging the proclamation, including California v. Noem, filed mid-December by 20 state attorney generals from mainly Democratic states.

The litigation focuses on two issues — that President Trump exceeded his delegated authority, or acted “ultra vires,” under the INA and that DHS and the State Department “arbitrarily” implemented the proclamation without following proper notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The judge ruled against AAU and the Chamber on both claims. The INA’s “exceedingly broad language” gives President Trump the authority to issue the proclamation, which he backed with evidence showing how the H-1B program is being abused, and the proclamation does not contravene the INA’s H-1B scheme, the judge held.

As for the second issue, DHS and the State Department “plainly do not act ‘arbitrarily and capriciously’ or ‘contrary to law’ in implementing a legally permissible presidential directive,” the judge wrote. “Indeed, defendants here had no other course of action” because agencies “‘may not simply disregard’ a binding presidential directive,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security says that the man had a rifle and pointed it at the agent.

The family has a lot of questions, and what they're looking for most of all are answers. About a dozen of the man's family and community members came together on Monday to ensure that there is a thorough investigation.

""From day one that he was born, I knew that he was my joy,"" said Franceola Armstrong, the mother of 43-year-old Keith Porter.

Armstrong described her son as caring, hardworking and uplifting to those around him.

""When he came around, people looked for him. He was a joy to be around. My son, the biggest heart, sympathetic, appreciative, so much gratitude,"" Armstrong said.

On New Year's Eve, the father of two was shot and killed by an off-duty ICE agent.

According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the ICE agent said he heard gunshots outside of his apartment that sounded like they were getting closer. DHS says, ""The officer took his ICE-authorized firearm and left his apartment to investigate.""

Loved ones say Porter fired gunshots outside as part of a New Year's Eve celebration.

""He claims he heard gunshots were getting closer to his apartment, but rather than staying at a position of safety, he left his apartment and went downstairs to what would be a position of danger,"" said attorney Jamal Tooson with Lessem, Newstat & Tooson.

According to DHS, the ICE agent identified himself, and that's when Porter aimed the rifle at him. The agent then ordered Porter to put down the weapon, and when he didn't comply, the off-duty officer shot him. The agency claims Porter fired three rounds at the officer before he died. The off-duty ICE officer was not injured.

Tooson, however, says they've spoken with neighbors who say they did not hear an agent identify themselves.

Now, Porter's family and attorney are looking for answers. They say the ICE officer wasn't trained for that situation and should have called police and waited for them to arrive.

""But instead of staying in his apartment for a trained law enforcement officer from LAPD to respond, he made the premeditated and calculated decision to grab a firearm,"" Tooson said.

New York Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman, who served as a top lawyer in the House Democratic effort to impeach Trump in 2019 before winning a congressional bid three years later, announced he's running for re-election.

Goldman's announcement video leans heavily on his experience both in the Trump impeachment and in Congress, specifically noting legislative attempts to ban immigration arrests in courts, bar ICE agents from wearing masks during immigration arrests and prohibit congressional stock trades. He announced his decision on the fifth anniversary of the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which he invoked while criticizing Trump's ""attacks on our democracy.""

Goldman closed the video with an indirect swipe ahead of a primary challenge from former state Comptroller Brad Lander, an ally of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani who is running against Goldman from his left.

""With the stakes so high, we can't mess around with empty promises from career politicians, we need experienced, decisive leadership,"" Goldman said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., slammed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's announced overhaul yesterday of the childhood vaccine schedule that recommends fewer shots.

Cassidy, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement on X that as a doctor who treated patients for decades, his top priority is protecting children and families. He noted that multiple children have died or have been hospitalized after contracting measles and two kids died in his state from whooping cough.

""All of this was preventable with safe and effective vaccines,"" Cassidy said. ""The vaccine schedule IS NOT A MANDATE. It’s a recommendation giving parents the power. Changing the pediatric vaccine schedule based on no scientific input on safety risks and little transparency will cause unnecessary fear for patients and doctors, and will make America sicker.""

The CDC is recommending that all children get vaccines for 11 diseases, down from the 18 that were previously on the childhood schedule.

European NATO allies warned the United States today that they would “not stop defending” the values of sovereignty and territorial integrity following Trump’s threats against the Danish island of Greenland.

Trump and his team have ramped up hostile suggestions that they want to seize Greenland, a vast Artic island of just 50,000 people that has mineral and strategic significance. The U.S. attack against Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro — which the United Nations said undermined international law — has raised fears that this might not be an empty threat.

The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.

George Conway, the longtime conservative lawyer who became a prominent critic of Trump, is officially launching a Democratic campaign for Congress in Manhattan today, the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

In an interview, Conway framed his campaign for New York’s 12th District squarely around Trump, calling for his impeachment and for the U.S. to undertake a “modern legal reconstruction” to “make sure this never happens again.”

“We’re at a crossroads in our country, and Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the Constitution and the rule of law and democratic government that we have ever seen in our lifetime,” Conway, 62, said. “And I want to fight that. He’s a criminal. He defies the law. He thinks he’s the law, and that’s not just an abstraction about the rule of law. He’s hurting people in this country and in my district by using his power to enrich himself instead of using it for the good of the people. He’s running the country like a mob boss.”

Trump mass pardoned Jan. 6 rioters on his first day back in office. Justice Department officials and FBI agents involved in the massive investigation and prosecution were fired. Dozens of other supporters involved in efforts to overturn the election results have been pre-emptively pardoned.

Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.

Since Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.

But the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.

Experts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.

“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.

He pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter, which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.

“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”

An uphill battle

Since August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.

That month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.

That deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a build-up of US military assets near Venezuela.

Trump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.

The strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.

Both resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.

But speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the US operation on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.

Republicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military build-up in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.

“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.

In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.

Bash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.

“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.

Republicans ho-hum about resolutions

Under the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.

Instead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

No AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.

When lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a war powers resolution requiring Congressional approval for further actions.

Beyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.

However, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.

Given the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.

Republicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.

In November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.

December’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.

But Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a tiny fragment of his party.

Overall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.

Senator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.

“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.

Some Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.

That included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.

In a statement on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.

“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.

In December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.

What comes next?

For its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has sought to send the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.

Trump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.

“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”

Since Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.

That threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was formally sworn in as the country’s interim president on Monday.

“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.

The administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.

Constitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.

Failure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s growing power over the military.

“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.

“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.

“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26006037081044-1767663789.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-06 13:57:24.639037

Will a U.S. court allow the Department of Justice to prosecute a sitting foreign head of state?
Instead, it has argued (as in the Noriega case) that Maduro isn’t entitled to be treated as a head of state.
That said, the United States has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela’s head of state since 2019.
Assuming a U.S. court determines he is not entitled to immunity as a sitting head of state, a different immunity analysis would apply.","On Jan. 5, Nicolas Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges in a Manhattan courtroom and told the judge, “I am still president.” This is an imagined conversation between two people in the courtroom, one of whom happens to be an international law professor.

Why did Maduro tell the judge he’s still president? Why does that matter?

Under international law binding on the United States (and all countries), the sitting head of state or head of government of one country can’t be sued or prosecuted in another country’s courts. That’s why the U.S. president can travel to other countries without worrying about being sued, prosecuted, or arrested. This is such a well-accepted principle that it’s not codified in any treaty, but it has been restated innumerable times, including by the International Court of Justice and the U.S. State Department. The technical term for this is immunity rationae personae, or personal immunity, and it also extends to foreign ministers and likely to defense ministers. It is designed to protect leaders of foreign countries from being hindered in performing their duties and is rooted in the idea that all countries are equal on the international plane (that is, they have sovereign equality).

But didn’t the United States prosecute Manuel Noriega after abducting him from Panama in 1989?

Yes. The United States didn’t recognize General Manuel Noriega, who was a military dictator, as Panama’s head of state, and the government of Panama didn’t request immunity on his behalf. (Especially in contested cases, it matters whether the government of a country tells the court and/or the State Department that an individual holds a particular position in that government that entitles them to immunity.) So U.S. courts let that prosecution go forward. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned that Noriega wasn’t entitled to immunity “given that the record indicates that Noriega never served as the constitutional leader of Panama, that Panama has not sought immunity for Noriega and that the charged acts relate to Noriega’s private pursuit of personal enrichment.”

It’s important to keep in mind, though, that recognition by one country alone doesn’t change whether a genuine head of state is entitled to immunity on that basis. If that were the case, countries could game the law by simply withdrawing their recognition, nabbing foreign leaders, and trying them in their courts. The Panama case was arguably more complicated because there were democratically elected authorities in Panama who also did not consider Noriega to be the legitimate head of state.

And more recently the U.S. also prosecuted the former president of Honduras?

Yes, although because Juan Orlando Hernandez was a former, not a sitting, head of state, his prosecution did not violate head of state immunity. Also, importantly, in that case the United States requested and obtained his extradition from Honduras through legal channels. In addition, a country can always waive its own official’s immunity or decline to support the official’s claim to immunity.

Who decides whether to waive an official’s immunity?

Generally, it is the de facto authorities of the official’s home country. It can be complicated, though, especially if there are different political groups within a single country that are all vying for power. There is definitely a risk that arrest and extradition can serve as a convenient way to get rid of political rivals. That’s why international human rights law requires that defendants receive procedural protections, both in the extradition process and when they are eventually tried and prosecuted. Most extradition treaties also have exceptions under which a country that is asked to extradite an alleged offender can refuse to do so on the grounds that the request is politically motivated–but this doesn’t help if the extraditing country also supports the prosecution.

Will a U.S. court allow the Department of Justice to prosecute a sitting foreign head of state?

U.S. courts have dismissed civil suits filed against foreign sitting heads of state. If the U.S. government tried to prosecute a foreign sitting head of state that the executive branch recognized as such, then international law would certainly require a court to dismiss the case. But U.S. courts haven’t faced this particular dilemma, because in Maduro’s case the executive branch isn’t seeking to prosecute someone that it recognizes as a sitting foreign head of state. Instead, it has argued (as in the Noriega case) that Maduro isn’t entitled to be treated as a head of state.

The judiciary does not owe absolute deference to the executive branch on all foreign affairs matters, but it does give the executive branch deference on recognition decisions. It would be interesting to see what a court did in a clear cut case where non-recognition was absurd on its face – for example, if the Department of Justice said “the United States doesn’t recognize Mark Carney as Canada’s head of government,” or “the United States doesn’t recognize Emmanuel Macron as France’s head of state.”

This is a more complicated case. On the one hand, Venezuela now has an interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, sworn in shortly after Maduro’s capture. On the other hand, Rodriguez has publicly called for Maduro’s release and said he is still President of Venezuela. The case could take an interesting turn if Venezuela – through an amicus brief perhaps – informs the court that it has not waived Maduro’s immunity and he remains their head of state.

That said, the United States has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela’s head of state since 2019. That will likely be decisive for a U.S. judge under domestic law because of the executive branch’s exclusive recognition power, even though head-of-state status under international law does not depend on any single country’s recognition decision. Generally, under international law, if an individual has the legal authority to bind the country in its international relations, that person would be considered the head of state regardless of how that person assumed the position.

So international law doesn’t matter?

The United States always indicates when it files immunity determinations with U.S. courts that it is doing so after considering “the relevant principles of customary international law.” The biggest deterrent to violating international law regarding immunities is that other countries can start doing the same thing. The United States has often violated international law with apparent impunity, but every time it does so the international system becomes less stable and less predictable, in addition to less just. Moreover, it should go without saying that disregarding immunity for other countries or their officials also risks eroding the well-established norms that protect the United States and its officials in foreign courts.

Speaking of stability and predictability, what about the military operation to capture Maduro? Doesn’t that make his prosecution illegal?

There is zero international legal justification for conducting a military operation on another country’s territory to capture an alleged fugitive, let alone a foreign leader, without that country’s consent or authorization by the U.N. Security Council. But international law and U.S. law separate the question of how a defendant’s presence was obtained before a court from whether that defendant can be prosecuted. In international law, the principle is called male captus, bene detentus. It essentially boils down to the idea that a person can be unlawfully captured, but still lawfully prosecuted, as long as the proceedings themselves comply with applicable law.

Once Venezuela has a new acting president, will that change Maduro’s status? Can he claim immunity as a former head of state?

If relevant Venezuelan authorities do not treat Maduro as the head of state, then he would no longer be able to claim that status. As noted above, this question may be disputed if his successor maintains that he is still the head of state. Assuming a U.S. court determines he is not entitled to immunity as a sitting head of state, a different immunity analysis would apply.

Former foreign officials enjoy certain residual, conduct-based immunities for their official acts. However, drug trafficking and corruption do not fall within any head of state’s official duties. Such charges do not raise the immunity questions sometimes associated with legal proceedings against former foreign officials for international crimes such as torture that are necessarily committed under color of law. (There is also a separate question of immunity for international crimes before international courts; although Venezuela has announced its intended withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, its ratification of the treaty that created that court amounts to a renunciation of official immunities before the ICC for conduct that falls within the court’s jurisdiction.)

Setting aside Maduro’s unlawful capture, isn’t his prosecution a good thing?

That’s really a question for Venezuelans to answer, especially since the person who has now assumed power was Maduro’s vice president and close associate. It’s difficult for the United States to have credibility in upholding the rule of law when it so willingly violates it and applies inconsistent standards–whether it’s pardoning Hernandez while prosecuting Maduro and executing suspected drug couriers, or defying domestic court orders. Ideally, each country is responsible for ensuring its own compliance with both domestic and international law, with action by foreign or international courts available as a back-up when national institutions fail. In the U.S. legal and political system, the power to rein in a lawless executive branch lies primarily with Congress and with voters, not with courts. That’s one reason why the contours of domestic official immunity don’t necessarily mirror those of foreign official immunity.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254805778-e1767707254870.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:58:03.275657

Why it matters: The spiritual panic blended with cultural revival comes as the immigration crackdown continues with no end in sight — despite consistent legal challenges and declining public support for the harsh tactics.

Figures like St. Jude and Santa Muerte have popped up at protests and on car dashboards as the Trump administration orders aggressive ICE raids and tightens legal immigration channels.

""When folks feel like they have no other recourse but the divine, or the supernatural, these types of saints become really important,"" Andrew Chesnut, the Bishop Walter F. Sullivan chairman in Catholic Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, tells Axios.

Zoom in: At migrant shelters and Latino parishes, images of saints known to help migrants and travelers have spread in recent months.

St. Jude, an official Catholic Saint of Lost Causes, has been seen at demonstrations and outside immigration detention facilities.

Mother Cabrini, patron saint of immigrants, has appeared at protests and candlelight vigils near federal immigration courts.

Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Mother of the Americas, can be found at rapid-response networks, emergency community meetings and roadside altars built after immigration sweeps.

Santo Toribio Romo, widely known as ""el Padre Pollero"" (the Holy Coyote) and as the unofficial patron saint of migrants and border crossers, has shown up in wallets and on necklaces.

The intrigue: Some immigrants are even embracing folk saints unsanctioned by the Catholic Church and often associated with drug cartels.

La Santa Muerte, or Holy Death, a skeleton figure resembling the Grim Reaper, has appeared on dashboards, on candles, and on murals to protect immigrants from arrest.

""One of her main hats is protectress of migrants. A great majority of devotees aren't narcos — they're people in desperate situations,"" Chesnut said.

Jesús Malverde, sometimes referred to as the ""angel of the poor"" and strongly identified with the Sinaloa Cartel, has morphed into another figure to help poor migrants.

State of play: The rising, very public devotion to saints comes as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has increasingly pushed back against the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement.

In November, the bishops overwhelmingly voted on a rare ""Special Pastoral Message"" condemning the indiscriminate mass deportation of immigrants and calling for humane policy rooted in human dignity.

Between the lines: The saints' stories — of exile, danger, persecution and perseverance — mirror the lived experiences of migrant families facing raids, family separations and deportation orders.

In this climate, saints function as emotional lifelines, letting migrants reclaim a semblance of security when the government's actions feel unpredictable and punitive, Chesnut said.

Devotion has become both a private survival strategy and an element of public cultural resilience, especially in communities where trust in institutions has collapsed, he added.

The bottom line: Growing opposition to Trump's immigration crackdown doesn't appear to be affecting the administration's policies, and immigration reform proposals in Congress aren't going anywhere.

Agents have been pulled off complex cases, including investigations into cyber-attacks, domestic extremism, drug trafficking and sanctions evasion, the letter said.
Entire HSI units have reportedly been reassigned to immigration enforcement, the letter continued.
She said Trump was keeping his promises on deportations, adding: “Any insinuation that the Trump administration isn’t successfully combating dangerous crime is false and uninformed.
With narcotic seizures and human smuggling arrests up significantly, paired with a historically secure border, the Trump administration is making America safer than ever before.” The FBI declined to comment.","The Trump administration has abandoned efforts to combat child exploitation, human trafficking and cartels as it diverts thousands of law enforcement personnel to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Democratic senators said in a letter to the White House.

Ruben Gallego of Arizona, along with 28 other Democratic senators and one independent, wrote to the president, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday demanding federal officials provide a “full accounting” of officers who have been redirected to immigration enforcement and a list of all investigations impacted by the reassignments.

The letter, first shared with the Guardian, follows a series of reports suggesting that the president’s push to dramatically expand its force of immigration officers has hampered a wide range of law-enforcement priorities. The senators cited an ICE document from August 2025, published by the Cato Institute, a thinktank, which said more than 28,000 personnel from federal law-enforcement agencies had been diverted from their regular duties to work for ICE’s enforcement and removal operations (ERO), which conducts raids and arrests undocumented people.

The letter referenced a New York Times investigation in November finding the intense focus on deportations has taken resources away from investigations into sexual crimes against children, an inquiry into a black market that finances terrorism, and federal efforts to combat human smuggling and sex trafficking.

“You have pulled agents away from some of the federal government’s most critical criminal investigations, weakening the very work that ensures public safety. In a world in which we must prioritize the use of limited resources, an agent arresting primarily non-violent immigrants necessarily means one less agent available to catch child predators and drug traffickers,” said the letter, which was signed by a majority of Democratic senators.

“This diversion represents a deliberate choice: a stunning abdication of the basic responsibilities of the executive branch to the American people, and a direct threat to the security of communities across the country.”

The reassignments come as ICE has engaged in a massive recruitment push, with the agency announcing on Saturday that it had hired more than 12,000 new officers and employees over the last year.

The number of people in ICE custody hit an all-time high in December, with more than 68,400 people in detention, the Guardian reported. Immigrants with no criminal record now make up the largest group in ICE detention, contradicting the administration’s repeated assertions that it is focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst”.

The senators’ letter, sent to Trump, DHS secretary Kristi Noem and attorney general Pam Bondi, said the administration’s reassignments were designed to “fuel a politically motivated deportation agenda that bears little relationship to actual security or safety priorities”.

Affected agencies, the senators said, include the FBI, the Marshals Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Defense, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

Agents have been pulled off complex cases, including investigations into cyber-attacks, domestic extremism, drug trafficking and sanctions evasion, the letter said. The senators said the impacts have been “especially devastating” at Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a DHS branch charged with combating child exploitation and a range of criminal organizations, including cartels.

Entire HSI units have reportedly been reassigned to immigration enforcement, the letter continued. The senators cited accounts from engineers at major tech companies who have reported a “noticeable drop in follow-up from federal officials” when they report child safety issues.

Efforts to combat gun violence have also been “eviscerated” as 80% of ATF special agents have been redirected to immigration, the letter said, citing a November CNN report. And nearly half of FBI agents working in the US’s major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to data released by Senator Mark Warner in October.

The Democrats demanded the administration respond by 19 January disclosing threat assessments that informed the reassignments; all communications directing agencies to provide personnel for ICE; and any internal objections raised by leadership and investigators.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, criticized the letter in an email to the Guardian, accusing Gallego of “pander[ing] to a radical left base ahead of his doomed-to-fail presidential run”.

“The characterization of HSI’s enforcement posture is selective, incomplete, and badly out of step with the actual data. FY25 was the highest year on record for HSI criminal enforcement, with more than 46,000 criminal arrests made – the most in the agency’s history,” Jackson wrote.

FY25 refers to the fiscal year from October 2024 through September 2025, which includes roughly four months of the Biden administration. The New York Times reporting on the HSI data found that as agents dramatically increased civil immigration arrests, narcotics arrests fell by roughly 11%, agents opened 15% fewer new investigations into narcotics crimes, and the number of weapons seized declined by 73%.

Jackson declined to provide specifics on the 46,000 arrests or comment on the declines in drug arrests and gun seizures, accusing the New York Times of “cherry-picking data to advance their preferred narrative when the facts tell a much different story”.

She said Trump was keeping his promises on deportations, adding: “Any insinuation that the Trump administration isn’t successfully combating dangerous crime is false and uninformed. With narcotic seizures and human smuggling arrests up significantly, paired with a historically secure border, the Trump administration is making America safer than ever before.”

We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies.

""We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,"" Everpeak Hospitality said.

CBS News learned Monday from multiple law enforcement officials that the Trump administration has started a massive deployment of hundreds of DHS agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota. Roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers could be sent as part of the crackdown.

Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to look into alleged fraud cases following last month's investigation by federal agents in Minneapolis that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said was for ""child care and other rampant fraud.""

Many of the sites visited by investigators on Dec. 29 were from a video, posted by conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley, which alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any service.

CBS News conducted its own analysis and visited several of the day care centers mentioned by Shirley: all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months. One was subjected to an unannounced inspection as recently as Dec. 4. Our review found dozens of citations related to safety, cleanliness, equipment and staff training, but there was no recorded evidence of fraud. Another day care shared security footage of people dropping off young children the same day that Shirley arrived and claimed the day care was empty.

The deployment started on Sunday and represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years.

The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon.

On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”

Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”

In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America.

“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”

The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”

The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”

Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela.

Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”

Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.”

Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions.

Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela.

Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans.

Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”

Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army.

Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.

Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”

“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”

David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…”

He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela.

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.

“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

Gov. Joe Lombardo, who is credited by Trump with helping lift him to victory in Nevada, did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s military action in the South American nation.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitoldarkskies-1024x7681767704637.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=cPOvWqYf,N,,2026-01-06 09:57:47.360451

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

“I am a kidnapped president, prisoner of war,” ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro told the judge in Manhattan federal court yesterday as he and his wife pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges. The couple are charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. Maduro is additionally charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy. Erica Orden reports for POLITICO.

U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended the capture of Maduro, saying “we are not occupying a country. This was a law enforcement operation” at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. In a statement read to the Council, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said the Trump administration had violated the U.N. charter, citing the capture of Maduro and the military incursion into a sovereign state. Several countries agreed that the action in Venezuela was a violation of the charter, including U.S. allies such as France, Denmark, and Spain. The United Kingdom struck a more cautious tone. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times; James Landale reports for BBC News.

Following yesterday’s classified briefing, top Republican and Democratic congressmen emerged with little clarity on the future of Venezuela. The briefing was carried out by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described the briefing as “extensive and long” with “far more questions than it ever answered,” adding that “their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying.” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said he expected an election to be called in Venezuela in “short order,” but added that “some of these things are still being determined.” Sen. Jim Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters ahead of the briefing that he would “probably” hold a hearing on Venezuela in the committee. Laura Kelly and Filip Timotija report for The Hill.

Rubio and other senior officials urged Trump not to back María Corina Machado as Maduro’s replacement. According to multiple sources, the officials said that U.S. backing of the opposition could further destabilize Venezuela and require a more robust military presence inside the country. A classified CIA intelligence analysis also reflected this view and concluded that Delcy Rodríguez, the vice president, was the best-positioned short-term successor. The CIA analysis was not focused on the forcible removal of Maduro, but examined a series of possibilities. Tyler Pager, Anatoly Kurmanaev, and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times; Julian E. Barnes and Tyler Pager New York Times.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro yesterday condemned the U.S. operation in Venezuela and responded to Trump’s comments that Colombia is run by a sick man, saying, “Come get me, I’m waiting for you here.” Also yesterday, Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said that Colombia will continue to work with the United States to fight drug trafficking using Washington’s intelligence and technology. “We will continue to emphasize the fight against this scourge, particularly on the Colombian-Venezuelan border,” Idarraga said. Reuters reports; Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude oil have left Venezuela since the start of the year, despite President Trump’s imposition of a blockade on all sanctioned tankers in mid-December, according to documents seen by Reuters and industry sources. All the departed vessels identified are under sanctions and most are now sailing without any known flag. It is unclear whether the United States had approved or allowed the shipments. Reuters reports.

U.S. forces plan to intercept the Marinera, a crude oil tanker that was sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2024 and that Russia has claimed jurisdiction over, according to four sources. The tanker was initially headed for Venezuela before turning around to avoid seizure by the U.S. Coast Guard last month. It was in the North Atlantic as of two days ago, near the coast of the United Kingdom. Two U.S. officials said that the plan would be to seize rather than sink the ship and could take place as early as this week. Two U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News that Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel disguised as civilians on tankers for defense purposes. James LaPorta reports; Natasha Bertrand, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen, and Avery Schmitz report for CNN.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner will attend a summit today in Paris focused on security guarantees to Ukraine in a future peace deal, a White House official said. The meeting will include leaders from roughly 30 countries who want to be part of the security guarantees and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

An Israeli airstrike in Gaza yesterday killed a 5-year-old girl and her uncle, and wounded two other children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital. The dead are among the more than 400 people killed in Gaza since an October ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The Israeli military said on social media that it struck a Hamas militant who planned an imminent strike on Israeli troops, adding that the strike complied with the ceasefire agreement. It is currently unclear whether the statement referred to the same fatal strike. Wafaa Shurafa and Sally Abou Aljoud report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH – CEASEFIRE

Israeli air strikes yesterday and this morning hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, including a commercial building in the coastal city of Sidon. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the attacks in a statement today, saying they are counter to both international efforts to de-escalate hostilities and Lebanon’s efforts to extend the government’s authority in areas dominated by Hezbollah. Bassem Mroue and Mohammed Zaatari report for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Ugandan authorities have denied reports that they are planning to cut access to the internet during next week’s election, but the government has banned live broadcasts of riots, “unlawful processions,” and other violent incidents ahead of the election, arguing that these could “escalate tensions and spread panic.” Despite assurances, the main opposition party, the National Unity Platform (NUP), has launched an offline vote-monitoring app in case of a blackout. “As we all know, the regime is plotting an internet shutdown, as they have done in past elections, to block communication and prevent citizens from organising, verifying results, and demanding accountability,” NUP leader Bobi Wine said. Sammy Awami and Jean Otalor report for BBC News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang yesterday unveiled the company’s new Vera Rubin AI chip, which will be shipped to companies later this year. Huang said the chip is designed to fulfil AI requests more quickly and cheaply; companies will be able to train AI models with one quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. Tripp Mickle reports for the New York Times.

The European Commission yesterday said that the images of undressed women and children being shared across Elon Musk’s social media site X via its AI chatbot Grok were unlawful. In the United Kingdom, regulator Ofcom yesterday demanded that X explain how Grok was able to produce undressed images of people and sexualised images of children, and whether it was failing in its legal duty to protect users.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Homeland Security Department yesterday accused the Hilton hotel company of a “coordinated campaign” to refuse service to its law enforcement officers in Minneapolis by “maliciously” cancelling reservations. The DHS social media post included an image of an email that stated the property would not host immigration agents. Christine Chung reports for the New York Times.

The United States yesterday reached a deal with Dominica to start sending people seeking asylum in the United States to the Caribbean nation, according to Dominica’s Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit. Last month, the Trump administration announced it was expanding travel restrictions to 20 additional countries, including Dominica. Anselm Gibbs reports for AP News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Defense Department has initiated proceedings to demote Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) from a retired Navy captain to a lower rank, with a corresponding reduction in pay, in response to his video warning service members not to follow illegal orders, Hegseth said yesterday. Leo Shane III and Connor O’Brien report for POLITICO.

The Trump administration plans to freeze $10 billion in funding for child care subsidies, social services, and cash support for low-income families in five Democratic-led states, according to Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon. Around $7 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program will be cut off in Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois, and Colorado. “Democrat-led states and governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” Nixon said. “Under the Trump administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes.” Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

The Homeland Security Department has drafted plans to cut the Federal Emergency Management Agency Workforce in 2026 through potential reductions of thousands of disaster response and recovery roles, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. Emails sent to senior agency leadership in late December include detailed tables identifying roles that can be cut from the agency’s divisions. These tables include a 41 per cent reduction in CORE disaster roles, more than 4,300 positions. In a statement, FEMA spokesperson Daniel Llargués said the agency has “not issued and is not implementing a percentage-based workforce reduction.” Brianna Sacks reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday ruled that the Trump administration could not make drastic cuts to the federal funding supporting much of the country’s medical and scientific research, reaffirming a lower court’s ruling. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

197 plaintiffs on Friday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of casework by the Homeland Security Department and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is not authorized by immigration or administrative law. Brittany Gibson reports for Axios.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which began ramping up arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Minneapolis area in early December, will be sending 1,500 deportation officers from Enforcement and Removal Operations as well as 600 agents from Homeland Security Investigations, the officials said. Some of the officers and agents began arriving Sunday, one of the officials said.

The surge stems from a viral video that alleged Somali-run day cares were receiving federal subsidies but that no children were present.

As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services cut funding to day cares in Minnesota and put restrictions on federal subsidies to day cares serving low-income children nationwide.

But the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said its investigators conducted on-site compliance checks at nine of the 10 facilities. One of the facilities had closed in 2022.

“Investigators confirmed the centers were operating as expected, gathered evidence and initiated further review. Children were present at all sites except one—that site, was not yet open for families for the day when inspectors arrived,” the agency, which oversees day cares in Minnesota, said in a statement.

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced via X that she was sending agents from Homeland Security Investigations to begin door knocking more than 30 businesses to root out fraud in the Somali community.

One of the DHS officials told NBC News the 600 additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations will be largely focused on identifying possible fraud. Deportation officers will be making arrests of immigrants in the area who are allegedly violating immigration law, the official said.

It's unclear whether the Border Patrol might also add forces to join ICE in operations in Minneapolis. One of the DHS officials said Border Patrol official Greg Bovino — who oversaw operations in Chicago; Charlotte, North Carolina; and New Orleans — may soon be arriving in Minneapolis along with Noem.

A spokeswoman for DHS did not respond to questions about Noem and Bovino’s plans to travel to Minneapolis.

In a post on Instagram, ICE said a Hilton hotel in Minneapolis had canceled reservations for ICE agents upon finding out their stay was related to immigration enforcement in the area.

“After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation. You should see a proper cancellation email in your inbox shortly from Hilton,” the email posted by ICE said.

Hilton said that the hotel was independently owned and operated, that the actions “are not reflective of Hilton’s values” and that they are investigating the matter.

The hotel, run by Everpeak Hospitality, says that the move was “inconsistent with our policy” and that it is making sure affected guests are accommodated.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251211-home-entry-ice-ride-along-gk-57183b.jpg",N,,2026-01-06 09:57:59.574023

Trump has a long history with Minnesota, Somali community The child care fraud scandal has reignited the president’s persistent hostility toward Somalis.","Around 2,000 federal agents are being deployed to Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration’s latest effort to crack down on immigration, two law enforcement officials told CNN, while the city and its officials are reeling from a welfare fraud scandal that’s reaching a fever pitch this week.

In the days since a conservative content creator raised allegations of fraud in a YouTube video – with little evidence – about Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis, the Trump administration has frozen federal child care funds and unleashed more biting rhetoric against the Somali community, whom President Donald Trump has previously called “garbage.”

Now, the president is stepping up immigration enforcement. Federal agents have already been on the ground in Minneapolis, and both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and US Border Patrol agents are deploying to Minnesota. US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, whose controversial tactics have come under increased scrutiny in multiple cities, is also expected to deploy there.

Uncertainty is sweeping Minnesota’s largest city as the fraud allegations prompt shakeups in local leadership, and a new, ambiguous immigration enforcement effort intimidating Somali residents has emerged. Here’s what we know.

Deployment comes as Walz drops reelection bid

The mobilization of more agents to Minneapolis comes as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who has been staunchly opposed to Trump’s deployment of troops to US cities, dropped out of the race for reelection on Monday.

The welfare-fraud scandal in his state has intensified into a political flashpoint seized upon by Trump, and its deepening federal probe complicated Walz’s bid for an unprecedented third term. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but Republicans have sought to blame Walz and Democrats for abuse of taxpayer dollars.

It was the recent criticism from the Trump administration and right-wing allies that Walz said contributed to his decision not to seek reelection.

“For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of this state’s generosity,” Walz said. “And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of a crisis.”

Walz had been criticized for his administration’s oversight of the welfare programs. Several Democrats in the state privately cautioned Walz against seeking reelection as outrage intensified in Minnesota and beyond over the misuse of funds.

In his brief appearance on Monday, Walz said he welcomed the federal investigation. He said it was imperative Minnesotans had confidence in the state’s social safety net programs.

Pushback anticipated over familiar ICE operation targeting Somalis

The 2,000 agent surge isn’t the first time federal immigration authorities have targeted the Twin Cities. In December, following Trump’s disparaging comments about Somalis and calls for them to leave the country, federal agents arrived in Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the president’s wide-spanning deportation campaign.

The operation sparked fear and anxiety for the area’s Somali community, the vast majority of whom are US citizens. Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority — 87% — are naturalized US citizens.

The previous ICE operation sparked protests and tense standoffs with agents. In one incident that drew criticism from the Minneapolis police chief, an agent knelt on a woman’s back as she lay atop a snow bank and then tried to drag her to a car. The episode took place just a few miles from where George Floyd was killed by a city police officer kneeling on his neck in 2020.

Americans of Somali descent told CNN they started carrying their passports and ID cards with them, scared they would be stopped by federal agents.

This time around, DHS said it has run into trouble booking hotel rooms in Minneapolis for newly mobilized agents. It alleged that global hotel chain Hilton launched a “coordinated campaign” to refuse service to agents by cancelling their room reservations in Minneapolis as the agency readies for escalated immigration enforcement there.

Screenshots DHS posted on X on Monday afternoon appear to show emails from a Hilton address stating that immigration agents are not allowed to stay at the Hampton Inn Lakeville property, located in a suburb south of Minneapolis.

“After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation. You should see a proper cancellation email in your inbox shortly from Hilton,” one email reads.

The Lakeville Hilton property is independently owned and operated by Everpeak Hospitality, which said in a statement on its website that the incident “was inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all,” and that it is “in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin rejected that statement, writing on X Monday evening that DHS and ICE haven’t heard from Everpeak Hospitality.

Hilton itself, in an initial statement Monday, emphasized that the independently owned and operated hotel’s actions “were not reflective of Hilton values.”

On Tuesday Hilton issued a new statement, saying it had further concerns that the Lakeview Hilton property was “not meeting our standards,” and Hilton was therefore taking “immediate action” to remove the hotel from its system.

“Hilton is - and has always been - a welcoming place for all. We are also engaging with all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again,” Hilton’s Tuesday statement said.

Friday deadline looms amid frozen child care payments

On December 30, Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill announced the agency was freezing all child care payments to Minnesota amid the fraud allegations. The state typically receives about $185 million annually in federal child care funding, supporting care for 19,000 children.

Investigators last week visited all of the child care centers accused of fraud in the video, and all were operating as expected, state officials say. Still, investigations into alleged wrongdoing are ongoing.

The state Department of Children, Youth, and Families announced Monday it would conduct additional on-site compliance checks at child care centers across the state.

“Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,” O’Neill said. He said he had demanded Walz provide a “comprehensive audit” of the centers featured in the video.

The proof must be shared with the government by Friday, according to an email from state officials to child care providers. The email said HHS has requested specific details, including the total amount of Child Care and Development Fund payments received by five child care centers and administrative data – like names and social security numbers – for all recipients of federal money.

The fund is the main source of federal support for child care and includes the state Child Care Assistance Program, which Nick Shirley, the creator of the viral video, alleged was being exploited in Minnesota.

In the meantime, thousands of Minnesota families who rely on federal child care funding are in limbo. It is unclear how quickly funding could be restored if the state meets the Friday deadline.

Trump has a long history with Minnesota, Somali community

The child care fraud scandal has reignited the president’s persistent hostility toward Somalis. For years, he has attacked Somalis living in the US, Somalia itself, and Somali leaders like Rep. Ilhan Omar, who he has said should not be allowed to serve in Congress.

Somalia was also on the travel ban list during Trump’s first presidential term. Under the Obama administration, several Muslim-majority nations, including Somalia, were identified as “countries of concern” and subject to travel restrictions. Somalia had been added to address “the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters,” according to a DHS statement. When Trump took office, the restrictions turned into a travel ban.

He continued the attacks Sunday when asked about the Minnesota fraud scandal, insulting Omar and going on a tangent about Somali pirates, while criticizing “astronomical” theft of government funds.

Somalis and their advocates point out the small group of people charged with fraud don’t reflect their thousands-strong community.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Minnesota chapter, says there’s a clear motif when isolated instances of wrongdoing are used to scapegoat an entire population.

“Each time, the same pattern emerges: isolate a case, generalize it to an entire group, and use fear to legitimize discrimination,” Hussein said.

“The Somali community in the Twin Cities is overwhelmingly made up of hardworking families, small business owners, health care workers, students, and taxpayers who contribute every day to Minnesota’s economy and civic life,” he said.

Allegations reach halls of Congress this week

The fraud allegations will reach new heights in the halls of Congress this week as Minnesota state lawmakers are set to testify in Washington, DC, on Wednesday before the Republican-led US House Oversight Committee.

The hearing, focused on “fraud and misuse of federal funds,” will feature testimony from three Republican members of the Minnesota House of Representatives who, the chairman of the Oversight Committee says, “sounded the alarm” on the fraud: Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson and Marion Rarick.

James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, invited Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to testify in a separate hearing before the committee’s investigative panel on February 10, saying the governor “ignored” warnings of fraud from the state lawmakers.

Gov. Ron DeSantis announced plans to build another facility to hold ICE detainees, after he said that the state's current detention facility in South Florida, nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz"", is a temporary facility.

What we know:

In a Jan. 5 press conference, Gov. Ron DeSantis spoke about the state's successes in detaining undocumented immigrants within state borders. Under ""Operation Tidal Wave,"" DeSantis said over 10,000 undocumented immigrants were arrested and turned over to the Department of Homeland Security. Among the 10,000, 63% had criminal arrests or convictions, including violent and sex offenders.

Apart from ""Operation Tidal Wave,"" joint efforts from Florida counties contributed to 20,000 arrests. All of Florida's 67 counties have 287(g) agreements – deputizing officers to act as ICE officers by arresting and detaining individuals for immigration violations.

DeSantis praised the ""meaningful results"" and said the state has ""good momentum.""

Expanding Florida ICE detention centers

DeSantis said that Florida is hoping to help DHS with capacity and has a few potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center locations in mind.

""We’re looking to help, and we’re going to get reimbursed on this,"" he said in front of the ""Deportation Depot"" in Sanderson on Monday.

DeSantis said he's planning a ""Panhandle-Pokey,"" which will be located in Northwest Florida, but is waiting for approval from DHS – upon which the state will be reimbursed.

DeSantis said DHS didn't have capacity for ICE detainees, so the state offered potential locations and were reimbursed.

If DHS doesn’t approve the new center, then ""we’ll stand by,"" he said. ""I think it should be approved, because I don’t think that they’re where they need to be on detention space.""

Another potential option is in Southern Florida, he said. They’re working on several options, he said.

Florida's Everglades detention facility, ""Alligator Alcatraz"", is a temporary facility, DeSantis said. Its airstrip saves time when flying people out, but they had to build a lot of temporary things in the area, he explained.

""It’s clearly temporary. How temporary will depend on the pace that they have in terms of doing the expansion,"" DeSantis said. ""We would anticipate that at some point they're going to up their own capacity.""

Where are Florida's ICE detention centers?

In Florida, ICE's website lists five locations used as detention facilities, field centers or processing centers.

Baker County. Located at the former Baker Correctional Institution, the Baker County Detention Center, also dubbed the ""Deportation Depot"" in Sanderson opened in August 2025 and has the capacity to hold over 1,300 detainees. Ninety-three deportation flights have left the facility that's been operating for four months, DeSantis said – deporting over 2,000 individuals.

But while Trump’s deportation machine had explosive growth, its reach hasn’t lived up to Wall Street expectations. Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected.

Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system — and privately run holding facilities — expected to grow even larger.

“Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up.”

On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department — though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Contractors like GEO Group and its primary competitor, CoreCivic, welcomed the news. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes.

At the beginning of 2025, the companies had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group, based near Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s home in Florida, seemed particularly well-suited.

“This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments — in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring — to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” George Zoley, the Greek-born founder of GEO Group, said during a quarterly earnings call in February.

By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement.

Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America.

“Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst.

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport 1 million people a year. In December, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, claimed it had deported 605,000 people since Trump was elected and that an additional 1.9 million people self-deported. The department dangled financial carrots like a “free flight home for Christmas and $1,000.”

Immigrant arrests climbed. In December, ICE detained 68,000 people nationwide, up from about 40,000 at the beginning of the year. That’s more than ever before on record, yet only a quarter of those people had been convicted of a crime, including low-level offenses. Another 25% had criminal cases pending.

Detention capacity is still far from ICE’s stated goal of having access to more than 100,000 beds at a time to detain immigrants.

Early last year, GEO Group said it expected to provide 32,000 beds for ICE, more than double the amount at the end of the Biden administration. In doing so, the firm told investors that it was likely that all of its idle prisons would be activated by the end of the year.

GEO Group resumed admitting immigrants at its 1,940-bed Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California after a COVID ban was lifted. On the East Coast, in Newark, New Jersey, GEO Group’s 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility opened with the help of an ICE contract valued at $1 billion. In the Midwest, North Lake Processing Center, a notorious 1,800-bed facility in Baldwin, Michigan, also opened.

As of Dec. 15, GEO Group had idle facilities with nearly 4,700 empty beds in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas, according to its report to investors.

CoreCivic also ramped up, but not as quickly as investors expected. Notably, in March, the Tennessee-based firm said it resumed “operations and care” for up to 2,400 people, including families, at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in South Texas, a contract expected to generate $180 million in annual revenue.

“Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger, a former correctional officer himself, said during an earnings call in May.

At the end of September, CoreCivic reported that it had idle facilities with more than 7,000 empty beds.

Adding pressure to stock prices, the federal government apprehended fewer people at the U.S. southern border, lowering the number of new arrivals to detain or monitor. Still, in December, GEO Group touted that the “alien population” in the United States holds strong at 16.8 million, citing a figure from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit seeking to reduce immigration. GEO Group also said that 182,000 people were being monitored in the community for ICE’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (down from about 370,000 under the Biden administration).

Zoley said GEO Group subsidiary BI Incorporated could scale up its monitoring contract to serve millions of people for ICE.

The Trump administration is also still ramping up. And investors and observers expect the system to keep growing this year.

“As they expand their infrastructure — that includes officers, buildings, fleets, buses, planes, technology — then that’s when we are probably going to see more people, more numbers captured into all of this,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a national human rights nonprofit that monitors the prison industry.

Join the community that keeps criminal justice on the front page.

The Department of Homeland Security recently signed a $140 million contract to buy planes from Boeing for deportations. Thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents are being recruited, with others offered $50,000 signing bonuses to come out of retirement. More local police and sheriff departments have formal agreements to support national immigration enforcement efforts.

The White House and ICE see publicly traded private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic as “allies and assets” to their ongoing efforts to deport many more people, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“The contractors are the consequence of the policy choice made by this administration,” he said.

And as a libertarian, he said he views illegal immigration as the consequence of a broken immigration system. He described the Trump administration’s immigration policy as “indiscriminate mass deportation.”

“If you go down the list, it’s hard to find a right that they haven’t violated in the Constitution,” he said. “I find it incredibly troubling that they are getting away with it so far.”

He said trying to open 100,000 ICE detention beds nationwide is an “absurd goal” that has required the government to arrest people for a far broader set of reasons than previous administrations have used.

“There aren’t enough criminal immigrants in the United States that they can catch to fill those facilities, so this is all about caging a bunch of peaceful people who aren’t bothering anyone,” Bier said.

He expects the Trump administration to surpass its detention bed goal.

“They could easily be at 200,000 by the end of this term,” he said. “The main limitation would just be the personnel to man that. You have to find actual people willing to do this work. But in terms of just paying for it, they got way more money than they could possibly spend on this.”

Gomes, the analyst, said that as ICE brings more people into work, it could improve the financial results of GEO Group and CoreCivic.

“As those employees come on, you will see the number of detentions increase,” he said.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/S_vyipQ71nG2K8vqfKNgo5KnXavBgl4XEmUit4A6U78/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9ocHZzYnpuMWNj/MDE0a29pOXZpaW56/N290dHN5L0dFVFRZ/X01BUktFVC1ERVRF/TlRJT05fYWRlbGFu/dG9fZGV0ZW50aW9u/X2NlbnRlcl8yNTEy/MjIuanBn,N,,2026-01-06 09:58:03.386458

I have one question right now: What is America doing in Venezuela? Over the weekend, on Jan. 3, the Trump administration launched an operation that ended with the capture of Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela.

We’ve heard a lot of reasons from the Trump administration about why they decided to do this: Maduro is not a good guy. He’s an oppressive, brutal dictator who has made the lives of many people miserable. But there are a lot of brutal, repressive dictators in this world.

Venezuela is not a leading supplier in America’s fentanyl crisis.

Venezuela’s oil reserves are not an easy source of future wealth or power for the United States. (And oil should not be a reason to invade another country anyway.)

President Donald Trump ran for office promising fewer foreign entanglements. He wanted to be remembered as a peacemaker.

So what are we doing, watching President Trump stand onstage, saying: America is now running Venezuela? That the people standing behind him are now running Venezuela? And then watching Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and interim national security adviser, try to walk that back?

This was a profound gamble from the Trump administration. Trump ran for office this time promising an end to these kinds of gambles, criticizing those that previous presidents had made in the past.

So what are the arguments, views, interests, factions that led America to this point? And what comes after it?

Joining me is Jonathan Blitzer, who has covered immigration and the Trump administration in Central America for The New Yorker. He has profiled Stephen Miller and gone deep into the drug-boat bombings the Trump administration has been executing. He is also the author of the excellent book “Everyone Who Is Gone is Here: The United States, Central America and the Making of a Crisis.”

Ezra Klein: Jonathan Blitzer, welcome to the show.

Jonathan Blitzer: Thanks for having me.

Who is Nicolás Maduro? How should we understand what he represents and was?

Maduro has always been, to my mind, a middling figure who attached himself to his predecessor, Hugo Chávez — who was a transformative, obviously highly controversial figure in Venezuela, who nationalized the oil industry, who made improving the lives of the poor a central plank of his political agenda but also consolidated power in all kinds of ways, flirted with violating the Constitution, and so on.

Maduro was essentially a member of that administration and became Chávez’s appointed successor when Chávez became sick with cancer and died. So Maduro took power in 2013 but never had the charisma of Chávez. Almost immediately when he took office, you had things start to change the fortunes of the country. You had the price of oil drop. There was an economic crisis. You started to have an increase in inflation that got steadily worse in the 2010s. You started to have a series of domestic flare-ups of mass protests, which Maduro responded to by cracking down on the population in increasingly aggressive ways. This was in 2014 and again in 2017.

In 2015, the Venezuelan opposition won congressional elections and it seemed like they could really bring Maduro to heel. The response of Maduro and his inner circle was to essentially invalidate that victory of the opposition in Congress and to go on to try to neuter the power of the opposition. And what we saw in the years since was an increasingly brutal consolidation of power.

So he’s someone who was always a weak personal replacement to Chávez, who channeled all of Chávez’s darkest, most repressive urges and has basically been at the helm during a period where the country has really disintegrated in many ways.

Since 2014, you have close to 8 million Venezuelans who have fled the country. That’s all during Maduro’s time as leader.

Donald Trump has been talking about deposing Nicolás Maduro since his first term. Why? And why didn’t it happen then?

The most interesting thing to those of us following Trump’s stance on this issue during his first term was that there were real hawks and hard-liners in his first administration who were pushing for more aggressive direct action in Venezuela and in the region — and the person who was uncomfortable moving forward was Trump. He was skeptical of the idea of putting boots on the ground. He was skeptical of the idea of overextending American involvement in the region. So probably the most striking thing has been his change from Trump 1.0 to Trump 2.0.

But the Venezuela issue has always loomed large for him. Part of that is just purely political: The South Florida Republican Latino community — which is obviously very important to him and is important among a lot of his supporters and administration members — has always really been fixated on Venezuela. They see the Venezuelan regime as being the key to unlocking the downfall of socialist regimes across the region — in Cuba, above all, but also in Nicaragua.

So there has always been a real appetite for high-flying, saber-rattling rhetoric on the issue. Trump initially understood the priority of Venezuela in those terms — as a political imperative.

But the idea that we did this for political support in southern Florida doesn’t track for me. There have been too many players involved. Donald Trump is not running for re-election again — probably.

What were the conceptions of American interests at play?

There’s no question that oil is a huge interest for Trump and something that he’s always been fixated on.

It bothered him, and it bothered people in his inner circle, that Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, nationalized large parts of the country’s oil sector and essentially forced out American and international companies in the 2000s.

So there’s been this idea that American capitalist interests have been dispossessed and that it’s a matter of recouping what was lost. There’s a sense of opportunity there.

I also think that he’s someone who has grand designs for asserting American influence in the region as a reflection of his political power.

The Venezuela issue has always been an opportunity for him to do that on a big international stage, to really be the bully that he’s wanted to be.

Tell me about the oil and geopolitics side of this. Because that does seem to have been quite compelling to Trump himself.

The thing that I’ve heard is that inside the administration there was tension from the very start of the current term. On the one hand, there were hard-liners like Rubio and that broader delegation of Rubio-aligned members of Congress wanting the administration to take increasingly aggressive action against Venezuela, and roll back some of the easing of the sanctions done during the Biden administration.

The Biden administration created a special exception for Chevron to continue to do some measure of business in Venezuela. And it seems like, at a certain point, the threat was made to Trump that these members of Congress would block or drag their feet on the so-called “big, beautiful bill,” his big domestic spending bill, if he didn’t chart a harder course against Venezuela.

So, in one sense, he was responsive to all of those things and conscious of the need for everyone to be in lock step, particularly around that big domestic spending bill.

At the same time, he was very concerned about the idea of Chevron losing its foothold at a time when a lot of observers will point out that the U.S. hard line against Venezuela has allowed other countries like Russia, Iran and China to establish increasing influence, both in Venezuela and over the Venezuelan oil industry.

So there was this plan to try to manage both things. And I think in some ways, the aggression that we’ve seen is an outgrowth of the administration trying to square that particular circle.

Trump ostensibly acceded to the demands made by hard-line anti-Maduro Republicans in Congress to continue to keep these sanctions, to roll back some of the Biden administration allowances on Chevron’s activity in the region.

Then, by the time that bill had passed, by the end of July, you have the White House signing this legal memorandum to essentially justify, or at least set in motion, the start of these boat bombings.

So I think Trump thinks very actively about the oil issue. What’s unclear to me is what he’s hearing from advisers about the difficulty of propping back up the Venezuelan oil industry.

The big problem has been that Venezuela is responsible for less than 1 percent of the world’s overall oil output. It’s producing half of what it used to produce per day in the ’90s. So re-establishing the industry is going to require a huge amount ——

I’ve seen things like $60 billion of investment, over a long period of time, in a place where we don’t know its long-term stability. We don’t know what Venezuela is going to look like after this in five or 10 years.

The track record of deposing the leader we don’t like, and everything is going to be stable and aligned to American interests for the foreseeable future, is not great.

American oil companies, by the way, are extraordinarily risk averse. It’s not lost on them. First of all, the Iraq example is looming large in their minds. But also, all of these questions about the long-term American plan for Venezuela — that no one really can answer — militate against these companies getting involved in the oil sector right now, given the unpredictability of what’s ahead.

You’ve talked about this as, in part, a Stephen Miller theory — that there is an effort to establish what one might call deterrence or fear among every leader in the Western Hemisphere, and that Venezuela was, for a variety of reasons, the best example to use.

When we talk about Venezuela, we’re not really just talking about Venezuela. We’re talking about making an example of Venezuela such that every other leader in Latin America acts differently when Trump rattles his saber in the future.

That’s exactly right. That’s always been the case with Venezuela. When we talk about Venezuela, we’re never just talking about Venezuela.

One former Trump official said to me at the start of the boat bombings late last year that, insofar as any foreign government was looking at those bombings and scratching their heads and wondering: What is the message here? Is this going to come around for us? — well, mission accomplished. If the idea is to scare everyone and to make everyone feel that Trump is crazy enough to do anything, then his actions are achieving some desired effect.

The interesting thing about Miller’s involvement in this is — as someone who covered the administration during the first Trump term ——

And profiled Stephen Miller.

And spent a lot of time trying to understand Miller’s role in the government then and now — is that he was not someone who was anywhere near this issue during Trump 1.0, which is unsurprising to those who know Stephen Miller as Trump’s immigration adviser and a hard-liner on domestic issues.

What I think has changed, and what’s been interesting to see this go-round, is how Miller has inserted himself into this space.

When this current administration took shape and you saw someone like Marco Rubio as secretary of state, I think it stood to reason that the administration was going to take a series of very aggressive actions in the region, and specifically vis-à-vis Venezuela, because Rubio has always been a really ideological player in this space, both when he was a senator and obviously now.

He’s someone who has always seen the Maduro regime as illegitimate — which he’s not wrong to do, particularly after Maduro lost the 2024 election and declared himself the winner. But going back years and years, Rubio has always had an ax to grind with the Cuban government. He has always been among the hardest-line Republicans on these issues, although he’s particularly well versed in them.

So he’s a complicated player in all of this. It’s unsurprising that a Trump administration with Rubio as secretary of state would be angling for regime change in Venezuela. But what I think has surprised me is the degree to which Miller’s putting his thumb on the scale for intervention changed the development of the administration’s position in the late summer of last year.

Miller is chiefly obsessed with immigration. And to someone like Miller, the situation in Venezuela is responsible for a huge influx of Venezuelan migrants that really exploded during the years of the Biden administration. So it’s not surprising that he would be interested in the region in that way. But another thing that he’s always really fantasized about was using increasingly broad military-style powers for the president to crack down on immigration enforcement in the United States. And the Venezuela issue represents a nexus for him and to that way of thinking.

One of the first things the administration did in 2025 was invoke the Alien Enemies Act, an extremely obscure 18th-century law that basically has only ever been invoked during wartime.

The United States, obviously, at the start of 2025, was not in any war. And yet the logic that Miller put forward, and that the administration adopted, was to say that mass migration represented a kind of hostile foreign invasion. That was defined primarily in terms of Venezuela.

So a lot of the most aggressive immigration actions taken in the United States were taken over the last year and a half in reference to Maduro, in reference to the idea that he posed some sort of hostile threat to the United States.

In fact, the whole premise of Miller’s thinking was that if we bomb these boats and if the Venezuelan government reacts harshly, then we can make some kind of claim that we are in a state of open hostility with this country, and therefore need to take more dramatic action within the country.

You have 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States with temporary protected status. You have at least 100,000 other Venezuelans who came into the United States during the Biden years through a parole program, which was always going to leave them in a precarious position because that was just a program designed to get them into the country lawfully. They would then have to apply for some more-lasting status. Those people are living in an intense sort of limbo right now. A lot of their work authorizations have been canceled. So I think the Venezuelan population in the United States has always been a very ripe target.

It should be said of Miller: He’s smart. The Venezuelan population is really ripe to be exploited because they’re people who had arrived recently, in the last couple of years, who are on the legal fringes with status that will eventually expire.

The last thing I’ll say is something that I was guilty of dismissing a bit during the Biden years. I found myself in conversations with congressional Republicans during the Biden years who spoke very seriously about the idea of the U.S. bombing fentanyl labs in Mexico. I kind of rolled my eyes and thought it was a lark and just a bit of high-flying rhetoric while they were in the political opposition. It’s something that Trump had openly spoken about during his first term, and they were basically brought to heel by various establishment players like the Department of Defense ——

Well, very specifically, the secretary of defense.

Correct.

That gets to something I want to talk a little bit about. We’re bringing in the staffing here. Every administration action is an emergent property of the people around the president and the president himself.

Tell me just a little bit about the difference between the staffing coalitions here in Trump 1.0 and Trump 2.0, and the way those conversations ended up playing out.

I think that’s everything. I think you’re right to identify that. The one response I get from everyone who had been involved in this issue during Trump 1.0 — which, ironically, includes people who ideologically are more predisposed to interventionism and regime change than some of the current players — is that in Trump 1.0, there was this constant sense: OK, key elements of the Defense Department are going to say we can’t do this.

A former high-ranking State Department official during Trump 1.0 said to me yesterday that Trump and the more hawkish members of his cabinet were told on the first go-round that this has never been done before.

That was a refrain that particularly bothered a lot of the real Trump loyalists, that they were told: No. You want to do this transformative thing, but it’s just not done.

That was taken as a taunt and a challenge to some degree, certainly for someone like Miller. But that was the bottom line.

And interestingly, in the current configuration of his advisers, there’s no one who could impose a meaningful check on Trump’s worst impulses — or on Miller’s worst impulses. The one person who represents a more establishment-grounded-type voice also happens to be one of the most ideological people in the administration on this particular issue — Marco Rubio.

That said, interestingly, at the start of the current administration, Miller brought up this idea of bombing fentanyl labs in Mexico. It was something that brought together all of his pet projects and ideological and, frankly, racial obsessions: the idea that the Mexican government was allowing cartels to export people and drugs into the United States.

He was essentially told: This would be counterproductive in all of these ways. We actually have a pretty strong working relationship with the current Mexican administration. It’s not a relationship the Mexican government wants to tout particularly, but they’re doing everything we want them to do. They’ve helped us with drug interdiction. They’ve helped us increase enforcement along the border — all of these traditional things that the Mexican government has actually taken a very active role in doing behind the scenes. Why would we openly provoke them? They’re our largest trading partner. There would just be catastrophic downstream consequences if we were to take this kind of action there.

So even in the current administration, that message was sent to someone like Miller. His response essentially was: OK, well, let’s find somewhere else to bomb.

They didn’t just find somewhere else to bomb — they found something else to bomb.

This has been one of the strangest dimensions of the arguments around Venezuela: the high-profile bombing of the drug boats.

America has a profound fentanyl problem, and fentanyl comes from, among other places, China and Mexico. Fentanyl is very hard to stop because it is such a potent, synthesized, concentrated molecule that pocket-size amounts can — and do — kill huge numbers of Americans.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration appears to have moved to bombing cocaine smuggling. I’m not saying cocaine is great, but it was not a major issue in either the 2020 or 2024 election that America has a huge cocaine problem.

So there has been this weird movement from: We have this big fentanyl problem, and we need to do something about it. To now: We’re bombing these boats that are allegedly smuggling cocaine.

It’s perplexing.

It’s perplexing if you try to disentangle it logically. It is extraordinarily cynical.

Someone at the Defense Department had told me that, quite literally, the rationale was: We want to do something kinetic — the phrase they all love to use is “kinetic.” We want to do something that’s never been done before. We want to show that Trump is stronger and more serious than any of his predecessors. We’ll literally pick a different target.

The bombing of those boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific is exactly that. To your point, the president comes out and says this is an act of self-defense, that drug overdoses are up, there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who have died ——

They’ve actually fallen recently.

That’s true.

But drug overdoses are high and a genuinely disastrous problem. But from fentanyl, primarily.

One hundred percent. And as everyone points out, if you look at Coast Guard data, none of this is coming through the Caribbean. What’s more, the cocaine that’s coming through the Caribbean and the eastern part of the Pacific tends to have its destination as European cities, not American ones.

So I don’t think there was any serious, substantive point behind selecting these targets as a matter of curbing the drug trade. I think it had a lot more to do with asserting a new, raw power and sending a broader message. But, yes, it’s utterly perplexing. It’s in many ways nonsensical.

I have to say: Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the ex-president of Honduras, who was charged and convicted in almost precisely the same way, short of the kind of military intervention that extracted Maduro from Venezuela. But he was someone who was charged in the Southern District of New York and was also held in Brooklyn. The people at the Department of Justice who worked on those charging documents and those investigations go back to Trump’s first term.

One of the most prominent players in that investigation in the Southern District of New York was a guy named Emil Bove, who was a prosecutor in that division during Trump 1.0 and then eventually became Trump’s personal lawyer. He then served at a high level at the start of Trump’s second term in the Department of Justice and has since been nominated and confirmed as an appellate court judge.

He was largely involved in helping prepare that research, showing how Juan Orlando Hernández had been involved in the drug trade. There wasn’t a lot of controversy around the charges brought against him.

Nevertheless, Trump, at the end of November, in a move that, frankly, is inexplicable in every sense, pardoned him.

I still don’t understand how that happened. You don’t, either? You’re telling me that you don’t have an explanation?

There is what Trump himself said, which is that this was a Biden frame-up because technically Hernández was convicted and sentenced during the Biden years. Again, that flies in the face of everything we know about how the case against Hernández was built during the first Trump administration.

Hernández, at a certain point, wrote an obsequious letter to Trump that Roger Stone delivered to him, basically comparing both of them to victims of American justice run amok.

None of these things justify the pardoning of Hernández — least of all at a time when the current administration is saying the reason they ousted Maduro from power and brought him to the United States for trial is because he’s a narco-terrorist. These are exactly the same charges brought against Hernández.

So it pretty much voids any pretense that American interests right now in Venezuela have to do with stemming the drug trade. The randomness of how the administration shifted from a not illegitimate concern about fentanyl labs in parts of Mexico, say, to the indiscriminate bombing of small drug boats in the Caribbean is really a product of a political calculation, above all.

Well, you say what they want to do is something “kinetic,” which is the Orwellian way that violence gets described in military action.

Yes.

It seems to me that what they wanted to do was something that was a spectacle. There is a certain amount of governing or propagandizing or signal sending through spectacle.

With the release of the drone videos — you see the eradication and killing of these people on these boats — they were looking for something that was televisual. They were looking for something that worked as vertical video on X. The photos of the makeshift situation room at Mar-a-Lago during this operation have a huge screen showing X with a search for Venezuela on it. The photos they released of Maduro — the whole thing seems so built around spectacle.

I think you have to see this as “propaganda through force.” That might have been one of your pieces or, certainly, in somebody’s piece that I read in preparing for this.

Exactly. That was a phrase used by a former Trump administration official in describing this.

It’s also worth pointing out what was happening in the United States at the time, at the start of these boat bombings. There was also an increased militarization in American cities like Los Angeles and Chicago related to this immigration crackdown.

One thing that a number of officials have made the point to me, and I think it’s well taken, is that the general logic here is making military action a daily presence in American life in every sense. As you say, it’s visual, it’s kind of atmospheric. So this was all happening simultaneously.

The strangeness, to my mind, about how Venezuela emerges as this particular target that serves all of these different political ends is that there were different factions within the Trump administration that actually had different views on how the United States should engage with Venezuela.

It’s a genuinely complicated question. You have a repressive, dictatorial president who does have ties to the drug trade — there’s no question — who refused to recognize a democratic election, who has done all of these obviously horrific crimes. How do you engage with him?

There are longstanding sanctions. Those sanctions seem to be immiserating the population but haven’t really dislodged Maduro himself from power. Previous diplomatic efforts have all run up against the bottom line that Maduro would never negotiate his own ouster. That has always been a diplomatic catch in any broader design for the region.

So there was an element within the Trump administration early on that favored a more conciliatory approach. It was epitomized by Richard Grenell, a special envoy who flew down to Caracas, met with Maduro, and achieved some small successes. For example, he got the Venezuelan government to release Americans held in Venezuelan prisons and convinced the Venezuelan government to start accepting deportation flights from the United States.

So there were these incremental achievements or gains made from that more conciliatory approach. But someone like Grenell was quickly outgunned by the combination of Rubio and his ideological vision for the region and regime change, and people like Miller, who brought these other concerns to the issue.

It’s kind of a weird confluence of the different interests of people at play, such that this becomes a kind of natural target. And the one through line, I would say, given the differences among the various actors involved inside the administration, was the question: At the end of the day, what would the fallout actually be for the administration if it started to take increasingly aggressive action against Venezuela?

Maduro is an international pariah. Venezuela is not a country that’s contiguous with the United States in the way that Mexico is.

Not to make this sound too simple, but I have to say I’ve been struck in some of my conversations with people on the inside describing that the thinking was boiling down to: Can this really hurt us that badly? As if this is a perfect theater for us to experiment in these ways because the blowback won’t be as substantial as it would be elsewhere.

The Trump administration has described what they think could go right here — which is that you have a pliant government in Venezuela that does what we want them to do, which leads to more oil exports, which leads to fewer migrant outflows.

It seems like a tall order. But what could go wrong here? If we’re looking back in a couple of years, and this looks like a signal catastrophe, what happened?

I would say there are two ways of grouping the categories of what could go wrong — because there’s just a vast amount of things that could go wrong.

The first would be: Let’s say Maduro has been removed and now the administration has elevated a hard-liner in Delcy Rodríguez to this new role as interim president. In this world, where the U.S. now basically begs off or drifts away, you have a regime in Venezuela that is even harder line, that’s been backed into a corner, that’s going to crack down in even new ways on the Venezuelan population that’s there. And what you’ve effectively done is you’ve really neutered the political opposition in the country after years of the Venezuelan opposition really trying to assert itself and trying to build a popular mandate.

It has always been a problem for the Venezuelan opposition: finding a way of continuing to seem relevant to the Venezuelan people, when even after they win elections, the government just refuses to recognize those results, and everyone goes back to the status quo.

The Venezuelan opposition leader just won the Nobel Peace Prize and dedicated it to Donald Trump. But Trump just dismissed her, saying that she doesn’t have the juice to run the country.

Dismissed her, yes. That was always the concern for María Corina Machado, the Nobel laureate and leader of the Venezuelan opposition — an incredibly charismatic figure who wasn’t the candidate who stood for election in 2024. She had been barred from running for office. Instead it was someone she backed, a diplomat, an older, statelier diplomat, who I think won in large part because of Machado’s advocacy for him and her presence and her courage.

Her particular gambit has been that the only way to meaningfully get rid of Maduro is to depend on the direct foreign intervention of the United States. But there was always this concern that if you put all of your stock in the idea that the Americans are going to come dislodge the regime and usher in some sort of democratic restoration, when Trump doesn’t do that, you are discredited, and you are marginalized — which seems to be what’s happening.

So the first order of bad outcomes is exactly this: The administration in some form or another persists. The hard-liners continue to exert major influence in the country, relatively unchecked. There are further domestic crackdowns. And the Venezuelan opposition, such as it is, is now completely at sea.

The other universe of possibilities is that there is a power vacuum. Because there’s a careful, precarious balance to how the current situation is persisting: You have a group of armed vigilante groups called colectivos who have essentially operated at the behest of the regime but are in some ways free agents. You have elements of the military who are very paranoid about their standing, who have access, obviously, to weapons, to drugs, to money. You have a contingent of Colombian rebels operating along the border. You have the potential for an immense amount of uncontrolled violence and intense ongoing factionalism. And if you remove one piece from this equation, all hell will break loose.

These are just tamer summaries of some of the possibilities. But the potential outcomes could be quite grave.

Frankly, I don’t know what’s coming. I don’t know what it means for the current administration to say, as it has in explicit terms: If Delcy Rodríguez, the now acting president, doesn’t do what we want her to do, she’ll suffer a fate worse than Maduro’s.

It’s hard to imagine any government, least of all a government full of Chavistas, who have consolidated all of this power for decades now, just acceding to the idea that they’re just puppets of an American administration.

Certainly, when it comes to American intervention in the region, there are a thousand cautionary tales of what it means for the United States to have this kind of prolonged involvement in the country, and what’s more, to take this kind of aggressive military action.

Needless to say, we haven’t talked about the fact that there was no congressional authorization for this.

Incredible violation of international law.

Exactly. Take your pick.

Maduro is a bad guy. He’s a genuinely bad guy. But there are a lot of bad guys leading countries. As Donald Trump has said before, he has exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un.

I don’t want to defend Nicolás Maduro. He is bad. On the other hand, this is clearly not a standard that we are applying across the world.

If we did start applying that — America truly as the world’s policeman — should we go arrest the leader of Saudi Arabia for killing a journalist who was writing for The Washington Post and allegedly hacking him up with a bone saw?

This is your point, too, about the history of American involvement in the wider region in Latin America. The United States government propped up some of the worst actors for decades.

We’re negotiating with Putin right now.

Exactly.

I want to get at a bigger-picture point that reflects the oil, the drugs, the socialist leader of Venezuela and the Marco Rubio domino theory about Cuba.

This feels like a war or an operation, whatever you want to call it, out of the 1980s. Out of a time when the big drug is cocaine. Out of a time when the global economy is dependent on oil as opposed to moving to renewable energy supply chains — which China is racing ahead of us on and Trump is devastating in America. Out of a time when there’s more fear that socialism might be on the rise and be an attractive ideology to people. Nobody is looking at Venezuela as a successful country that might inspire a lot of imitators.

I can run through the constellation of arguments being made in favor of this. But they all have this quality of being adjacent to reality as it is now.

There’s an energy argument, but the energy argument is the one that would have made sense in the ’80s. We are a huge energy exporter at this point. America is not dependent on others. We do not have an energy independence problem. And to the extent we do have a problem with the future, it is that China is wrecking us right now on things like the solar supply chain. The expectation is not that the future will be won by whoever has access to the deepest oil reserves.

Again, fentanyl — not cocaine — is the drug problem.

There just isn’t a huge problem with socialist strongmen taking power all over Latin America. It’s a disaster for the Venezuelan people, but that’s a somewhat different issue from, at least, the American perspective.

There just seems to be something slightly out of time about it.

It’s a great observation. The ’80s overlay is particularly striking to me, too, when you think about the immigration policies coming out of this administration. The hostility to immigrants in general, in many ways, is an attempt to rewrite some of the policies written in the 1980s, like the Refugee Act of 1980. That has been all but gutted. The idea of asylum refugee practice — gone.

One of the great ironies, to me, in Trump’s new view of alliances in the region, is his alliance with Nayib Bukele, the authoritarian president of El Salvador. I’m thinking particularly, among other things, about how when the administration first invoked the Alien Enemies Act, it sent a group of some 250 Venezuelans accused — in almost every case, without basis or evidence — of belonging to this Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison. The Salvadoran government got $5 million to hold them for an indefinite period of time. They were brutally tortured, they were held incommunicado.

To someone like me, who spends a lot of time thinking about the long sweep of American foreign policy and immigration policy and how they’re intertwined over time, it was incredibly striking to see, particularly during the first Trump term, villainizing immigrants on the basis that many of the Central American immigrants who had arrived in the United States in recent years were somehow members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13. Never mind that it began in the United States and was a scourge that defined the region in the early 2000s and led to large numbers of people showing up at the border during the first Trump administration.

Now you have Venezuelans being accused by the government of belonging to a Venezuelan gang. The target has just changed. Now the ally in prosecuting that case, just as it had been in the ’80s, was a hard-line Salvadoran regime in the region that, I think, in some ways, Trump really wants to emulate.

In some sense, it’s ridiculous to suggest that the president of El Salvador right now is a model for Trump, given just his unrivaled power on the world stage. But one of the things that the Salvadoran government has done in recent years has been to basically suspend the constitution and run the country from month to month in what has been called a state of exception. That is almost exactly what the Trump administration fantasizes about in ways both literal and figurative.

So in terms of why that mode of thinking still seems to appeal to Trump and to some of his hard-line ideologues, I can see it as a throwback to an era of American interventionism and unbridled sort of demonstrations of force and power.

There’s been reporting about the fact that Maduro, as an attempt to placate the Trump administration, basically offered his country’s oil up to the administration. The administration refused it, which again raises the question of this being more about a show of force. It’s a very strange thing.

But I think you’re right: A lot of the ideological thinking around this has a kind of hoary, ’80s-era element. If you poke it a little bit further, particularly in the context of Venezuela and this sort of domino theory almost in reverse — if you topple a socialist regime in the region, then others will fall — you really start to see the radicalism of this old hard-line Rubio position on Cuba, which he has not really budged on in his time in public office. He has always been utterly hard-line and stubborn on the question of needing to overthrow the Cuban government. And again, that’s very old-world, backward looking.

I mean, this is not to defend the abuses of the Cuban government, which are obscene in every sense. But it is a mode of thinking that is very dated.

How do you understand who is now running Venezuela?

What Trump and Rubio agree on in their somewhat different statements is that the acting president of Venezuela has to do what we want her to do.

So what do we want her to do?

I don’t exactly know what the U.S. expectation is for Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president.

Have we done a lot of planning about how to run Venezuela?

It does not seem to me to be the case.

Delcy Rodríguez, the acting president of Venezuela, is a strange person for the U.S. to elevate. Delcy Rodríguez is someone who, before Maduro was in power, was basically a middling government bureaucrat during the regime of Chávez.

Her fortunes changed when Maduro came to office. Her brother became the chief political strategist for Maduro, and she, with him, started to have an increasingly active role in overseeing his government.

At a certain point, she was in charge of the foreign ministry. Then she became in charge of the economy and eventually took on the oil portfolio. She was widely regarded as someone who was politically ruthless, someone who was a true believer, one of the most loyal and ideological members of the regime.

Her father had been tortured and killed at the hands of a pro-U.S. Venezuelan administration, and it has been said that she’s always harbored a sense of aggrievement and victimhood as a result of that.

She is, for all of her ruthlessness, also known to have managed somewhat competently under the circumstances in trying — given this terrible hand the country has been dealt economically — to stabilize inflation, trying to increase oil production.

But she’s someone who is deeply implicated in all of the gravest misdeeds of the administration of the regime. For example, her brother was the person responsible basically for forcing through the fraudulent election of 2024.

So she is basically at the center of all of the most controversial elements of the Maduro regime and its actions — and, naturally, during Trump’s first term, was actually sanctioned for this by the Trump administration.

Amazing how things work out.

Yes. As one former Trump administration official told me: If your whole logic has been that Maduro is an illegitimate president and that his regime is illegitimate, what does it mean to remove him and then replace him with his No. 2 — someone who is implicated in every misdeed of the Maduro regime?

I know that there is a complicated problem the administration has to solve, and this has always been on the table — and was always one of the reasons the United States shouldn’t have gotten involved as precipitously as it has — and that is: It’s not clear the best way forward without Maduro.

The Venezuelan opposition won national elections in 2024, but the country is still in the stranglehold of the regime and the military. And the opposition figures who won that 2024 election and who now have this prominent role on the international stage make the existing powers in the country very uncomfortable.

So there’s always going to be this question of whether or not the Venezuelan opposition can coexist with the hard-line elements of the military that remain acting in the country and don’t want any of their interests touched. That was always going to be a conundrum under any circumstance if the current leadership was removed.

So the logic seems to be that in picking someone like Delcy Rodríguez to be the interim figure, that calms the nerves of the key players in the military and the government, the interior minister, the head of the armed forces.

But those guys aren’t naive. Those guys certainly see what course this puts them on — particularly when the administration is now being explicit about the fact that if Rodríguez does anything that the administration doesn’t like, they’ll remove her.

I guess the thinking seems to be that will spook people into maybe agreeing to leave the country. But that has never really been the case.

It’s very, very unclear what the broader calculus is here.

It all reminds me a lot of Iraq. Though I’m not saying that these countries are the same — they do not have the same internal divisions. I’m not saying it will go the same way.

Over the past years, I have read a number of books trying to reconstruct how America ended up in this completely optional, chosen war in Iraq.

One of the things you see when you begin to try to answer the question of why we ended up doing that is that there was no single answer. There were a bunch of factions that each had their own reason for wanting this done, and as an accumulation, it was enough to push the decision-making over the finish line.

The people who hated Saddam Hussein for humanitarian reasons; the people who really did believe in weapons of mass destruction; the people who wanted the oil; the people who wanted to export democracy; the people who wanted to show the world that America was back and you couldn’t mess with us; George W. Bush’s: This guy tried to kill my dad.

Not one of these reasons was good enough, but all of them together created enough pressure that it ended up happening.

This has that strange emergent quality to me. Invading Venezuela for the oil is stupid because we don’t need oil at the moment, and oil prices are low, and we shouldn’t invade countries for oil anyway, and the global energy system is moving over.

In some ways, that’s the scariest prospect here: That it’s the happenstance confluence of individual positions or predispositions of particular people, none of whom, I think it’s fair to say, are people of a high degree of integrity.

We’re talking about someone like Pete Hegseth, whose primary concern, as I understand it in this configuration, is to get on Miller’s good side. So maybe that conditions his acquiescence to Miller’s harder line in a way that a previous secretary of defense would draw a line and say no.

You’ve got Rubio with this age-old ideological obsession that aligns with a jaundiced view that Trump has of the world that harks back to the ’80s — but at the same time also represents a misunderstanding of recent developments.

I asked this question to one former Trump administration official just the other day. This person had been involved in a lot of the decision-making around Venezuela in the first Trump term.

I said: What has changed? Trump initially was reticent to get involved in this direct, overt way. Now, obviously, he’s delighting in it. How do you explain that shift? The only thing I see that has changed is that there was a rationale in the first Trump term that we need to establish democracy or support democracy in the region. Now that’s not even on the table. There isn’t even a gesture made in that direction.

The person went on to enumerate the fact that some recent developments that all occurred during the Biden years and that were obsessions for Trump, in a certain sense, can seem to be aligned with the Venezuela issue.

The rise in overdose deaths — to your point, that’s fentanyl, that is not cocaine. But it doesn’t matter in the rough logic of the current administration.

There’s the idea of the immigration problem. Sure, there are a large number of Venezuelans who have arrived in the United States in recent years. But an intervention like this does not curb the immigration issue at all. In fact, if anything, it unleashes another dimension of it.

There are all these very notional ideas that Trump has latched on to, and they reflect a warped vision of what’s happening in the region.

There’s also supposed to be an idea pushing in the other direction. We keep talking about Trump and what Trump wants, but something that Trump said in his often contradictory but nevertheless repetitive way was that he doesn’t want more wars, he doesn’t want more foreign entanglements.

He ran in 2016 as an opponent of the Iraq war. We can argue about whether or not he actually was when that was happening, but he certainly ran as a critic of it in 2016.

One thing we were endlessly told by MAGA-line figures in this period was that the good thing about Donald Trump is that if he’s in office, he’s not going to waste American blood or treasure going off on adventures in other countries where we don’t know how they’ll end up.

The bulwark on this was supposed to be a MAGA isolationism. What happened to that?

I don’t know that this is a meaningful response, per se, but there is a kind of hermetic logic to the MAGA view of things and to Trump’s view of things in particular. It’s a little bit the idea that action has to be taken to continue to prop up some of the lies and some of the talking points that have come to define Trump’s most visible public positions.

So if you’re always talking about the fact that immigrants are criminals and that specifically Venezuelan immigrants are members of a violent gang, and that violent gang is invading the country, and it’s invading the country at the hands of a foreign dictator who’s trying to sow discord and instability through immigration — if you follow that through to its logical conclusion — if we put the word “logical” in scare quotes — you have something like this direct confrontation with Maduro and, eventually, his ouster.

The fact that there were no lives lost among American soldiers in this operation, I think, contributes to the sense inside the administration that this was a resounding success.

Because we know these things are judged the moment you capture the sovereign of the country. [Laughs.]

It’s truly mind-bending. There’s no way around it. But his whole political brand seems to be built on the idea of his strength and that we’re returning to an era of the Monroe Doctrine.

Can you say quickly what the Monroe Doctrine is?

The Monroe Doctrine, from the 1800s, is the idea that any foreign involvement in the Western Hemisphere will prompt American reprisals or action, that the United States is in charge of the Western Hemisphere, and it will act accordingly. And that gave rise to a series of American interventions in the region and this view that the U.S. is the police force for the Western Hemisphere.

To your question, this seems to fly in the face of the MAGA idea of the importance of isolationism and avoidance of international conflicts, etc. But I think so much of it also speaks to this issue of presidential power and this idea of unapologetic muscle flexing and so on.

Again, I’m casting about for explanations for a series of actions that I don’t think have a logical or substantive explanation. But I’m trying to imagine what the thinking is in the White House where they’re embarking on a project that is extraordinarily complicated and there have been a number of offramps.

I expected the boat bombings and the intercepting of oil ships to continue for several months more before there was direct military action on the ground in Venezuela. I was surprised by the suddenness of this — not necessarily by the outcome, because the administration has been explicit about always wanting to do this sort of thing. But I sort of half-expected all along that there would be some way of drawing down this conflict and declaring victory and moving on to the next thing.

But that’s clearly not how these guys think.

How much do you buy there being a “Wag the Dog” dimension to this?

Trump is down in the polls. The 2025 elections were, across the board, horrendous for Republicans. Anybody reading punditry over the new year was reading piece after piece about the weakening, the shrinking, of Donald Trump: The Trump era is already beginning to end. You’re already seeing the fractures in MAGA.

There has been an overwhelming narrative that Trump is a lame duck of some sort, and that he has lost control of the agenda. There’s an affordability crisis, and he doesn’t have an affordability plan.

Given that this is something they have actually signaled they wanted to do, to what degree do you buy the argument that this is simply Trump attempting to reassert control as the forceful actor of history?

This is his affordability agenda. Because, in theory, one day oil will be cheaper.

He’s now talking about Greenland again. Maybe you can’t pass much in Congress, but maybe you can take territory and show that the world is under your thumb.

Do you buy that?

I don’t quite know, frankly.

I keep going back to the idea of “propaganda through force,” which is the phrase of a former Trump administration official who put this in a political context that I thought was helpful. Which is that there always has to be some ongoing conflict where the president gets to demonstrate his power, his sense of control, his authority.

In that sense, I do think this is kind of tailor made for him in this moment. It’s an issue that he gets to bang the drum on. He gets to say that the Venezuelan government is now taking orders from us. He gets to say that this guy, Maduro, whom he’s talked about ad nauseam for being a horrible person, is finally out.

My understanding of what the administration has done in Venezuela is that it was not an idle outgrowth of this sense of: We need to do something to revive our brand. I think this is something that has been brewing for a while. To your earlier point, I think it was a bunch of different things that finally aligned at the right moment that allowed for this situation to escalate as quickly as it did.

So I do think that this was already set in motion, but I think it’s a very useful political prop for the president.

Of course, I hear myself saying this, and I’m aghast at the idea that this kind of intervention is a “prop,” but I do think that for the administration it is useful in that sense. I certainly think they view it that way.

Always our final question: What are three books you’d recommend to the audience?

My first would be a novel called “The Known World” by Edward P. Jones, about antebellum Virginia. It’s one of the most astonishing novels I’ve ever read, one of my favorite American novels. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

My second recommendation is a memoir by Carolyn Forché called “What You Have Heard Is True.” When she was 27, she was living in El Salvador at the start of what became the Salvadoran civil war, and it’s a reflection on what that period was like for her. It’s incredibly haunting and beautiful — and very much relevant to the current conversation.

My last recommendation would be “The Spy and the Traitor” by Ben Macintyre, from several years back, about a Soviet double agent who was working for the K.G.B. but who became a double agent for British intelligence during the Cold War. Absolutely astonishing true story that reads like fiction.

Octave, Kervenson Martial",,,,,https://haitiantimes.com/2026/01/05/carel-pedre-arrest-ice-custody/,"“One thing that’s interesting is that the ICE case will outlive the criminal case.” Who is Carel Pedre?
Pedre’s immigration status is now the main subject of speculation by internet sleuths, legal experts and his media rivals.
Pedre’s immigration case will move forward separately from his criminal matter.
Or, he may move ahead with any adjustment of status application he may have pending, but that has a likelihood of being denied because of the domestic violence case.
“There’s no due process if you’ve got an immigration case, once ICE gets you,” he said.","Overview:

The arrest of Haitian media personality Carel Pedre following a domestic dispute has placed him in ICE custody, illustrating how contact with local law enforcement — regardless of the charge — can quickly trigger detention before a criminal case is resolved.

For two weeks, Haitians around the world have been abuzz after a domestic violence arrest that could have been a standard criminal court matter instead placed one of the diaspora’s most visible media figures into federal immigration detention — awaiting his fate with deportation looming.

Carel Pedre, the host of the popular program Chokarella and backer of numerous digital series, remains in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following his Dec. 21 arrest in Tamarac, Fla., from a domestic dispute that played out in a neighborhood street. How he ended up spending the holidays in ICE custody is a drama-filled saga that illustrates how brushes with the law can quickly upend lives in an era where Trump administration officials say their goal is to conduct deportations at the speed of “Amazon Prime packages, but with humans.”

With Pedre’s influencer status igniting social media, the arrest also opened a door for unsubstantiated allegations against him, ignited debates about domestic violence in the community, analyses of double standards for privileged people, and spurred speculation about Pedre’s marriage and family life. Florida’s Sunshine Laws, which make public records readily accessible, also unearthed other matters, such as two prior cases where Pedre was accused of stalking violence that were reclosed, meaning resolved after being reopened.

“This is a textbook case of so many things — our biases, lack of understanding and lack of education on some things as a community,” said Frandley Julien, an immigration attorney based in Miami who does not represent Pedre. “Even of people who come from Haiti, where they came from a position of privilege, who cannot adapt to American society.”

Pedre has pleaded not guilty to the domestic violence charge. His attorney has not responded to requests for comment, and his family has asked for privacy. Only Chokarella has issued statements, saying updates will be shared when they do not jeopardize the legal proceedings.

However, how Pedre ended up in detention offers an instructive moment for the community. In just two days, a hardworking entrepreneur from humble beginnings in northwest Haiti — an apparently devoted father of two and well-liked colleague — joined the growing ranks of people from all walks of life who enter ICE custody, caught in the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda and a complex legal process with potentially long-lasting consequences.

“It is extremely common to have these types of cases,” Julien said. “One thing that’s interesting is that the ICE case will outlive the criminal case.”

Who is Carel Pedre?

Pedre’s immigration status is now the main subject of speculation by internet sleuths, legal experts and his media rivals. People have weighed in about the validity of his marriage, why he was living with a girlfriend, reasons Haitians date non-Haitians, and – most vehemently – women making a choice to protect themselves or their significant other when they feel threatened.

Two camps emerged: a #freecarel camp, which insists the argument just got out of control, and a #carelpedre side, which has posted unsavory allegations against Pedre, sometimes reeking with homophobic slurs, and resurfaced past video clips meant to show an elitist attitude.

Coupled with the domestic violence allegations, an emerging portrait of Pedre suggests two contrasting sides. One is the affable, prolific, and visionary entrepreneur the public knows. The other is an opportunistic, entitled figure who has made disparaging remarks about women, poor people, and certain artists.

Either way, Pedre’s emergence as a polarizing figure is a far cry from what the public expected when his star began to rise after the 2010 earthquake that brought him to prominence.

Pedre’s site, carelpedre.com, details his work as a radio and TV personality and philanthropist, who spends much of his time with Haitian celebrities around the world. While documenting the artists’ journeys in the arts, music and entertainment worlds on his many shows, he also works as a brand ambassador for numerous entities and supports several charities.

From Port-de-Paix to Port-au-Prince, a new voice rises

His own journey began in Port-de-Paix, the northwestern Haiti town where he was born to Fritz Pèdre, a technician with the public company Électricité d’Haïti (EDH), and Michelle Pèdre, who worked at the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI).

Locals interviewed by The Haitian Times recall that Pedre attended the National School of the Brothers of Christian Instruction for primary school, then Notre-Dame de Lourdes College (CNDL) for secondary studies. Even as a teenager, he distinguished himself for his intelligence at the local radio station Mélodie FM. He stood out as a promising communicator, a youngster with linguistic talent and remarkable access in the community. He also had a strong interest in information technology.

Pedre once described his attraction to broadcasting in emotional terms.

“Every time I am faced with the need to talk about my beginnings in radio, two feelings come over me: the desire to do better, to go further, and the urge to shed tears,” he reportedly said in a post attributed to him on Africultures.com.

“It was common for me to participate in class debates, whether I was on committees or leading rallies, in reality, I was drawn to microphones.”

At age 20, Pedre went to pursue higher education in Port-au-Prince, beginning his university studies at the Higher School of Infotronics of Haiti (ESIH). People who knew them tell The Haitian Times that Pedre and his two brothers, Steve and Valéry, lived in Tabarre for some time.

During this period, Pedre joined Radio Planèt Kreyòl, then Radio ONE in the capital. In 2007, Pedre began hosting Digicel Stars, Haiti’s top TV show and talent competition, then “Ayiti Deploge,” Digicel’s “Kiyes Ki Toro” – a Shark Tank like competition.

Fashion designer Phelicia Dell met Pedre around that time, first as an invitee to “Ayiti Deploge, then frequent collaborator on events. The VèVè Collections owner says she knows him as a “cool, professional, always there to help.”

“He cares about the image of Haiti, as he always shows through his work. Whatever you’re doing that’s positive, he’ll be there,” Dell recalls. “As an artist, he has a lot of respect for art, for people working hard to change the narrative about Haiti.”

Pedre is also a perfectionist, she said, of his work ethic. His critiques of some performers whom he believed needed to refine their work offended some at times, leading to riffs online.

“For Carel to tell you you’re good, you’re good. He doesn’t really flatter people,” Dell said. “He’s been pushing [backing] people for a long time.”

Out of disaster, new platforms arise

When the 2010 earthquake struck, Pedre was among the first and most consistent in updating people about developments through social media. Afterward, Pedre expanded from radio into digital video and online platforms. His program Chokarella, launched in 2010, built a massive audience in Haiti and the Diaspora, combining news, commentary and cultural coverage.

As technology advanced, so did his web-based content, reaching tens of thousands of people with his morning show alone and making Pedre a giant in Haitian media and entertainment. His Chokarella YouTube channel alone boasts 275,000 subscribers and 38 million views off nearly 2,600 videos posted since 2012. Of the visual podcasts he recently launched with Giuliano “DJ K9” Puzo, the gabfest-style “De Tout et De Rien” — French for “about everything and nothing” — is a crowd favorite. During these moments of camaraderie and online postings, many addressed Pedre as “Ono,” a casual mark of respect short for “your honor.”

In the U.S., he became a familiar face at high-profile events, such as Haitians at Harvard in Boston, hosted panels featuring politicians in Brooklyn, and “vibed” at concerts and shows around Florida.

“Carel did not deserve this,” said Saurel Celestin, a music promoter based in New York who has worked with Pedre. “He has done so much for Haiti, for this community, to see this happen to him is very sad.”

Many credit Pedre for showing a generation of youngsters in Haiti a way to make a living with just their phone and media savvy. He kept Haitians abroad connected to the homeland and each other across borders, with web-based series that profile hitmakers, up-and-comers, people in the periphery and the issues that inspire them.

“As an artist, you haven’t made it until you go on Chokarella or Plezi Mizik,” Celestin said. “A lot of people criticized him for being arrogant. But to me, those are other Haitian media figures who wanted to take his place, and he didn’t take crap from them.”

Landing in Florida amid crisis

In the face of escalating insecurity in Haiti, Pedre relocated to Florida about two years ago — a move that aligned with a broader wave of displacement from the Port-au-Prince area, where 1.4 million people were uprooted in 2024. Unverified reports claim that Pedre allegedly faced threats from gangs and accused him of being too close to certain prominent figures, but neither rumor could be independently verified as of this writing.

In January 2024, according to public records, he and Tanya Marie Lemaire married in Broward County. The mother of two, based in Sunrise, a town adjacent to Tamarac, operates Piece of Cake and Events by Tanya Lemaire — continuing a family baking tradition that originated in Port-au-Prince.

The pair have known each other since at least 2010, according to online archives showing them collaborating on a post-earthquake project. They share a daughter, now 16. Pedre also has a younger daughter.

Adjusting to life out of Florida appears to have come with some friction.

In March 2024, Pedre was accused of “stalking violence after service” by two people, Erwin Papillon and Soraha Papillon. The type of charge is levied when “a person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows, harasses, or cyberstalks another person” continues that behavior after they are served a formal notice, or protective injunction, to stop. Both cases are noted as being reclosed, which occurs when the case stops and resumes without a formal outcome. Details about them are sealed from the public.

Pedre’s relationship with his girlfriend, Richelle Robinson, appeared to have some tension. Few details are publicly available about their connection, but social media posts show she is of Jamaican descent, works in real estate, and frequently shared product reviews. Other posts depict her and Pedre together in various settings — including a barbershop where she’s cutting his hair and cultural events where she wears the Haitian flag.

Now, with Pedre in ICE custody, Robinson has remained mostly silent. Still, she continues to share videos from happier times, showing moments she and Pedre spent together.

Domestic dispute erupts over social media video

A social media post, incidentally, is why the pair argued in their apartment in Tamarac around midnight that Sunday morning of Dec. 21. According to the Broward Sheriff’s Office arrest report, the quarrel occurred after Robinson posted an image on social media that showed Pedre’s “butt crack” that he wanted removed. Pedre took Robinson’s phone and left the apartment, and locked her out of the home from his phone.

A nude Robinson followed Pedre to return her phone, officers reported. She either “did a flip” and fell, as Pedre told deputies, or Pedre pushed her to the ground, as Robinson claims. A neighbor said she allegedly saw Pedre choking Robinson, a claim she denies.

Deputies arrested Pedre and drove him to jail.

To some South Florida residents, being in Tamarac doomed Pedre from the start. The suburb, about 15 miles west of Fort Lauderdale, is a quiet area of planned developments, manicured golf courses, and tall shrubbery that creates a sense of seclusion. It is also the site of a triple murder, where an estranged husband, a known domestic abuser, killed his wife, her father and a neighbor — leading to nearly 20 people at the local station being fired in September. Therefore, many residents say, officers there “are not taking any chances” not making domestic arrests.

Pedre, once led away early Sunday, was booked into the Broward County Main Jail in downtown Fort Lauderdale on a domestic battery charge. Authorities also placed Pedre on an immigration hold. Such detainers are a routine part of law enforcement in many Florida jurisdictions that allow ICE to pick up any immigrant arrested to meet mass deportation goals.

The following day, Monday, a judge reviewing the preliminary charge set bond for release at $1,000, which Pedre posted that day. Broward court documents list Vanessa Joseph as his bond depositor, meaning the person providing the funds or collateral.

That Tuesday, Pedre formally entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a trial by jury, according to the court files.

The video that caused the initial brouhaha was also removed from Robinson’s Instagram account, coinciding with her follower count ballooning.

48 hours for ICE, a lifetime of consequences to process

What happens here — some attorneys and legal observers say — is critical for the next set of events. While domestic violence allegations fall under purview of the criminal courts, arrests also trigger the immigration system, which often moves much more quickly.

With the arrival of ICE looming because of the detainer, Pedre’s lawyer Jeremy McLymont filed a motion for the judge to revoke the bond so Pedre could wait in the Fort Lauderdale jail while the domestic case is resolved. Unfortunately for Pedre, that was too late to stop ICE.

On Wednesday, Christmas Eve morning, the criminal judge called Pedre’s name to go over the bond revocation motion during a virtual hearing. Silence answered.

As it turns out, ICE had picked up Pedre before the 10 a.m. hearing. Later that day, Pedre appeared in a detainee search as being at the Krome Detention Center in Miami. After one night, they transferred him to Florida Soft South Side, better known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” where the influencer spent Christmas. He has since been returned to Krome in Miami.

Lawyers, legal experts and immigrant advocates say Pedre’s transfer into immigration custody reflects a broader reality for immigrants in the United States: Any arrest — from low-level traffic offenses to serious allegations such as domestic violence — can quickly place a noncitizen into deportation proceedings, often before a judge hears the underlying case.

“We have seen a spike during the last four, five months,” Julien says, about ICE custodial arrests triggered by 287(g) agreements. “It’s being applied systematically.

Florida, in particular, leads the nation in the most arrests and detainer requests in the Haitian community. Long a proponent of strict immigration, Florida’s $39 million in ICE contracts puts it atop the 40 states with whom ICE has 1,275 agreements as of Dec. 31 to help identify and detain immigrants.

Deportations at ‘Amazon Prime’ speed goal of new system

Why ICE issued the detainer in the first place is still unknown, though speculation about the type of visa that allowed him into the U.S. and his residency status is rampant online. Such uncertainty mirrors the path of many immigrants who have been arrested for a wide range of alleged offenses and subsequently transferred to ICE custody. Charges may vary in severity and their status may or may not be clear, but the mechanism is often the same: an arrest creates a pathway into immigration detention, even when criminal cases are unresolved or later dismissed.

Federal immigration authorities have spoken openly about these actions. At an Arizona conference earlier this year, they discussed funneling people through the deportation process as quickly as possible, saying they were aiming for “[Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”

With Trump’s mass deportation executive order aimed at bypassing standard proceedings — where someone had to be convicted and sentenced before deporting them — immigration enforcement no longer depends on the severity of a charge or the outcome of a criminal case. As a result, immigrants can be detained before they can bond out or the evidence is evaluated.

Julien says he has had to defend Haitians arrested for an array of suspected offenses that end up facing immigration charges too. Among them was a mother who was spanking her daughter, a cultural holdover in many Haitian households, and a husband whose wife called the police over a trivial matter. Even though the husband is a permanent resident, he still had an immigration hold placed when arrested.

“Domestic violence is pervasive in the Haitian community, unfortunately,” Julien said, adding that most of his cases are of men abusing women. “We have too much of it.

“But some people take it too far,” he said. “They don’t have control over their impulses.”

Case reveals rifts in community perspectives

As Pedre’s family navigates the judicial and immigration systems, Haitians have been divided in their reactions to the domestic dispute and response to Pedre’s arrest as a celebrity.

Velina E. Charlier, a well-known manbo, said in a Facebook comment that she hoped the experience would be a new opportunity for Pedre to shed light on immigrants in detention.

“The same way you did during Jan. 12, telling us what you were living, I’m counting on you to keep your voice, to talk about the many immigrants from different nations in ICE prisons. The road is hard, but I know you’ll have the strength to get across it.”

On the opposing side are people like Patricia Latour, a former collaborator of Pedre’s. She suggested in a post on Dec. 26 that the focus should be on victims of domestic violence, not Pedre, for his celebrity status. Another social media user said the case would give air to the alleged wrongdoing Pedre may have engaged in. Neither offered definitive proof of any ill behaviors, but the suggestions alone have fueled discussions about stopping people with privilege in Haiti from getting away with harmful acts.

Back in Port-de-Paix, residents seemed indifferent to Pedre’s predicament.

Some people said they still feel slighted by him after he declined to participate in the town’s carnival festivities in 2021.

“He has never engaged in any local activity,” said Pierla Julien, 27. “He’s no longer proud to be from the Northwest. It’s time we give him that same energy.

From a general standpoint, she added, “Violence against women must stop and be punished with the utmost severity. Carel must face justice — no one is above the law.”

A childhood acquaintance of Pedre’s, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution, said Pedre is facing an indefensible position.

“It’s hard for me to stand with Carel, even though we grew up in the same neighborhood,” the friend said. “I can’t support him when he’s done wrong,” said the friend.

Steve Pedre, one of his brothers, wrote on a Facebook post with the #FreeCarel hashtag that support had outnumbered disparaging posts about the influencer.

“From where he is now, he’s getting the messages,” the brother said. “He’ll be back stronger and better.”

Dell, the fashion designer, said she feels sorry that Pedre and his family are going through this experience. From her interactions with him, Dell said she is certain Pedre will do the right thing, whatever that may be, when he is able.

“I’m just waiting for him to say exactly what happened,” she said. “If he did anything wrong, I know he’s the type that would apologize to the woman, to the community, if he really did something wrong. He has a very strong character.”

Saturday, a change.org petition began circulating, asking ICE and Trump to release Pedre that has since received 12,000 signatures. In the petition, the authors said: “We understand that immigration laws are complex and must be upheld; however, detaining individuals like Carel, who are contributing members of their communities, only serves to fortify unjust prejudices and hinder social progress.”

Others writing in social media said such appeals are misplaced and reek of preferential treatment for Pedre because he is prominent, especially considering that some 520,000 Haitian TPS holders are subject to deportation, and no such petition has emerged for them.

Pedre’s immigration case will move forward separately from his criminal matter. Depending on his immigration status, he may request voluntary departure, Julien, the attorney, said. Or, he may move ahead with any adjustment of status application he may have pending, but that has a likelihood of being denied because of the domestic violence case.

As both cases play out, one this is crystal clear for Haitian families in the U.S. The South Florida attorney speaking anonymously said in a place like Miami, where many parents arrived without papers and stayed to build lives while immigration approved their cases, they would’ve all been deported under this administration.

“There’s no due process if you’ve got an immigration case, once ICE gets you,” he said.

In the near term, two cap-free categories often act as substitutes for roles that would otherwise have defaulted to H-1B: O-1 and L-1.
O-1 Visa for Business, STEM, and Creative Roles The O-1 is a temporary work visa for individuals who have reached the top tier of their field.
L-1 Visa for Executives, Managers, and Specialists The L-1 enables an intracompany transfer from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. entity and is also not capped.
Essential eligibility requires one continuous year of qualifying employment abroad within the last three years, a qualifying corporate relationship, and a bona fide U.S. role that matches the classification.","Employers are facing the prospect of a $100,000 payment for H-1B petitions, and while efforts to halt the fee through litigation are underway, prospects are uncertain at best. This prospective fee has forced many employers to rethink headcount plans, quarterly budgets, campus recruiting timelines, vendor statement(s) of work, , and October onboarding targets. Per guidance shared by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in October, the $100,000 payment generally applies to new H-1B petitions filed for beneficiaries outside the United States, and it generally does not apply to petitions seeking an amendment, change of status, or extension of stay for individuals already in the U.S. in valid status.

Furthermore, whether litigation from government bodies or legal organizations delay or cancel the payment, hiring decisions are happening now, and projects cannot wait for policy to settle. That’s why I’ve been talking with candidates and employers about how to maintain momentum by evaluating cap-independent options that fit the actual work to be done. Cap-exempt H-1B positions at universities and nonprofit research institutions still exist in specific circumstances, but they won’t meet most private-sector needs. In the near term, two cap-free categories often act as substitutes for roles that would otherwise have defaulted to H-1B: O-1 and L-1.

O-1 Visa for Business, STEM, and Creative Roles

The O-1 is a temporary work visa for individuals who have reached the top tier of their field. It covers science, education, business, the arts, and athletics, and it is not subject to the H-1B cap. To qualify, you show either a major, internationally recognized award or a consistent pattern of evidence such as original contributions of major significance, influential publications or patents, invited judging of others’ work, press recognition, selective memberships, high compensation relative to peers, or critical roles at distinguished organizations. You do not need all of these; the key is demonstrating sustained acclaim and impact that independent sources can corroborate.

For candidates in tech and business, the evidence often looks like widely adopted product launches, performance or security gains tied to your work, leadership in standards bodies, or peer-reviewed citations. For creatives, it may be juried awards, festival selections, gallery representation, or wide-reaching media coverage. An O-1 can be filed by a single employer or by a U.S. agent for multi-client work if engagements are cohesive and within the same field. Initial approval is up to three years, with extensions in one-year increments tied to continuing work. While O-1 is not the classic “dual-intent” category, many candidates pair it with future permanent residence planning once the U.S. role and timing are clear. This approach is permissible under 8 CFR 214.2(o), which clarifies that an O‑1 applicant may concurrently have a pending or approved immigrant petition without jeopardizing their nonimmigrant status. If your track record shows supported, independently recognized impact, O-1 can be not just an alternative to H-1B, but a better substantive fit.

L-1 Visa for Executives, Managers, and Specialists

The L-1 enables an intracompany transfer from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. entity and is also not capped. L-1A is for executives and managers and L-1B is for professionals with specialized knowledge of your company’s products, processes, or systems. Essential eligibility requires one continuous year of qualifying employment abroad within the last three years, a qualifying corporate relationship, and a bona fide U.S. role that matches the classification. L-1A status can total up to seven years (in increments), while L-1B up to five years. Spouses (L-2) are employment-authorized incident to status, which can be a practical advantage for families.

For L-1A, the focus is on executive or managerial authority—directing people and budgets, setting policy, and exercising encompassing decision-making latitude. For L-1B, the emphasis is on proprietary, advanced knowledge that is central to delivering a specific U.S. project or product. If you’re launching or expanding a U.S. office, a “new office” L-1 is possible with credible premises, capital, and early hiring milestones. A further benefit: L-1A managers may align with the EB-1C green card category without labor certification. If you already work for a multinational company and your U.S. assignment depends on leadership or specialized know-how, L-1 can be the most direct way to get on the ground.

Strategy, Sequencing, and Staying Practical

Whether an O-1 or L-1 would work for you depends on your facts. If your influence is recognized across your field and can be shown through independent evidence, O-1 keeps you out of the cap and accommodates both single-employer and agent-based engagements. And if your company has a qualifying affiliate abroad and your U.S. role builds on that global structure, L-1 provides a direct bridge with clear maximum-stay rules and, for managers, a streamlined green card track. Some candidates pursue both—timing an L-1 transfer for near-term project needs while developing an O-1 profile for longer-term flexibility, or vice versa.

Whichever route you consider, align the visa with the work you will actually do in the U.S., make sure the U.S. role matches the category’s requirements, and plan your next step early so extensions and permanent residence do not become fire drills. For candidates already in the United States, H-1B change of status remains financially and procedurally viable under the standard fee schedule; where hiring requires consular processing abroad, the $100,000 payment becomes the key budget variable. In either scenario, O-1 and L-1 remain durable, cap-free tools to keep work on track without the lottery.

Under requirements passed by Congress in 2018, the agency then has 90 days to publish a report on the death.
That document, called a “Detainee Death Report,” provides a brief summary of the person’s medical history and the circumstances that the government says led to their death.
In the Imperial Valley, the missed deadline is raising continued questions about the quality of medical care at the detention center.
“We should be having oversight in the detention center,” she said.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has failed to meet a congressionally-mandated deadline to release more details about the in-custody death of a Chinese immigrant held at an Imperial County detention center in late September.

The deadline, established by Congress in a 2018 spending bill, gives the federal immigration agency 90 days to publish a report about what happened when someone dies while in custody.

Huabing Xie died on Sept. 29, according to ICE. In a press release, the agency said Xie had a seizure while being held at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico and died that afternoon at a nearby hospital.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment last week. The agency previously declined to answer KPBS’ questions, citing an ongoing investigation.

The delay in releasing details about Xie’s death comes as the number of immigrants dying in federal detention continues to grow. In October, NPR reported that 2025 had become the deadliest year in decades for immigrants held by the U.S. government.

Since then, deaths appear to have risen sharply. In December alone, seven people died in ICE custody, according to Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies immigration enforcement.

Immigrants’ rights advocates said the delay is keeping crucial information from reaching the public, local officials and members of Congress who could choose to investigate further.

“It is quite disturbing,” said Jesse Franzblau, a policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “Particularly as they are simultaneously expanding the detention system to far larger than we have ever seen before.”

ICE has to meet certain requirements when someone dies in their custody.

The agency is supposed to immediately report the death to several federal watchdogs and let the public know within 48 hours, according to a February 2025 internal policy memo.

Second, ICE is supposed to investigate how the person died. The agency said online it conducts a series of internal medical reviews and oversight investigations, which are eventually sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Under requirements passed by Congress in 2018, the agency then has 90 days to publish a report on the death. That document, called a “Detainee Death Report,” provides a brief summary of the person’s medical history and the circumstances that the government says led to their death.

Although those reports are often very limited in scope and detail, Franzblau said they are an important first step towards greater transparency.

“The value is to incentivize increased scrutiny,” he said. “For Congress to then use that to push further and to expose the actual facts behind the death in custody.”

The last time ICE released a report was for Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a former-DACA recipient who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County and died just one week before Xie.

In the Imperial Valley, the missed deadline is raising continued questions about the quality of medical care at the detention center.

Weeks after Xie’s death, Management and Training Corporation (MTC) — the private prison company that runs the facility — posted a job online seeking a doctor to provide emergency medical aid and “monitor all potential catastrophic illnesses.”

Marina Arteaga, an organizer with the advocacy group Imperial Liberation Collaborative, said ICE has, since last summer, barred immigrants’ rights advocates from visiting detainees inside the local detention facility.

Arteaga said her organization has been able to communicate with several detainees through family members, but they have not been able to get updates on conditions inside the facility.

After Xie’s death, Arteaga and other local activists asked the Imperial County Public Health Department to use their state-granted powers to inspect the facility. The county still has not agreed to do an inspection, she said.

“We should be having oversight in the detention center,” she said. “We’re talking state-level, federal-level, county-level. And there hasn’t been any.”

Arteaga also emphasized that Xie had no known criminal record and had been released on an order of recognizance after his initial arrest along the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/52d8b07/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3175+0+424/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F15%2Fe32149a345708ffbd39513f0f36d%2F20240213-imperial-county-file-el-centro-evening-2-020.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:57:48.430752

Everpeak Hospitality, the company overseeing the hotel, apologized about the cancellation in a statement and wrote that it had contacted the agents to “ensure they are accommodated.”

“We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,” the company said. “We are committed to welcoming all guests and operating in accordance with brand standards, applicable laws, and our role as a professional hospitality provider.”

Hilton Hotels and Resorts told NOTUS earlier on Monday that it was investigating an independently owned hotel under its brand in Minnesota after DHS posted the now-viral complaint on social media.

The department, which on Sunday launched a 30-day operational surge in Minneapolis, posted screenshots of emails citing immigration operations as the reason for the canceled reservations at a hotel outside the city.

“When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations,” the agency posted.

“We are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property,” one of the screenshots states.

The images block out the senders’ names but include Hilton email addresses, identifying the property in question as a Hampton Inn in Lakeville, Minnesota, just south of Minneapolis.

A Hilton spokesperson told NOTUS that the Minnesota hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions don’t reflect the company’s values.

“This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement. “We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter and are contacting impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated.

Just days after a covert mission to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and strike the capital city, Hegseth announced that Kelly faces retirement grade determination proceedings, a rare administrative action that could see the former astronaut and navy captain demoted in his retired rank. Hegseth accused Kelly of making “seditious statements” that undermined military discipline.

In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers, all military or intelligence veterans, released a 90-second video speaking directly to service members , calling on troops to uphold the constitution and defy what they characterized as illegal commands

“Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth said in a statement posted on X, adding that Kelly “is still accountable to military justice” as a retired officer receiving military pay.

The Pentagon declined to comment further beyond the post on social media.

After learning of the censure, Kelly called Hegseth “the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country’s history” and vowed to “fight this with everything I’ve got”.

“Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn’t like, they will come after them the same way,” Kelly said in a statement. “It’s outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.”

“If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country’s history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn’t get it.

Hegseth’s statement claims Kelly’s conduct between June and December 2025 violated articles 133 and 134 of the uniform code of military justice, which the senator remains subject to as a retired officer drawing pension payments. The defense secretary argues Kelly “characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders”.

But the accusation on its face has been contested for months. Military law already requires that troops refuse unlawful orders, which is what Kelly and other members of Congress were echoing. And federal judges have ruled Donald Trump’s military deployments in Los Angeles and other cities violated the Posse Comitatus Act, suggesting the orders Kelly warned about may have actually been illegal.

In the video lawmakers released in November by Kelly and his colleagues – senator Elissa Slotkin and representatives Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan, Slotkin acknowledged that military personnel were “under enormous stress and pressure right now” under the Trump administration’s policies.

Days after the video’s release, Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post.

Kelly has 30 days to respond to the censure, which will be placed in his permanent military personnel file. The Pentagon chief has directed the navy secretary to complete the rank review within 45 days.

The move marks an extraordinary step by the defense department against a sitting US senator and threatened that more action could be coming.

“Captain Kelly’s status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action,” Hegseth wrote.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8fbf2ef78591ddc4d897501fccc144a69b844b/418_0_4164_3333/master/4164.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7443c6a91970ec748e57211779b0f680",N,,2026-01-06 04:58:23.188581

The Trump administration captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday.

The operation followed months of airstrikes on suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea from Venezuela and a Trump administration pressure campaign to oust Maduro.

Administration officials say Maduro’s capture was a law enforcement action that merely used military resources and therefore did not require congressional approval, referencing a drug trafficking indictment issued by the Department of Justice in March.

U.S. Rep. Sean Casten, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s western and southwestern suburbs, said Monday that some Democrats were briefed before the new year on U.S. strikes on boats but not on any operation to capture Maduro.

“They (administration officials) made it very clear that this was purely to attack boats in international waters — they did not make any mention of actually invading a sovereign nation, much less kidnapping the president and his wife,” Casten said.

The 1980 Intelligence Oversight Act requires the president to brief the “Gang of Eight” — party leaders from both chambers and the top Democrats and Republicans on the intelligence committees — in advance of “any significant anticipated intelligence activity.” Those lawmakers were instead briefed Monday afternoon, though some Republicans were briefed earlier, Casten said.

“We were told that the White House had reached out to some degree to a few Republicans in advance,” Casten said. “The Constitution doesn’t say that you only give your party notification, it says you give Congress notification. So Congress is still very much in the dark on this operation.”

In response to the operation, a group of senators led by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., are pushing a war powers resolution that would bar further military action in Venezuela without congressional approval.

U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side and south suburbs, said he was concerned about the precedent the attack on Venezuela could set.

“If this is the world of might is right, then that means the larger army of the Russians can go take Ukraine and take land,” Jackson said. “That means Saddam Hussein had the right to go into Iraq and Kuwait and say that was his 19th province. That means China can go into Taiwan. That means the United States can claim the land of the Venezuelan people and say it’s our oil.”

Trump said Saturday that American oil companies would soon enter Venezuela, which holds about a fifth of the world’s oil reserves. He also cited Cuba and Colombia as Western Hemisphere nations that could soon face U.S. military action.

Jackson said sustained U.S. military intervention in Latin America would be an improper use of federal funds.

“Who’s going to pay for this? This is an appropriation that they skirted around. This thing easily cost $1-2 billion,” Jackson said. “He’s going to start this precedent and threaten the government of Cuba, the government of Colombia.”

At an emergency UN Security Council meeting Monday morning, representatives of Russia and China condemned the U.S. attack as a violation of international law and national sovereignty. Casten levied the same criticism.

“It is true that Maduro was indicted in U.S. courts,” Casten said. “That does not give any law enforcement agency the jurisdiction to go into another country. International law is pretty clear. You either need to go to the UN Security Council and get approval. The alternative is if you have an imminent military threat to your country, none of those conditions were present.”

Still, some Republicans say they're concerned about President Trump's comments saying he wants to effectively run Venezuela for the time being.

And some Democrats have made sharp calls for more oversight following the operation.

""I have no love lost for Maduro. Good riddance to him, may he be brought to justice. But the way the president has gone about this has been very chaotic,"" said Rep. Madeleine Dean, (D-PA). ""The administration does not have its story straight. As planned as this was, as much as the military planned for weeks, as [Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine] talked about, and exquisitely brought this about, but they didn't come to Congress.""

Democrats, led by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, are expected to take a vote at some point this week on limiting war powers for the Trump administration and curtail their ability to conduct a certain military operations without congressional authorization in Venezuela.

It seems unlikely that the vote will succeed. Many Republicans in Congress have made clear that they stand behind the Trump administration and their decision to apparently unilaterally going to Venezuela and extract Maduro.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also demanded that members of his party take a strong stance against Trump's illegal Venezuela attack.","President Donald Trump's invasion of Venezuela is generating fresh calls for his impeachment and removal from office.

Shortly after the US military bombed the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and abducted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, many experts on international law argued that the president's actions were completely illegal.

In an interview with the New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner, Yale Law School professor Oona Hathaway said that she didn't believe there ""is a legal basis for what we’re seeing in Venezuela,"" while adding that the arguments the Trump administration will likely make simply ""don't hold water.""

For instance, Hathaway noted that while the United Nations charter allows nations to use military force in self-defense against military aggression, the administration's claims that attacking Maduro was a defensive measure intended to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the US was completely outside the scope of traditional self-defense.

""If drug trafficking is a reasonable justification, then a whole range of possible arguments can be made that basically mean that self-defense is no longer a real exception,"" she argued. ""It’s the new rule. Why couldn’t you make the same argument about communicable diseases? There’s bird flu coming from a country, and therefore we have a legal justification for the use of military force. Once we start going down that road, the idea that there’s any limit evaporates.""

Hathaway also said that Trump's militaristic ambitions seem to have grown throughout his second term, and she warned they could lead to a long and bloody US military occupation of Venezuela.

""In his press conference, Trump said that the United States would 'run the country,'"" she said. ""And he made it clear that he was not 'afraid' to put boots on the ground—for years, if necessary... it’s nothing like anything Trump has done before today. His previous illegal uses of force were all over shortly after they began. The scale of the operation that will be required is massive, and it means putting US soldiers at long-term risk.""

Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith wrote a lengthy analysis after the attack on Venezuela and also concluded that it violated the UN charter. What's more, Goldsmith argued that Trump's state plan to seize Venezuela's oil would likely run afoul of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which limits actions that occupying powers can take on the countries they are overseeing.

""There are a lot of international law rules and restrictions that purport to govern what the United States can do as an occupying power,"" he explained. ""I don’t have space here to review them, but suffice it to say that these rules will touch on President Trump’s stated aim of 'tak[ing] back the oil' and 'get[ting] reimbursed.' We will see if the administration takes these rules seriously.""

Many Trump critics also argued that, legality aside, toppling a foreign head of state and vowing to seize their nation's natural resources was morally wrong and deserving of impeachment.

""This is the behavior of a mob boss—but with nuclear weapons and the world's strongest military,"" argued Zeteo editor-in-chief Medhi Hassan. ""None of this is legal. Trump should be impeached by Congress and indicted at The Hague.""

Leah Greenberg, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible, denounced Trump's attack on Venezuela as ""wildly illegal, immoral, and irresponsible,"" and urged the US Congress to exercise its powers to stop the president from further escalation.

""The power to declare war belongs to Congress and the American people,"" Greenberg said. ""Trump has once again taken power that's not his. He is attempting to drag the country into war by decree, all while treating the presidency like a throne. Congress must act immediately to stop these illegal strikes and hold the Trump regime accountable. No Kings, No War.""

Cavan Kharrazian, senior policy adviser for Demand Progress, demanded congressional action to ""stop this reckless, unconstitutional act of war.""

""We have seen what happens when the White House invents a pretext to launch a regime change war with an oil-rich nation: disaster and suffering for innocent civilians, our troops and their families, all while costing the American taxpayer a fortune as well,"" said Kharrazian. ""Congress must do the right thing by voting to stop this obvious catastrophe.""

Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic candidate for US Congress in Illinois, wrote on Bluesky that the time for Democratic politicians to issue mealy-mouthed statements about Trump's actions was over.

""Democrats need to grow a fucking spine,"" she wrote. ""No more strongly worded letters. It’s time to draft articles of impeachment. Impeach. Convict. Remove.""

KELLY: One more question for you, Senator Warner, and it has to do with the overarching goal here.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

What is the role of Congress as this whole Venezuela situation unfolds? Senior members of the Trump administration are on Capitol Hill today to brief lawmakers. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is among those asking questions. He's the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. We have him on the line from Capitol Hill. Senator, Happy New Year. Good to speak with you.

MARK WARNER: Thank you, Mary Louise. Happy New Year to you as well.

KELLY: Chairman of the joint chiefs, the attorney general, the CIA director, defense secretary all briefing Congress today. What do you want to know?

WARNER: Well, first of all, I do want to acknowledge that getting Maduro out of the government of Venezuela - he was a bad guy, and candidly, we should have worked more strongly with the Venezuelan people when they voted overwhelmingly against him in 2024. But that still begs the question of what next? You know, the president says we're going to run Venezuela. For how long? How? If we're going to do it literally with troops on the ground or somehow with simply a fleet threatening offshore? I've got questions about how we got here in terms of the intelligence community's role. I want to get clarification on that. I, of course, won't be able to share that, but I want to get that information.

And then, you know, we have heard this theory before that we're going to come into a country, i.e., Iraq, and they're going to pay for - the Iraqi oil will pay for the whole occupation. And it appears that the president's making the same claim about Venezuelan oil. How is that going to take place? I mean, the Venezuelan oil fields that used to produce 4 million barrels a day, they're now down to 1 million. Everything I've read has said that it would take two to three years to get those back operational back to previous levels. Are we there for that long a time?

KELLY: So you have questions about the budget and who's going to pay for this? Go on.

WARNER: The budget on this. And finally, just, you know, on a broader basis, you know, the enormous precedent this sets if, suddenly, we can go in and snatch a leader if they have violated our law. What would then stop Putin using that same theory of the case to take out Zelenskyy from Kyiv, or what would stop President Xi from taking Taiwan since Chinese law has said that Taiwan is simply a breakaway province?

KELLY: I mean, you're raising a very big-picture question about the global order shifting as we speak. What's the answer to that question? If the U.S. claims the Western Hemisphere, why wouldn't Russia be free to do the same in Europe?

WARNER: That's why I'm going to ask the question. If you follow the logic, there would not be any preclusion. And let's - I think, you know, for the last 70-plus years - basically, since the 60s - I think America - it didn't matter whether it was a Democratic or Republican administration - has tried to build a new kind of arrangement with Central America and South America where we looked at those countries as partners. I've always been interested - I was an exchange student in Argentina. I'm fascinated with the region. I think we've treated them, frankly, badly, year in and year out. Benign neglect. But the notion that we're kind of reintroducing a colonial/imperial sphere of influence towards everything in the Western Hemisphere, that seems to go against everything over the last 70 years in terms of American foreign policy.

KELLY: I want to ask about the lack of congressional authorization for this Venezuela attack. Now, Secretary of State Rubio maintains this was not, in fact, an attack. This was a law enforcement operation, and therefore no congressional authorization was needed. Do you buy that?

WARNER: No, I don't. You know, I worked well with Secretary Rubio. We were good partners when he was on the Intel Committee. And he did - let me be clear - he did try to reach me after the strike had started. We didn't connect, but he did try to reach me. But the idea that somehow this was a law enforcement action, it doesn't pass the smell test. We had a whole fleet off the coast of Venezuela. When you send in the Delta Force, our top military operatives, into a nation-state to extract their leader, that is not a law enforcement action. And I don't know how we can credibly make that case.

KELLY: And when President Trump is threatening that there will be additional action if Venezuela doesn't cooperate going forward, you would argue congressional authorization will be needed for that?

WARNER: I would say, of course, there needs to be. And Senator Kaine will have a war powers resolution on Venezuela up this...

KELLY: This is your colleague, Senator Tim Kaine.

WARNER: Yes.

KELLY: Yep.

WARNER: I will vote for that. I'm sure most of the - all of the Democrats will vote for it. And the question I have, you know, in terms of congressional oversight, it only works if it's truly bipartisan. And I had so many of my Republican colleagues, particularly in the last few weeks after the elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, start to say, well, you know, they maybe willing to speak up more. It'll be very curious to see whether my Republican friends are going to simply continue to write a blank check to this president to take this kind of really significant action without any approval or even prewarning to Congress.

KELLY: Stay with that. Senator Kaine, who you mentioned, has tried to get this war powers resolution passed in past. He's not been able to do so 'cause he doesn't have Republican votes. You would need four. Do you see any sign that your Republican colleagues are likely to line up in blocking the president when they have not done so very often at all in the last year?

WARNER: It is - it's a new year, and hope springs eternal. But if I'm laying a wager, I'm not sure. But it's - the question is, what kind of action is going to finally spur them into activity?

KELLY: One more question for you, Senator Warner, and it has to do with the overarching goal here. We were told - Americans were told - for months that the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela was about drugs, that this was about protecting Americans by fighting drug trafficking. President Trump didn't mention drugs very often in his address from Mar-a-Lago over the weekend. He now seems to be focused on oil. Is it clear to you from your perch in the U.S. Senate what the U.S. endgame is?

WARNER: It is not clear to me. And matter of fact, if you look at the indictment of Maduro, out of the Southern District of New York, it doesn't even mention fentanyl at all, which is, again, the drug that is doing the most damage in our country. I think, unfortunately, this is about oil. I think this was ill-advised. I don't think there was a real plan. I do think our military executed brilliantly, and Maduro off the stage is good. But, you know, if we really want a collaborative relationship with Venezuela - which we had for many, many decades - we also ought to be interested in the welfare of the Venezuelan people. And this does not bode well for us. It doesn't bode well for the Venezuelans. It doesn't bode well for regional stability.

KELLY: Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. Senator, thank you.

WARNER: Thank you.

In its post, the agency appeared to reference the Biblical story of Mary and Joseph being denied “room at the inn” ahead of the birth of Jesus and shared a pair of redacted screenshots regarding the alleged cancellations in Minnesota.

“After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and will be cancelling your upcoming reservation,” reads one of the messages, dated January 2, which features an “@hilton” email address and a reference to the Everpeak Hospitality group.

DHS did not provide evidence to The Independent when asked how it knew agents were victims of a “coordinated campaign.”

""This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values,” Hilton told The Independent in an email statement. “We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies.

Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

President Donald Trump did not exceed his authority when he issued a Sept. 19 proclamation requiring employers to pay an additional $100,000 before new H-1B visas can be processed, a federal district court judge held Dec. 23 in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

President Trump legitimately exercised his broad discretion authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the entry of noncitizens into the U.S., the judge found. Trump found the proclamation was necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B program, which the proclamation asserts is harming American workers and creating a national security threat, he said.

The ruling does not discount the contributions H-1B workers are making to the American economy, the judge stressed. But the parties’ debate over how the proclamation will affect employers and the economy is not within the court’s province to decide, so long as it is within the confines of the law, she said.

Dive Insight:

Following the ruling, the Chamber posted a statement by Executive Vice President and Chief Counsel Daryl Joseffer that said, “The $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive for businesses, especially small- and medium-sized businesses that can least afford it. We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations.”

The Chamber filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 29.

The Chamber, a business federation with approximately 300,000 members, and the Association of American Universities, an organization representing U.S.-based research universities, sued the Trump Administration in October. It was the first of at least three lawsuits by different groups challenging the proclamation, including California v. Noem, filed mid-December by 20 state attorney generals from mainly Democratic states.

The litigation focuses on two issues — that President Trump exceeded his delegated authority, or acted “ultra vires,” under the INA and that DHS and the State Department “arbitrarily” implemented the proclamation without following proper notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The judge ruled against the Chamber and AAU on both claims.

""This is a massive resource allocation,"" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming ""the new Chicago,"" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.
That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities — particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.
The governor and other state leaders have warned that the move, along with a heightened federal law enforcement presence, risks harming legitimate businesses and families who rely on public assistance programs.","The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.

The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, the agency's investigative arm tasked with fighting transnational crimes, the officials said. They requested anonymity to discuss operations that have not been publicly announced.

The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown in the new year, officials said. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud, building on last month's inspection of dozens of sites in the Minneapolis area.

Officials said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen controversial immigration roundups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans, is expected to arrive in Minnesota to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.

The deployment, which began Sunday, represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. The move greatly expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota at a time of heightened political and community tension there.

According to senior law enforcement officials, the surge includes several hundred additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations, as well as hundreds of officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations. Tactical units known as Special Response Teams are also slated to be part of the operation, along with a layered command structure of dozens of high-ranking supervisors.

One former law enforcement official described the scale as extraordinary, noting that the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona. ""This is a massive resource allocation,"" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming ""the new Chicago,"" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.

Multiple officials told CBS News the total federal presence could ultimately become even larger, with as many as 600 HSI agents and up to 1,500 ICE ERO officers rotating through the Minneapolis area over the course of the month-long deployment.

CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Late last year, ICE launched an immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, targeting immigrants who had been issued deportation orders, including those from Somalia. As of Dec. 19, ICE had carried out nearly 700 arrests as part of the operation, according to DHS.

The new surge comes amid intense state and federal scrutiny of Minnesota following years of high-profile fraud cases involving federally funded programs. They have included some of the largest pandemic-era and post-pandemic fraud schemes in the country, like the Feeding Our Future case, which led to dozens of indictments and convictions.

Federal prosecutors have charged more than 90 people in Minnesota-based fraud cases since 2021, with more than 60 convictions so far, according to court records. Investigators have revealed the alleged schemes span multiple federal programs, including nutrition, housing stabilization and child care assistance, with potential losses estimated in the billions of dollars.

In recent weeks, federal activity across the Minneapolis area has increased, with HSI agents canvassing businesses and ICE officers conducting arrests in and around immigrant-populated neighborhoods. That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities — particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.

President Trump has regularly cited Somalia — often in incendiary terms — to justify his mass deportation campaign. Last month, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia ""garbage"" and said they ""contribute nothing.""

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" the president said. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

At the same time, Minnesota officials led by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have pushed back on claims that the state failed to act, pointing to audits, third-party reviews, the appointment of a program-integrity director and the creation of a statewide fraud-prevention council.

But Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection to a third term as criticism has boiled over.

Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that the governor met with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday, as the fellow Democrat considers whether or not to enter the race.

The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen $185 million in federal child care payments to Minnesota, citing ongoing fraud concerns.

Screenshots DHS shared on social media appear to show the hotel operators rejecting the reservations made by enforcement agents at the Hampton Inn in Lakeville, Minnesota – about 25 miles from Minneapolis – because of their affiliation with Immigration Customs and Enforcement. DHS said the agents had booked rooms using official government emails and rates.

“We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property,” a screenshot reads, though email addresses and names were redacted. “If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation.”

“Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property,” the screenshot also reads.

“This is UNACCEPTABLE,” DHS said in its social media post.

The Trump administration says it’s combating suspected fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Democratic-led Minnesota. The Biden administration also investigated fraud there, including theft from Medicaid programs, leading to dozens of arrests and convictions.

Federal prosecutors have charged more than 80 people with being involved in the scheme since 2022, the majority of them U.S. citizens of Somali descent. At least 60 suspects have been convicted.

Minnesota is home to the largest population of people with Somali ancestry, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population is estimated between 60,000 and 80,000 people.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has seized on the scandal, calling out Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who ran against him as the 2024 Democratic vice presidential candidate. The president has also called out the Somali community in the state, at one point calling them ""garbage,"" in comments local officials criticized as racist and un-American.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in late December the administration is exploring the denaturalization of those Somali-Americans in Minnesota responsible for the fraud, a move that would seek to strip U.S. citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.

They also can’t hand over Medicaid data about U.S. citizens or legal immigrants in the 22 plaintiff states, he wrote.
HHS first shared the personal data on millions of Medicaid enrollees in a handful of states in June.
Immigration advocates have said the disclosure of personal data could cause alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children.","NEW YORK (AP) — The nation’s health department starting Monday can resume sharing the personal data of certain Medicaid enrollees with deportation officials, according to a federal judge’s ruling, in a blow to states that had sued the administration over privacy concerns.

But the judge’s decision, issued last Monday, strictly limits the scope of data from the 22 plaintiff states that can be shared — for now only allowing the agency to hand over basic biographical information about immigrants residing in the United States illegally. The states’ lawsuit came after an Associated Press report identified the data sharing policy.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco comes after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it planned to share the data again as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Chhabria in August had initially blocked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from sharing the personal data, which includes home addresses, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. In December, he extended that temporary order.

Then, last week, Chhabria ruled that after the temporary order expires on Jan. 5, HHS can resume sharing “basic biographical, location and contact information” about immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. He wrote in a court filing that this sharing “is clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

While the lawsuit plays out, HHS and CMS aren’t allowed to give detailed, sensitive medical information about enrollees to the Department of Homeland Security or ICE, Chhabria wrote. They also can’t hand over Medicaid data about U.S. citizens or legal immigrants in the 22 plaintiff states, he wrote.

In explaining why he blocked the broader data sharing, Chhabria wrote that the new federal policies “are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be.”

It wasn’t clear Monday whether HHS had resumed sharing data on Medicaid recipients living in the U.S. illegally, and a spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Immigrants illegally living in the U.S., as well as some who are lawfully present, are not allowed to enroll in the Medicaid program that offers nearly free coverage for health services. But federal law requires all states to offer emergency Medicaid, a temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including non-U.S. citizens. Medicaid is a jointly funded program between states and the federal government.

HHS first shared the personal data on millions of Medicaid enrollees in a handful of states in June.

In July, CMS entered into a new agreement that gave DHS daily access to view the personal data — including Social Security numbers and home address — of all the nation’s 77 million Medicaid enrollees. Neither agreement was announced publicly.

The extraordinary disclosure of such personal health data to deportation officials in the Trump administration’s far-reaching immigration crackdown immediately prompted the lawsuit over privacy concerns.

Immigration advocates have said the disclosure of personal data could cause alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children. Other efforts to crack down on illegal immigration have made schools, churches, courthouses and other everyday places feel perilous to immigrants and even U.S. citizens who fear getting caught up in a raid.

CMS in November said its intention to provide the data to ICE is “consistent with federal laws” and intended “to advance administration priorities related to immigration.”

The data sharing comes as the Trump administration has implemented an unprecedented immigration crackdown that has looped in agencies across the federal government and which has included sending the military and immigration agents into multiple Democratic-run cities.

The administration has also made other efforts to share data with immigration officials. In May, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants’ tax data with ICE to help agents locate and detain people living in the U.S. illegally.

The post included an image of an email with the sender and recipient redacted that stated the property would not host immigration agents.

“This is unacceptable,” the post reads, going on to say that the hotel was helping to “undermine and impede D.H.S. law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.”

In early December, President Trump railed against Somali immigrants, calling them “garbage” and saying they should return to where they came from. Minnesota is home to a large Somali community.

Hilton, a global hospitality company, encompasses more than 25 hotel brands, including Hampton Inn. As is the case with many branded hotels, the Hampton Inn in Lakeville is independently owned and operated, a Hilton spokesperson said via email, adding that the actions described by Homeland Security were not “reflective of Hilton values.” The company is investigating the incident, the spokesperson added.

“We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,” the statement reads.

Immigrant-rights activists in Minnesota have responded to the increased presence of immigration agents with deliberate efforts to make them feel unwelcome, including protesting late at night outside hotels where they suspect agents are staying.

Immigration lawyers Pooja Sundar and Stewart Dalley say Immigration New Zealand often gives offshore applicants vague or no reasons for why their temporary visas, such as visitor or family visas, are declined.

Unlike applicants already in New Zealand, offshore applicants generally cannot appeal decisions or respond to concerns before a decision is finalised.

“Where the officer knows in the back of the mind that nobody can review this decision, that’s not subject to an appeal, there’s no reconsideration, then where’s the incentive to make a proper decision?” Dalley said.

Sundar said the system disproportionately affects families seeking short-term visits for events or holidays, even when applicants provide evidence they will return home. She said offshore applicants often face a cycle of reapplying and paying fees again, with little clarity about what went wrong the first time.

“And in that position, the option is to reapply or to make a complaint. But the complaints process isn’t really going to go anywhere,” she said. “A credible system requires transparency, clear reasoning, and a genuine path to challenge flawed decisions.”

Dalley noted immigration decisions are excluded from investigation by the Human Rights Commission. Judicial review in the High Court is often the only option, but it comes at a high cost.

Immigration New Zealand maintains complaints numbers are now at their lowest since a revised feedback system was introduced in 2017.

What we know:

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took to social media to blast Hilton Hotels for allegedly refusing service to federal agents.

""When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously cancelled their reservations,"" DHS' social media post read.

In the post, DHS shared apparent screenshots showing an email thread coming from a ""@hilton.com"" address. In the screenshot, the hotel group allegedly said in an email that Hilton has ""found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be canceling your upcoming reservation.""

The other side:

FOX News' Bill Melugin and FOX 11's sister station KMSP-TV in Minneapolis both obtained the following statement below from Hilton in response to DHS' allegations against the hotel group:

""Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all. This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values. We are investigating this matter with this individual hotel, and can confirm that Hilton works with governments, law enforcement, and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone.""

Local perspective:

Last summer in Southern California, a small group of protesters were seen blasting music and staging loud demonstrations outside hotels housing ICE agents.

The demonstrations happened as the Trump administration deployed DHS law enforcement for months, and the National Guard for weeks, as part of Trump's push for mass deportations in politically blue U.S. cities.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.
“This is just another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration.” Administration officials were planning later in the week to provide separate briefings on the raid for all members of the House and Senate.","Top Trump administration officials on Monday afternoon were providing the first classified briefing for congressional leaders on the military raid in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife over the weekend, carried out without informing or consulting with Congress.

The briefing was for a select group known as the Gang of Eight — the House and Senate leaders from both parties, along with the chairmen and ranking members of each chamber’s intelligence committees — which is generally alerted to major military operations before, during or immediately after they occur. In this case, the Trump administration left the lawmakers in the dark, a decision that President Trump has said was made out of concern that they would leak details of the operation before it was carried out.

Those lawmakers were joined at the session by the Republican chairmen and senior Democrats on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were providing the briefing, along with John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Several lawmakers questioned why senior leaders on Capitol Hill had not been notified in advance about the raid, which captured Mr. Maduro and his wife to face drug trafficking charges in the United States.

By law, the Gang of Eight is supposed to be kept apprised of covert operations, although the Trump administration has not always done so.

“President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification and without any explanation to the American people,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement following the operation.

Mr. Rubio spoke with a number of Republican senators in the hours following the raid. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, an Intelligence Committee member who was among them, later said in a statement that “Congress should have been informed about the operation earlier and needs to be involved as this situation evolves.”

Mr. Rubio has rejected the argument that Congress needed to be consulted about the raid, maintaining in a series of interviews over the weekend that it did not require congressional approval because it was a law enforcement operation rather than a military invasion.

That explanation prompted the top senators in both parties who are charged with overseeing law enforcement matters to complain on Monday that they were not included in the classified briefing about Mr. Maduro’s capture. In a rare joint statement, Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, the ranking Democrat, said there was “no legitimate basis” for excluding them from the session.

“The administration’s refusal to acknowledge our committee’s indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro’s arrest,” they wrote.

During a news conference hours after the operation was carried out, Mr. Trump said he had circumvented Congress because he did not trust senior lawmakers to keep his plans confidential.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.

Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the president was legally required to brief lawmakers.

“Whether you think Congress leaks or not, the law says you must brief Congress,” he said during an interview on CNN on Sunday. “This is just another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration.”

Administration officials were planning later in the week to provide separate briefings on the raid for all members of the House and Senate.

District Court Opinion on H-1B Fee

A federal district court judge has issued an opinion upholding the legality of the $100,000 fee applied to certain H‑1B petitions, allowing the requirement to remain in effect as litigation continues. The decision rejects arguments that the administration exceeded its authority when implementing the fee through presidential proclamation.

Context and Related Developments

This ruling follows two major policy actions shaping the current H‑1B landscape. First, the administration’s entry restrictions outlined in Trump Signs Proclamation Restricting H‑1B Entry continue to limit the ability of certain foreign nationals to enter the United States. Second, the business community’s challenge to the fee structure, detailed in U.S. Chamber Lawsuit Challenges $100,000 H-1 B Fee, remains ongoing, indicating that additional court activity is still ahead.

What This Means for Employers

The ruling reinforces the government’s broad discretion to regulate the entry of foreign nationals, including through significant fee increases. As a result, employers should continue to plan for the substantial financial and operational impact this fee may have on FY 2027 H-1 B strategies and workforce planning.

Looking Ahead

Both developments remain subject to ongoing and potential litigation. In addition to those updates, the immediate impact of a September 2025 presidential proclamation requiring employers to pay a fee for filing an H-1B visa petition is narrower than some have assumed.

DC District Court Upholds Presidential Authority Under INA § 212(f)

In a recent decision in Chamber of Commerce v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld a presidential proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee on certain H-1B visa applicants, relying on the president’s broad authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 212(f) to condition the entry of nonimmigrants when deemed to be in the national interest.

Although the case was resolved on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court did not approach the matter as a conventional, fact-intensive Administrative Procedure Act challenge.

Instead, the court framed the dispute as one involving presidential authority and applied a deferential standard of review drawn from Trump v. Hawaii. Under this framework, the court expressly declined to weigh competing economic evidence regarding the H-1B program. The court accepted assertions in the proclamation concerning U.S. worker displacement and labor-market effects at face value and did not evaluate or resolve plaintiffs’ contrary evidence and policy arguments.

The court’s analysis focused on whether Congress, through INA § 212(f), delegated sufficiently broad authority to the president to impose conditions on entry. The court did not assess whether the proclamation accurately described the statutory structure or historical purpose of the H-1B program itself. Once it concluded that such authority existed, the court required only a rational connection between the proclamation’s stated objectives and a legitimate governmental interest.

Limitations on the Proclamation’s Scope

While the court’s decision has generated attention from stakeholders, the current proclamation applies in a limited set of circumstances. President Donald Trump’s administration issued the proclamation on Sept. 19, 2025, and it became effective on Sept. 21, 2025. It applies only to H-1B visa applicants seeking entry from outside the United States and only to cases filed on or after Sept. 21, 2025. It does not apply to change-of-status filings within the United States, H-1B extensions, amendments, or transfers for individuals already in H-1B status, or cap-exempt H-1B petitions. As a result, some employers and H-1B workers will not be directly affected.

Litigation Remains Ongoing

The D.C. court decision may not be the final word on the $100,000 fee. Two additional federal lawsuits challenging the fee remain pending in other jurisdictions, and the Chamber of Commerce has decided to appeal the D.C. court’s decision. These proceedings may result in further clarification—or potential limitation—of executive authority in this area. Accordingly, the legal framework governing the fee remains unsettled, and future court rulings may impact its implementation or scope.

DHS Finalizes Wage-Based Weighted Selection Rule for H-1B Cap Registrations

Separately, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has finalized a wage-based weighted selection system for H-1B cap-subject registrations, effective beginning with the FY 2027 registration season. This rule replaces the long-standing random lottery with a system that increases selection odds for higher-wage positions. Under the final rule, registrations tied to Level IV wages will be entered into the selection pool four times, Level III wages three times, Level II wages twice, and Level I wages once.

At the registration stage, employers must disclose the SOC code, area of intended employment, and the highest Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) wage level met or exceeded by the offered wage. For positions involving multiple worksites, the lowest applicable wage level must be used. Wage levels are locked in at the time of registration and must match the subsequently filed petition.

DHS Response to Public Comments

Despite receiving 2,731 public comments, DHS finalized its rule without modifying the regulatory text. The agency rejected requests for exemptions or alternative selection methodologies, emphasizing administrative feasibility, statutory discretion, and policy objectives. DHS concluded that entry-level positions would retain meaningful—though reduced—selection chances; that carve-outs for small businesses, specific industries, or U.S. degree holders would undermine the rule’s goals; and that OEWS wage levels already account for geographic and occupational variation. DHS also emphasized that cap-exempt programs continue to address health care and rural workforce needs.

Projected Selection Outcomes

DHS estimates that under the weighted system, Level I registrations will have an approximate 15.29% chance of selection, compared to 30.58% for Level II, 45.87% for Level III, and 61.16% for Level IV. By comparison, the historical random lottery produced an average selection rate of approximately 29.59% across all wage levels.

Potential for Litigation Challenging the Weighted Selection Rule

Although finalized, the wage-weighted selection rule may also face judicial challenges. Potential claims may include arguments that the INA requires random selection among properly filed petitions, that DHS exceeded its statutory authority, or that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act. Any resulting litigation may delay the implementation of DHS’s rule, result in injunctions, or require further agency action.

Practical Takeaways for Employers

Employers may need to avoid over-generalizing the reach of the proclamation, which applies only to certain consular-processed H-1B cases filed on or after Sept. 21, 2025. At the same time, employers should consider planning for continued uncertainty, as both the $100,000 fee and the wage-weighted lottery remain subject to ongoing and potential future litigation. Wage strategy and registration accuracy will be critical if the weighted system proceeds as scheduled, and employers may wish to explore alternative visa options and cap-exempt pathways as part of their FY 2027 workforce planning.

Takeaways

Taken together, these developments reflect an administration-wide emphasis on reshaping the H-1B program through executive authority and regulatory design, particularly at the points of entry and selection. At the same time, multiple legal challenges remain active, and further judicial review may occur.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2026-01/visa-Immigration-law-275578726%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=vnRUcc4q,N,,2026-01-05 18:58:13.136410

""Hilton works with governments, law ​enforcement and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

Federal officials in recent weeks have portrayed Minnesota's Somali community as a hotspot for fraud involving millions of federal dollars intended for social services. Immigrant-rights advocates have accused the administration of using the fraud investigations as ​an excuse to target Somali immigrants more broadly.

Shares of the hotel chain were down 1.5% in afternoon trading.

The nickname followed the informal name of the state's first detention center, ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" opened a few months earlier.
However, detainees at Florida's Deportation Depot and Alligator Alcatraz may not show up, as they are state-run facilities, according to an ICE spokesperson.","Florida has detained about 20,000 people and transferred them to federal immigration facilities.

The state has opened two of its own detention centers, nicknamed ""Deportation Depot"" and ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

Critics have raised concerns about conditions and due process, which officials have denied.

Florida detained about 20,000 people and transferred them to a federal immigration facility since state and law enforcement agencies in the state partnered with federal immigration enforcement, Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state officials said at a press conference in Sanderson Monday, Jan. 5.

Over 10,000 people were detained in Florida in Operation Tidal Wave, a state-run initiative led by law enforcement agencies coordinating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the rest were arrested by local law enforcement, DeSantis said, adding that 63% of those detained had previous arrests or convictions.

As of Nov. 30, 73.6% held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction, according to available data. Many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

The press conference was at Deportation Depot, one of Florida's two state-run immigration detention facilities. The other, nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" is on the edge of the Everglades in South Florida.

Critics have claimed that such detention centers are unsanitary and cruel, that ICE officials have swept up immigrants without criminal records and U.S. citizens in their arrests, and that detainees have been denied their civil rights and due process before being deported. Florida officials and the Department of Homeland Security have denied these claims.

Here's what to know about Florida's detention facilities.

What is Florida's Deportation Depot?

In September 2025, Florida opened ""Deportation Depot"" at the former Baker County Correctional Facility, which was closed due to staffing shortages. The nickname followed the informal name of the state's first detention center, ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" opened a few months earlier.

The center can hold more than 1,300 people, DeSantis said in his initial announcement, but in September an ICE spokesperson in an email to USA TODAY NETWORK said DHS was ""working with the state of Florida to expand ICE detention space by up to 2,000 beds.""

Other similarly named detention facilities that have sprung up in the past few months include the ""Speedway Slammer"" in Miami County, Indiana, the ""Cornhusker Clink"" at the Work Ethic Camp in McCook, Nebraska; and the ""Louisiana Lockup"" at the Louisiana State Penitentiary known as Angola Prison.

DeSantis at a press conference Sept. 2 announced a third planned detention center, to be called the ""Panhandle Pokey,"" somewhere in the western Panhandle but no location or timeframe was mentioned

Where is Deportation Depot?

The former Baker County Correctional Facility is at 20706 U.S. Highway 90 West in Sanderson, about 15 minutes away from the Lake City Airport.

What is Florida's Alligator Alcatraz?

Alligator Alcatraz used to be the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport, a 39-square-mile airport facility with a 10,500-foot runway. In June, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier posted a video on X with a pounding rock beat and a proposal for a temporary immigrant detention center in the Everglades with the promise that migrants arrested by ICE or local law enforcement had ""nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.""

The site was seized by the state, rushed into development and opened in under two weeks, with a planned capacity of 5,000 beds. Merch was offered, President Donald Trump came for a site visit and the site rapidly filled up. It also faced lawsuits and constant protests.

Less than two months after it opened, the Department of Homeland Security started moving people out of the center after a federal judge ordered a stop to new construction and blocked the transfer of any new detainees a preliminary injunction during a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and joined by the Miccosukee Tribe.

The site reopened in September after an appeals court allowed operations to continue until the judicial panel issues a final ruling on the matter.

""The mission continues on immigration enforcement,"" DeSantis said in a videotaped statement on social media. ""Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business.""

Where is Florida's Alligator Alcatraz?

The Alligator Alcatraz facility is in Ochopee, Florida, just north of Everglades National Park, about six miles from Big Cypress National Preserve, about 48 miles east of Naples, 45 miles west of Miami International Airport, and 40 air miles southwest of Boca Raton.

The facility was constructed in 1968 and originally known as the Everglades Jetport or Big Cypress Swamp Jetport, according to the National Park Service. It was intended to be the largest airport in the world, with six runways and a 1,000-foot-wide corridor linking it to both coasts. Most recently it was used as a pilot training facility.

How long do people stay in ICE detention centers?

Detention can run from a few days to more than a year, depending on the immigrant's situation and several other variables.

Immigrants who agree to return to their home country may only stay locked up a few days, experts said. Immigrants who have claimed asylum or have pending court cases may be in for months as cases work through the system. People who receive final orders of removal may be detained for up to 180 days while ICE arranges their deportation but that may go longer if complications come in, such as if the home country won't accept them.

Different organizations have offered different ""average"" stays. In 2019, the American Immigration Council said an average stay was 55 days while people defending themselves in court were regularly held longer than six months. A study in 2012 by TRAC Reports suggested that the group with the largest percentage of detainment over six months were people who were entitled to be in the U.S. and had been detained by mistake.

Is ICE detention the same as jail?

Jails are generally used to detain people awaiting trial or sentencing, and those facing shorter sentences. They are operated by local law enforcement such as sheriff's departments or corrections departments. Once the case is resolved or the sentence is complete, the inmates are released.

Immigration detention centers are facilities where people believed to be in the country illegally are kept until they can either be returned to their home country or another country that agrees to take them, or they prove their status as legal citizens.

There have been multiple reports of ICE rapidly moving detainees to facilities far from where they were captured, drawing accusations of intentionally moving them away from families and attorneys and making locating them more difficult. A report from Amnesty International claimed that detainees are being mistreated at Alligator Alcatraz and at Krome North Processing Center, a federally-run immigration detention and processing center in Miami, with some subject to what they called ""torture.""

State officials have denied these claims.

Can you have your phone in ICE detention?

When a person is detained by ICE, they will go through processing, fingerprints and photographs will be taken, and personal belongings will likely be confiscated

U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service detention standards require detainees to have ""reasonable and equitable access"" to telephones during facility waking hours, with at least one telephone for every 25 detainees held. Detainees will be allowed to make collect calls, or direct calls for:

Local immigration courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals

Federal and State courts where the detainee is or may become involved in a legal proceeding

Consular officials

Legal service providers, in pursuit of legal representation or to engage in consultation concerning the detainee's expedited removal case

A government office, to obtain documents relevant to his/her immigration case

A personal or family emergency, or when the detainee can otherwise demonstrate a compelling need

How do I find if someone has been detained by ICE?

You can use ICE’s online detainee locator at locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search to find people using their date of birth and country of origin, or their nine-digit A-Num.

However, detainees at Florida's Deportation Depot and Alligator Alcatraz may not show up, as they are state-run facilities, according to an ICE spokesperson.

What can I do if I fear an ICE raid?

The National Immigration Resource Center recommends:

Gather important documents for all family members showing how long each one has been in the United States. This can include birth certificates, U.S. income tax returns, utility bills, leases, school records, medical records or bank records. Put copies into a secure online folder or location you can access by phone.

Identify your emergency contacts, memorize their phone numbers and make sure your contact can access all of your documents.

Provide your child’s school or daycare with an emergency contact to pick up your child in case you are detained.

You, your family or emergency contacts can contact the local ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office to initiate an ICE Case Review process. You can find your local ERO office here. Have supporting documents ready.

All about the oil: Trump left little room for doubt after declaring that his top priority in Venezuela’s transition would be regrowing its oil industry and exports.","MADURO IN COURT: Nicolás Maduro made his first appearance in federal court in Manhattan today following his capture by U.S. forces this weekend. Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug-trafficking charges in the first hearing of what will likely be a lengthy legal battle, POLITICO’s Erica Orden reports from New York. “I’m innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country,” Maduro told the judge. “I am a kidnapped president, prisoner of war,” he added later.

Must read: “92-year-old judge handling Maduro case ‘doesn’t give a s--t what anyone thinks about him’” by POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein and Erica: Maduro’s case has come before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a Clinton appointee and 92-year-old judge “with a stubborn streak and an often unorthodox approach to running his courtroom.”

THE CATCH-UP

BACK TO THE HILL: Congress is officially back. And lawmakers are returning to the Hill to a firestorm of different conflicts to manage, both new and old headaches coming together as the 2026 legislative calendar kicks off.

This week alone, both sides of Congress will confront the sudden intervention in Venezuela, a roundtable on the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and hearing on misuse of federal funds in Minnesota, a vote in the House on the expired Affordable Care Act tax credits — and, of course, the small matter of funding the government for the next fiscal year. Buckle in.

Kicking things off: After a bruising clash last year, funding the government for the remainder of this fiscal year could prove to be the least contentious issue, if today offers any indication. In a bicameral breakthrough, top appropriators this morning released the text of the three-bill funding package to pass ahead of the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline, POLITICO’s Jennifer Scholtes and Meredith Lee Hill report. As GOP leaders start to whip votes, they’re planning to put the package to a vote in the House on Thursday.

The compromise comes after more than a month of negotiations, with the deal including funding for the Energy, Commerce, Interior and Justice departments, as well as water programs, the EPA and federal science initiatives until Sept. 30. Speaker Mike Johnson, while decrying the prospects of an “omnibus” package, touted the minibus as spending less than past funding bills. And the deal received ringing endorsements in statements from both top Democratic appropriators — Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Sen. Patty Murray.

But there are still some funding hurdles ahead: Congress has six other spending bills to move forward before the deadline — which include some of the biggest budgets covering the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.

The thorny health care debate that drew outsized attention before the break will come up again this week. The discharge petition for a potential three-year extension of the expired Affordable Care Act subsidies could get a procedural vote on Wednesday, with a final vote on passage in the House on Thursday, Meredith reports. But even if it passes the House, it’s likely doomed in the Senate.

Looming over all of this is Venezuela, which will likely dominate much of the discussion on the Hill this week. Top congressional leaders and senior House and Senate members from Intelligence, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations committees will be briefed today by top administration officials at 5:30 p.m. Despite general support for the president’s move, internally some Republicans are feeling misled by the administration on the endgame in Venezuela, especially amid mixed messaging over who is actually running Venezuela, POLITICO’s Calen Razor writes.

As lawmakers shuffle back to D.C., they’re returning to crunch time ahead of the midterms. Republicans’ razor-thin majority — which is only getting narrower — will be under ever more scrutiny. But as GOP members start to reflect on the current political temperature, some are questioning a change in leadership if they hold onto power, MS NOW’s Mychael Schnell reports. “Expect the silent majority in the GOP conference to push for entirely new faces, and an entirely new approach, in the next Congress,” one lawmaker told MS NOW. And some GOP lawmakers want 2026 to be about reclaiming Congress’ authority, per NOTUS’ Riley Rogerson.

COME IN, CAP. KELLY: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced this morning that the Pentagon is taking steps to demote Sen. Mark Kelly’s (D-Ariz.) retirement rank and pay following his participation in a November video telling service members to defy illegal orders, POLITICO’s Leo Shane III and Connor O’Brien report. Hegseth said the video was part of a “pattern of reckless misconduct.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly jumped to Kelly’s defense, calling the move “a despicable act of political retribution.”

FOR YOUR RADAR: Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) is stepping down as the ranking Democrat on the House China panel, POLITICO’s Nick Wu reports, with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) taking over as ranking member.

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. VENEZUELA FALLOUT: Following a whirlwind weekend of U.S. intervention in Venezuela, around a dozen oil tankers carrying Venezuelan oil have left the country since the start of 2026 — a potential violation of the strict oil blockade that remains in effect after Maduro’s capture, per Reuters. The United Nations Security Council is holding an emergency meeting on the U.S. raid today, with Secretary-General António Guterres saying he is “deeply concerned” about instability in the region, per NYT.

How it’s playing: WaPo surveyed 1,004 Americans on the intervention and found an even split between approval and disapproval of the operation, while a 63 percent majority said it should have required congressional authorization. In South Florida, there’s more hope among Venezuelan Americans and Venezuelans that they might be able to return to the country, NYT’s Patricia Mazzei writes.

The view from Caracas: Venezuelans are struggling to understand what will come next after this weekend’s stunning events, with confusion and some dread about more conflict raging across the capital city, WaPo’s Ana Vanessa Herrero and Terrence McCoy report from Caracas. And while Maduro may be out of power, the country’s top enforcers — Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino — still hold control of the military, and could present a wild card for Trump to deal with, WSJ’s Ryan Dubé writes.

All about the oil: Trump left little room for doubt after declaring that his top priority in Venezuela’s transition would be regrowing its oil industry and exports. But with that objective comes a big test for U.S. firms on how much risk they can tolerate, and how much they will invest without any guarantees on Venezuela’s future, Axios’ Ben Geman reports. China also looms large over the oil equation. It has loaned billions to the country to bring in Venezuelan oil, and now also faces a squeeze and questions about a return on investment, per NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson.

2. THE DON-ROE DOCTRINE: Trump’s ever-expanding foreign policy portfolio and eye toward intervention is raising red flags among world leaders. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen doubled down in defense of Greenland, calling on Trump to “stop the threats” while Greenland retains its right to self-determination, per NYT. Standing with Denmark is one of Trump’s big European allies, British PM Keir Starmer. “Denmark is a close European ally, a close NATO ally, and the future therefore has to be for Greenland [and] for the Kingdom of Denmark,” Stamer said this morning, POLITICO’s Noah Keate reports in London.

Also hitting back: Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who wrote on X this morning, “If you detain a president whom much of my people want and respect, you will unleash the people’s jaguar.” Petro also said he “asked the people to defend the president against any illegitimate violent act,” while the country’s defense minister toed a more diplomatic line, NYT’s Genevieve Glatsky reports.

Troubled waters: Iran has been struggling to quiet a wave of protests in the country that so far has killed 17 people, but Trump’s threats are complicating the country’s options, Reuters’ Parisa Hafezi writes. “These twin pressures have narrowed Tehran’s room for manoeuvre … with few viable options and high risks on every path,” one Iranian official told Reuters. Meanwhile in Nigeria, Muslims in the country are living in fear following the Christmas Day strikes and continued threats from Trump, per NYT.

The big picture: The Atlantic’s Missy Ryan and Ashley Parker outline Trump’s tack on foreign policy with a more, ahem, colorful moniker. We’ll call it the FAFO Doctrine. “In [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio’s telling, the stunning events in Venezuela on Saturday illustrate an essential truth — possibly the essential truth — about Donald Trump’s presidency: Global leaders cross him at their peril,” they write.

3. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Ad it up: Texas state Rep. James Talarico is going up with the first statewide TV ad in the Democratic Senate primary. The seven-figure buy frames Talarico as a fighter, with a message focused on fighting against corruption and for affordability. Watch the 30-second spot here

4. HE’S OUT: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced this morning that he is dropping his bid for reelection, stepping away from the prospect of a third term in office, POLITICO’s Elena Schneider reports. The shock news comes as Republicans have sought to tie him to a spiraling controversy that has resulted in a federal probe into a massive welfare fraud scandal in the state and a crackdown from Trump on the state’s Somali community.

What Walz is saying: “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he wrote in his statement on X. It’s a remarkable fall for Walz, who gained a national profile in 2024 as the Democratic nominee for vice president.

Who comes next: Walz met with Sen. Amy Klobuchar to discuss the campaign yesterday, Elena reports, and the onetime presidential candidate is “receiving encouragement to run and she’s seriously considering it but has not decided on her plans.” Her entry would be welcome news for Democrats in a competitive state given her past success in running ahead of others in her party. Dean Phillips wrote on X that he won’t enter the race.

What comes next: “2,000 federal agents deploying to Minneapolis in immigration crackdown, fraud probe,” by CBS’ Nicole Sganga and Camilo Montoya-Galvez: “The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations … The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration’s expanded immigration crackdown in the new year.” CBP Commander Gregory Bovino is expected “to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.”

5. TRADING SPACES: “OECD Finalizes Agreement on Global Minimum Tax,” by Bloomberg’s Caitlin Reilly and Daniel Flatley: “The US and more than 100 other countries finalized an agreement that would exempt American companies from some foreign taxes, the culmination of a months-long effort to create a carve-out from a corporate global minimum levy. The deal excludes US-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax negotiated through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development, or OECD. … Under the agreement, other countries would be effectively blocked from imposing additional taxes on foreign subsidiaries of US multinationals.”

6. LIVE FROM NEW YORK: “New York Gov. Kathy Hochul confronts a rising populist tide,” by POLITICO’s Nick Reisman: “Hochul is trying to center her reelection campaign on the cost of living. … She faces left-flank pressure to raise taxes on rich people so that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s expensive agenda comes to fruition. On the right, Republicans have pledged to exploit any effort to support Mamdani’s goals … Yet the governor is showing signs that she’s willing to blend the policies of both the mercurial president and rookie mayor — making cost concerns a centerpiece for the coming year amid the expectation voters will reward her for sympathizing with their pocketbook problems.”

7. FOR YOUR RADAR: “Man in custody after windows broken at JD Vance’s home, Secret Service says,” by WaPo’s Jennifer Hassan: “U.S. Secret Service agents assigned to the Ohio home of Vice President JD Vance ‘physically detained’ a man at the property early Monday shortly after midnight after windows were broken there. … The Secret Service said it is coordinating with the Cincinnati police and the U.S. attorney’s office as charging decisions are reviewed.” What Vance is saying: “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows,” he wrote on X. “I’m grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly. We weren’t even home as we had returned already to DC.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

IS THE BROMANCE BACK? — Elon Musk had dinner this weekend with Donald Trump and Melania Trump. “2026 is going to be amazing!” he posted on X.

THE LATEST D.C. DATA — “For the second year, D.C.’s annual homicide toll declined,” by WaPo’s Emma Uber: “In 2025, for the first time since 2017, fewer than 150 people were slain in D.C., continuing a decline in violent crime that began in 2024. D.C. experienced a 32 percent drop in homicides for the second consecutive year, according to city data, with police investigating 127 homicides in 2025 compared to 187 in 2024 and 274 the year before, the deadliest year in more than two decades. There were also fewer shootings, robberies, carjackings and instances of sexual abuse reported last year, data shows.”

TRANSITIONS — Evan Nash is now political director for Eric Conroy’s congressional campaign in Ohio. He previously worked in Sen. Bernie Moreno’s (R-Ohio) office. … Donald Gips and Francine Lamoriello are joining DGA Group. Gips, a former ambassador, previously led the Skoll Foundation. Lamoriello previously worked at the Personal Care Products Council. … Manny Orozco is joining Richard Lamondin’s congressional campaign as campaign manager. He previously worked for Miami-Dade County.

WELCOME TO THE WORLD — Poorvie Bishnoi, VP at Monument Advocacy, and Mayank Bishnoi, the Global Policy Counsel for Texas Instruments, welcomed Rhys Kellen Bishnoi on Dec. 26, 2025. He joins big brother Zane.

Why is Hilton Hotels siding with murderers and rapists to deliberately undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws?”

A spokesperson for Hilton Hotels said the hotel which cancelled the reservations is ""independently owned and operated"" but that Hilton Hotels is investigating the matter.

""Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values. We are investigating this matter with this individual hotel, and can confirm that Hilton works with governments, law enforcement and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone.""

Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, federal immigration crackdowns have taken place in major cities across the country such as Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

And now in light of the uncovering of rampant fraud within Minnesota’s social services and Medicaid programs, DHS has sent Homeland Security Investigations to the state.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the United States with upwards of 100,000 people who are a part of the Somalian diaspora. The Trump administration said it is looking into revoking the citizenship of Somalians linked to the fraud.

The Supreme Court, without offering an opinion about the lawmakers’ arguments, sent the case to the circuit court.
Amid the controversy, state lawmakers and members of Congress were allowed to visit the facility, though Democrats said the visit was tightly controlled and left unanswered questions.
In addition to citing laws about legislators having access to correctional facilities, the lawsuit also raised constitutional separation-of-powers arguments.
The case about the legislators’ access has been assigned to Leon County Circuit Judge Jonathan Sjostrom.","Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration has fired back at a lawsuit filed by Democratic lawmakers seeking access to a controversial immigrant-detention center in the Everglades, saying they don’t have a legal right to enter the facility “at their pleasure.”

Five lawmakers filed the lawsuit in July after they made an unannounced visit to the facility dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz” but were denied access. They contended the denial was unconstitutional and violated state laws allowing access by legislators to correctional institutions.

But attorneys for DeSantis and state Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie, in a response filed last week in Leon County circuit court, said the laws that the Democrats “invoked do not entitle them as individual legislators to enter Alligator Alcatraz at their pleasure.”

In part, the response said the access laws do not apply to the immigrant-detention facility.

“The facility is not a ‘state correctional institution’ because it is not a ‘prison’ or ‘other correctional facility,’” the response said, partially quoting one law. “‘Prisons’ and ‘correctional facilities’ describe facilities that are part of the criminal justice system. Instead, Alligator Alcatraz is a short-term civil detention facility in which illegal aliens are held under the authority of the federal government and processed for deportation.”

Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville, and Rep. Michele Rayner, D-St. Petersburg, went to the center on July 3 “to inspect the state detention facility, evaluate the use of taxpayer funds and assess safety pursuant to Florida statutory guidelines,” the lawsuit said.

“The petitioners (the lawmakers) attempted to arrive unannounced so that they could observe the unadulterated conditions of the facility,” the lawsuit said. “The unannounced inspection of the facility falls squarely within the petitioners’ purview and oversight duties as state officers and members of the Florida Legislature.”

The lawsuit was filed at the Florida Supreme Court on July 10, seeking what is known as a “writ of quo warranto” directing DeSantis and Guthrie to allow lawmakers unannounced access to the facility. The Supreme Court, without offering an opinion about the lawmakers’ arguments, sent the case to the circuit court.

Amid the controversy, state lawmakers and members of Congress were allowed to visit the facility, though Democrats said the visit was tightly controlled and left unanswered questions.

In addition to citing laws about legislators having access to correctional facilities, the lawsuit also raised constitutional separation-of-powers arguments.

“The denial of the petitioners’ access to the ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention facility was an unconstitutional executive overreach because it prevented the duly elected members of the Florida Legislature from exercising their powers,” the lawsuit said. “The petitioners’ denial of entry and access restricted the Legislature’s independence as a coequal branch of government.”

But in the response last week, the DeSantis administration attorneys said the state Constitution gives the Legislature oversight authority, and a law authorizes legislative committees to carry out investigations. But the administration attorneys said individual lawmakers don’t have such powers.

“Far from the governor or FDEM (the Division of Emergency Management) usurping the authority of another branch of government, it is petitioners who attempt to usurp the authority of the Legislature and its committees by taking matters into their own hands,” the response said.

The state opened the detention center this summer at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, which had long been used for flight training, as DeSantis and other Florida Republican leaders sought to assist President Donald Trump’s mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. The facility, which is surrounded by the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, has also led to separate legal battles in federal court.

It was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests,” Cypress wrote.
The Tribe said it will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Florida delegation and the federal government.

Trump vetoes Miccosukee flood protection, citing tribe’s opposition to ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

In a statement to the Phoenix, the tribe wrote that it has “long supported President Trump’s commitment to Everglades restoration for the benefit of America’s public lands.”

“The Tribe has a constitutional duty to protect and defend the Everglades ecosystem, our traditional homelands. We never sought to obstruct the President’s immigration agenda. Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments,” Chairman Talbert Cypress wrote.

He added that the tribe was “disappointed to learn that the White House vetoed a measure intended to mitigate restoration impacts on a Tribal village.”

The bill, HR 504, called upon the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe “to take appropriate actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding events.”

Trump vetoed the bill by Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Giménez despite widespread congressional support.

Politico reported Monday that the House will vote Thursday whether to override two vetoes, one being HR 504. That outlet reported “senior House Republicans and Democrats generally expect the chamber will approve the overrides in a rare rebuke of Trump.” However, “Less clear is whether either override vote would have enough support in the Senate.”

The second veto was a bill relating to federal funding for a Colorado water pipeline, also sponsored by a Republican. Democrats there believe the veto was politically motivated, Colorado Newsline reported.

In his veto letter, the president blamed the tribe for having “actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe is part of a lawsuit against the state, claiming planners behind an immigration detention center in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility.

“The measure reflected years of bipartisan work and was intended to clarify land status and support basic protections for tribal members who have lived in this area for generations — before the roads and canals were built, and before Everglades National Park was created. It was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests,” Cypress wrote.

Trump, via his veto letter published Dec. 30 by the White House, said the tribe during former President Joe Biden’s administration sought “special treatment from the Federal Government.”

“My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country,” Trump wrote.

The Tribe said it will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Florida delegation and the federal government.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.","Top Trump administration officials are scheduled on Monday afternoon to provide the first classified briefing for congressional leaders on the military raid that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife over the weekend, carried out in Venezuela without informing or consulting with Congress.

The briefing is to include a select group known as the Gang of Eight — the House and Senate leaders from both parties, along with the chairmen and ranking members of each chamber’s intelligence committees — which is generally alerted to major military operations before, during or immediately after they occur. In this case, the Trump administration left the lawmakers in the dark, a decision that President Trump has said was made out of concern that they would leak details of the operation before it was carried out.

Those lawmakers are to be joined by the Republican chairmen and senior Democrats on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are scheduled to provide the briefing, along with John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to multiple people familiar with the planned meeting who were not authorized to discuss it.

Several lawmakers questioned why senior leaders on Capitol Hill had not been notified in advance about the raid, which captured Mr. Maduro and his wife to face drug trafficking charges in the United States.

By law, the Gang of Eight is supposed to be kept apprised of covert operations, although the Trump administration has not always done so.

“President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification and without any explanation to the American people,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement following the operation.

Mr. Rubio spoke with a number of Republican senators in the hours following the raid. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, an Intelligence Committee member who was among them, later said in a statement that “Congress should have been informed about the operation earlier and needs to be involved as this situation evolves.”

Mr. Rubio has rejected the argument that Congress needed to be informed, and said in a series of interviews over the weekend that the operation did not require congressional approval because it was a law enforcement operation rather than a military invasion.

During a news conference hours after the operation was carried out, Mr. Trump said he had circumvented Congress because he did not trust senior lawmakers to keep his plans confidential.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.

Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the president was legally required to brief lawmakers.

“Whether you think Congress leaks or not, the law says you must brief Congress,” he said during an interview on CNN on Sunday. “This is just another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/05/multimedia/05us-venezuela-gang-of-eight-twgj/05us-venezuela-gang-of-eight-twgj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 16:57:27.813500

Ron DeSantis is set to hold a press conference on Monday morning at the Baker Correctional Institution, the facility officials call “Deportation Depot.”

State Capitol reporter Forrest Saunders continues to cover Florida's second migrant detention and deportation center, which Gov. DeSantis has heralded, while civil rights and immigration advocacy groups have condemned the facilities. Those groups have been seeking closure of both migrant detention centers in Baker County and the Everglades, as well as more transparency over their operations.

At a news conference at the Baker Correctional Institution’s “Deportation Depot,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida is leading the nation in immigration enforcement through close coordination with the Trump administration. He announced that Operation Tidal Wave has topped 10,000 arrests of undocumented, with officials claiming about 63% involved people with prior criminal records, and nearly 20,000 arrests statewide when local efforts are included.

DeSantis and Florida Cabinet members described Florida’s detention sites as temporary support to speed deportations while DHS expands capacity, confirming nearly 100 deportation flights so far from Baker alone. He said two additional detention facilities (the ""Panhandle Pokey"" and a yet-to-be-determined South Florida site) are pending federal approval. Speakers across state agencies touted arrests tied to violent crime, fraud, and trafficking, and argued that the strategy deters illegal immigration and improves public safety. They framed Florida’s approach as a model for other states.

DeSantis also said to expect details on his upcoming legislative priorities, like property insurance and tax relief, later this week.

In his first comments on the ouster, DeSantis said Venezuela was devastated by what he called Marxist rule under Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, arguing the country went from prosperous to repressive and poor. He claimed Maduro is tied to drug trafficking and accused his government of releasing prisoners and sending people toward the U.S. border under the Biden administration. DeSantis pointed to South Florida’s large Venezuelan community as proof of the regime’s failures and said he hopes Venezuelans can ultimately free themselves from Maduro’s rule.

When a state violates the human rights of its people, my office is among those who are charged with raising the alarm.
The human rights of Venezuelans are not a bargaining chip, or a point to be scored.
This is not about choosing between unilateral intervention that runs contrary to international law, or ignoring years of human rights violations.","The US military operation in Venezuela undermines a fundamental principle of international law, agreed after the horrors of two world wars and the Holocaust: states must not use force to pursue their territorial claims or political demands.

I am deeply disturbed by these events – and by some of the reactions I have seen. A narrative is emerging that seeks to justify the US military intervention as a response to the Nicolás Maduro government’s appalling human rights record.

My office has long condemned serious human rights violations by the Venezuelan authorities. We have reported, monitored and warned about the situation inside Venezuela – most recently, just before Christmas. We have consistently called for an end to unfair trials, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, the persecution of political opponents and sweeping restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. We have urged independent investigations and accountability. For many years, my team in Venezuela advocated for the release of human rights defenders, monitored trials and engaged with civil society and the opposition, as well as state institutions.

Our detailed monitoring and reporting were intended to prompt action. When a state violates the human rights of its people, my office is among those who are charged with raising the alarm. It is up to the international community to use the lawful tools and mechanisms at its disposal, so that states respect their human rights obligations. These tools could include diplomatic leverage and investments in accountability. But these tools and mechanisms were not deployed effectively to influence the government of Venezuela.

Far from being a victory for human rights, this military intervention – in contravention of Venezuelan sovereignty and the UN charter – damages the architecture of international security, making every country less safe. It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like, and weakens the only mechanism we have to prevent a third world war, namely the United Nations. No amount of deception and distraction can alter these facts.

Beyond the legal arguments, history teaches us that while attempts at regime change may initially be greeted by relief, they often lead to massive human rights violations, dangerous chaos and protracted violent conflict.

The human rights of Venezuelans are not a bargaining chip, or a point to be scored. I have visited Venezuela and spoken with its people, and I feel deeply for them at this moment. I feel for those waiting desperately for news about their loved ones; for families who have been separated; and for all those with empty places at their tables during this holiday season. Human rights need to be central to Venezuela’s future – not an afterthought, taking a back seat to negotiations around the exploitation of fossil fuels. The country’s future must be decided by its people.

More broadly, human rights cannot be treated like an ideological ping-pong ball. We cannot afford for our rights to be instrumentalised: invoked when they’re convenient, and vilified when they’re not. I fear for people in the region and around the world who are deeply alarmed by what this breach in international law means for their own safety and security. This is not about choosing between unilateral intervention that runs contrary to international law, or ignoring years of human rights violations. We need more fidelity to human rights law around the world, not less.

Venezuelan society needs healing. It needs justice to overcome polarisation and to repair its social and economic fabric. It does not need militarisation, violence or further uncertainty and instability.

Above all, Venezuela needs the international community to stop paying lip service to human rights, and to stand up for the UN charter and for international law. The alternative will have terrible consequences around the world.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b786fa786d8511bb32ce4b7ff102aa27b8cdb70f/323_87_2690_2153/master/2690.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=da55f6c6c51d045046019b065e430d27",N,,2026-01-05 18:58:05.143354

Ron DeSantis said Monday.

Florida officials were waiting for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to sign off on the third detention center in the state's Panhandle, DeSantis said at a news conference outside the facility which was Florida's second immigration detention center, dubbed “Deportation Deport,” at the former Baker Correctional Institution in northeast Florida.

“So, if they approve, we will open,” DeSantis said. “If they don't, then we will stand by, and that's fine. But I think it should be approved since I don't think they're where they need to be on detention space.”

The governor said there was “another option potentially” in South Florida, where state officials already have constructed an immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” at a remote airstrip in the Florida Everglades.

When asked by email about the specific locations of the two potential detention facilities, DeSantis press secretary Molly Best said the Panhandle location would be announced once it's approved by federal officials.

“Until this and the proposed additional South Florida location have been approved and finalized, we are unable to provide additional details. Stay tuned!” Best said.

DeSantis said that there had been 10,000 arrests of people in the U.S. illegally in Florida during the past year through a state initiative with federal law enforcement, and that local law enforcement had made an additional 10,000 arrests for a total of 20,000 arrests. Under the state initiative, 63% of those arrested had a criminal arrest or conviction, DeSantis said.

Florida has led other states in constructing facilities to support President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, with DeSantis saying the Trump administration needs the additional capacity to hold and deport more immigrants. The Trump administration has trumpeted the Republican governors’ efforts to expand their immigration detention capacity, calling Florida’s partnership a model for other state-run holding facilities.

Attorneys for detainees at the Everglades facility have called the conditions deplorable, writing in court documents that rainwater floods their tents and officers go cell-to-cell pressuring detainees to sign voluntary removal orders before they’re allowed to consult their attorneys.

Three federal lawsuits in Florida are challenging practices at the Everglades facility.

In one lawsuit, detainees are asking for the facility to be closed since immigration is a federal issue, and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate it under federal law. In a second lawsuit, detainees were seeking a ruling that would ensure that they have access to confidential communications with their attorneys.

In the third lawsuit, a federal judge in Miami last summer ordered the facility to wind down operations over two months because officials had failed to do a review of the detention center’s environmental impact. But an appellate court panel put that decision on hold for the time being, allowing the facility to stay open.

Spain isn’t naïve about immigration.

It has border pressure, racism, and a loud far-right party.

What Spain does not have is the American habit of pretending immigration is an existential threat instead of an economic and demographic opportunity.

After living in Spain for two years, the contrast is impossible to ignore: Spain integrates immigrants more effectively than the United States and, in many ways, better than parts of Northern Europe.

Not because it’s kinder, but because it’s more honest.

And that honesty offers a blueprint for what a serious, winnable U.S. progressive immigration platform could look like, without the open-borders delusion or culture-war bait.

1. Spain Says the Quiet Part Out Loud

Spain openly acknowledges something U.S. politicians treat like contraband:

Immigrants are necessary for the country to function.

Spain has one of the lowest birth rates in the world (1.16 births per woman in 2023, according to Spain’s National Statistics Institute), a rapidly aging population, and a pension system that relies on workers. The math isn’t ideological — it’s demographic.

The U.S. is in the same position:

U.S. birth rates are near historic lows (CDC).

Workforce aging is accelerating (U.S. Census Bureau).

Social Security faces long-term solvency challenges (SSA Trustees Report).

Meanwhile, immigrants account for a large share of labor force growth (Brookings), start businesses at higher rates than native-born Americans (NBER), and contribute more in taxes than they consume in benefits overall (National Academies of Sciences).

Spain frames immigration as workforce infrastructure.

The U.S. frames it as a cultural threat.

Only one of those approaches is grounded in reality.

A Hilton-branded hotel in Minneapolis is facing scrutiny after allegedly canceling reservations made by federal immigration agents, prompting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to publicly question the decision.

Emails that ICE shared on social media appear to show staff at the Hampton Inn by Hilton Lakeville Minneapolis informing individuals associated with reservations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the property would not allow ICE or other immigration agents to stay.

Hilton did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

""We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property. If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation,"" an email from a staff member at the Hilton-branded hotel allegedly reads.

""Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property.""

A follow-up email several hours later then allegedly stated, ""After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation. You should see a proper cancellation email in your inbox shortly from Hilton.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital in a statement: ""Hilton has launched a coordinated campaign in Minneapolis to REFUSE service to DHS law enforcement. When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations.""

""This is UNACCEPTABLE,"" said McLaughlin. ""Why is Hilton Hotels siding with murderers and rapists to deliberately undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws?""

The exchange prompted the official ICE account on X to post screenshots of the conversation.

American Victimhood In November, the Trump administration released its National Security Strategy.
That’s also why the Trump administration resumed its Guantánamo operations after the ruling by sending 22 Cubans to the base.
In March, Judge James Boasberg ordered planes carrying migrants to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison to turn around and return to the United States.
But even if Noem and the Trump administration are found to be in criminal contempt, we can hardly imagine any administration officials facing any semblance of accountability.","At a press conference on January 3, President Donald Trump announced that the United States had carried out strikes on Venezuela and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Trump alleged that Maduro oversaw the Cartel de los Soles and had sent members of the Tren de Aragua gang to the United States to terrorize Americans. Unlike previous U.S. presidents, who typically denied ulterior motives behind similarly brazen acts of regime change — such as access and exploitation to natural resources — Trump was explicit about the U.S.’s interest in Venezuelan oil. Notably absent from the press conference, which also featured remarks from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan “Raizin” Caine, was any reference to the law or to what legal authority could possibly justify the strikes on Venezuela or the abduction of Maduro and Flores. Despite this absence of legal justification, Trump asserted that Maduro and his wife would “soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil.” In this conception of American “justice,” the contradiction of violating the law in order to achieve justice is something that the U.S. need not reckon with.

“Kill everybody” was the command that Hegseth reportedly issued on September 2 to authorize a double-tap strike on a Caribbean boat the U.S. claimed was carrying drug traffickers. As additional strikes followed, controversy escalated over whether the September 2 attack constituted a war crime — prompting both Democrats and some Republicans to call for a formal investigation. However, the discussion about whether or not a war crime had been committed allowed a central myth behind the U.S.’s murderous actions to be ignored — that is, that the U.S. was not at war with Venezuela. Thus, what was committed was a crime — and one that no one in the administration will presumably be held accountable for. This because the Trump administration has demonstrated over and over again that laws often function less as constraints than as optional guidelines for those in power. In an op-ed for The Hill titled “War is hell, but that should never excuse war crimes,” Marine Corps veteran Jos Joseph condemns Trump and Hegseth’s actions and points to past abuses during the “war on terror” — such as the Haditha massacre in Iraq — as stark examples of what happens when legal limits are completely disregarded. Yet war crimes remain meaningful only to the extent that there is a will to enforce accountability and to acknowledge that such violations exist in the first place. When “Meet the Press” recently asked Trump whether the president is obligated to uphold the Constitution, his response — “I don’t know” — laid bare his view of the law not as a binding force, but as something malleable for those who wield state power. Moreover, given the almost near certainty that any government officials could be or will be held accountable for war crimes, the possibility of being held accountable for other crimes is nonexistent.

American Victimhood

In November, the Trump administration released its National Security Strategy. Beyond celebrating and applauding Trump’s leadership and providing a definition of “American strategy,” the document includes a section titled “What should the United States want.” The section starts with the following sentence: “First and foremost, we want the continued survival and safety of the United States as an independent, sovereign republic whose government secures the God-given natural rights of its citizens and prioritizes their well-being and interests.” Strongly rooted in the construction of the United States as a perpetual and unwarranted victim, the section outlines the need for the U.S. to protect its territory, to have full control over its borders, and to have a well-oiled military machine to protect its interests. This victim narrative, particularly utilized in the articulated right of the United States to protect its territory, rings especially violent after Venezuelan sovereignty was completely violated by U.S. strikes on the country and the abduction of Maduro and his wife.

This rhetoric of victimhood is not unique to Trump and his administration. It has been a strategic throughline of the “war on terror” — used to legitimize otherwise indefensible policies and legal interventions. In her article “Legitimizing the ‘War on Terror’: Political Myth in Official-Level Rhetoric,” scholar Joanne Esch explains how narratives of U.S. victimization draw on the myth of American exceptionalism: the belief that the United States is a uniquely aggrieved nation entitled to extraordinary responses. Similarly, scholars Jessie Barton Hronešová and Daniel Kreiss describe this manipulation of grievance by those in power as “hijacked victimhood,” a tactic through which dominant groups frame themselves as under attack in order to justify the expansion of coercive state power.

According to Hronešová and Kreiss, “Hijacked victimhood narratives delegitimize the victimhood of those whom they characterize as threats to the power of dominant groups — refugees, minorities, historically oppressed groups, and those who represent them — and dilute efforts at redress and justice.” Hijacked victimhood narratives have served as a powerful and convenient tool for Trump and his administration to justify state violence under the guise of protecting the United States — or, more specifically, white Americans — from the existential threat that they claim immigration, immigrants, and now so-called “narco-terrorists” pose to the country. Constructing immigration as an existential threat has provided not only an ideological vehicle for violence, but also a license to subvert and break the law.

By positioning itself as the perpetual victim, the United States government rhetorically renders all its violence as defensive, the violation of human and civil rights as necessary, and every legal constraint as an existential obstacle to national survival. In this way, hijacked victimhood becomes the political and moral engine that normalizes state violence.

Trump 2.0

During a recent cabinet meeting at the White House, Pete Hegseth, who was defending himself against allegations that he had committed war crimes, claimed that the boat strikes were a consequence of the “fog of war,” and the uncertainty that comes with combat. In environmental terms, fog eventually lifts and becomes invisible vapor. In the context of war, when the fog clears, the same thing happens: accountability evaporates, leaving those responsible for violence unscathed and armed with narratives that condone their actions. The “fog of war” is not a plausible explanation for U.S. boat strikes on survivors; rather, what seems central here is the fact that Trump and members of his administration feel emboldened to break the law with the certainty that they will face no consequences.

Trump’s new reign of lawlessness began on January 20, 2025, the day of his second inauguration. Immediately wielding his pen to sanction state violence, he fulfilled his promised anti-immigrant agenda by signing multiple executive orders aiming to significantly restrict birthright citizenship, implement travel bans with enhanced vetting, suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, mandate detention expansion and expanding expedited removal authorities, among others. The executive order titled “Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists” specifically named Tren de Aragua and MS-13 as foreign terrorist organizations. A little over two weeks later, backed by another executive order directing the secretary of defense and the secretary of homeland security to expand migration operations at Guantánamo Bay, Trump sent the first group of migrants to Guantánamo, claiming that they were part of the Tren de Aragua gang.

On December 5, Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the policy of holding migrants at Guantánamo was a violation of their Fifth Amendment due process rights that was decidedly not authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act. While this decision was a victory, the fact that the Trump administration was able to send migrants to Guantánamo at all is a reminder that the law was not enough to stop the violation of rights in the first place — much less dictate any actual consequences after its infraction. That’s also why the Trump administration resumed its Guantánamo operations after the ruling by sending 22 Cubans to the base. The identities of the migrants are still unknown, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refused to disclose any information as to whether or how it might facilitate the individuals’ return to the custody of their government.

In his article titled “Citizen in Exception: Omar Khadr and the Performative Gap in the Law,” author Matt Jones writes about how the law gets manipulated, including through legal subjunctives. Jones describes legal subjunctives as situations where “an actor behaves ‘as if’ their actions were legal even if they are aware that their interpretation will not ultimately be recognized as legal. Though a subjunctive claim of this kind may ultimately be struck down, it may nonetheless hold open a temporary gap in the legal system in which an individual or group is, for a time, deprived of their rights.” Though confidence in the U.S. legal system often rests on the belief that the rule of law will ultimately prevail, this belief exists against the reality that the law is treated as something to be bent, circumvented, or openly violated. But the rule of law simply does not and cannot exist without accountability.

In March, Judge James Boasberg ordered planes carrying migrants to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison to turn around and return to the United States. Disregarding his order, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem instructed the two flights carrying migrants to continue their journey to El Salvador. In November, Judge Boasberg, who had previously argued in April that there were grounds to hold the government in criminal contempt, resumed his inquiry. But even if Noem and the Trump administration are found to be in criminal contempt, we can hardly imagine any administration officials facing any semblance of accountability. Moreover, accountability for perpetrators is only one side of the equation — victim redress is the other. In other countries, this brand of lawlessness would be called corruption plainly (and could be used to justify sanctions or immigration bans), yet in the United States, the facade of legality is maintained through the mere declaration that actions are lawful. In other instances such as the strikes on Venezuela and the kidnapping of Maduro and his wife, the U.S. government attempts to conflate justice and legality — capitalizing on American ignorance — so that they are constructed as being one in the same.

On December 16, Trump issued a presidential proclamation titled “Restricting and Limiting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the Security of the United States.” Adding to Trump’s previous proclamation in June — which banned nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen — the new ban adds Palestine (the ban does not say Palestine or Palestinians, but instead refers to Palestinian Authority documents), Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Syria. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s 2017 travel ban in the case of Trump v. Hawaii, with the majority (5-4) arguing that the president’s ban was based on legitimate national security concerns as opposed to religious discrimination — at least as it pertained to the actual text of the ban and the process of determining the list of countries, not his demonizing and Islamophobic rhetoric. On the heels of his previous win, we can hardly expect the deferential Supreme Court, composed predominantly of Trump loyalists, to stand in his way of accelerating his anti-immigrant agenda and these new set of proclamations banning nationals from countries across the globe — whether rooted in Islamophobia, anti-Blackness, or anti-immigrant sentiment more broadly.

Who Has the Right to Have Rights?

In a postcard dated August 2002 and written to his family, one of the formerly incarcerated Muslim men at Guantánamo, Nizar Sassi, said of the prison: “If you want a definition of this place, you don’t even have the rights to rights.” Of course, what Sassi was describing was a context in which rules and protocols were being constructed specifically to evade the legal norms in place and to render any semblance of rights for those detained nonexistent. As the case of Guantánamo and the ever-expanding post-9/11 national security infrastructure has long revealed, the exercise of human and civil rights is relegated to the whims of those in power, and because they are most often pitted against the rights of the state, the battle for these rights becomes a battle between a canon and a knife — all while the cannon constructs the knife as a threat to its existence.

Trump’s National Security Strategy asserts that “the purpose of the American government is to secure the God-given natural rights of American citizens.” Ironically, this claim rests on a theory of rights that understands them as inherent to human beings rather than granted by the state. Yet the same document justifies empowering government institutions with “fearsome powers” that effectively authorize the suspension and violation of law in the name of protecting those rights. In this formulation, the rule of law is imperiled not only by the state’s abuse of legal authority, but by the explicit authorization to break the law itself.

There is little reason to believe that the legal system will ultimately prevail, as it often fails to — especially in the realm of national security and when it comes to preventing abuses in the first place. We must also remember that Trump did not inherit a clean slate; rather, the administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden demonstrated that the defining continuity of the “war on terror” has been a persistent lack of accountability, whether they committed war crimes or other crimes.

If states like the United States have taught us anything, it’s that they can easily (and often do) disregard the law altogether or weaponize and manipulate the law to protect their own rights at the expense of human rights. Given this reality, how can the state be an adjudicator of our rights when its interest is fundamentally about protecting its own rights at the expense of human rights? Nevertheless, against the state’s insistence that violence is necessary to secure rights and its corresponding refusal of accountability, we must understand our rights to exist beyond and against the nation-state framework. We do not have rights because of the state; we have rights in spite of it. We must also build our collective power to challenge the state so that what controls its ability to govern is the people united in their inherent rights, dignity, and categorical demands for justice for all. Internalizing our rights in this way challenges the legitimacy of the state and its violence, while continuing to build transnational solidarity and a path toward abolitionist futures.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254125982.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:57:30.469901

The event will take place on Saturday, Jan. 10, beginning at 2:30 p.m. The Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Hudson Valley, located at 2021 Albany Post Road, will host the symposium, titled The Real Immigration Crisis: Why It Matters and How You Can Help, featuring Nancy Matsunaga of the CCoHOPE Indivisible Immigration Justice Committee. The focus of the presentation will be to provide a comprehensive overview of the immigration situation in the United States and the ways in which the community can become involved.

The purpose of the presentation is to explain the complexity of migration pathways, legal obstacles, and reforms that aim to protect immigrant residents in New York. Matsunaga will address topics such as the NY4All legislation (protects state immigrant residents, including suspension of deportation in certain cases) and the Dignity Not Detention Act (limits immigrant detention and promotes dignified treatment), initiatives that, according to their sponsors, seek to safeguard basic rights and reduce the impact of detention and deportation policies on immigrant families. The event will combine an informative presentation with a question-and-answer session for attendees.

This community dialogue occurs within a broad and dynamic immigration context. According to estimates from the Pew Research Center, the population of unauthorized immigrants in the United States reached a record 14 million in 2023, including both those who entered without documentation and those who subsequently lost their legal status, representing approximately 4 percent of the total population at that time. By January 2025, the total immigrant population exceeded 53 million. However, changes in immigration policies and increased deportations showed a reduction of more than one million people in the first half of the year.

The backlog of cases in U.S. immigration courts exceeds 3.7 million pending files, according to official data and analysis of the immigration judicial system, reflecting years of delays in decision-making on asylum requests, deportation, and other administrative immigration processes. This figure represents one of the highest levels of accumulated cases in the system’s history, with many applicants waiting years — sometimes more than four — for their case to be resolved by a federal court.

Thus, the symposium will address these aspects and statistics that illustrate a migration flow that has changed over time, but, above all, policies that are constantly adjusted, increasing the urgency to understand not only the data but the human stories behind them. According to organizers, community participation is a fundamental element of the event, which will last approximately one and a half hours.

The event is open to the public but requires advance registration. Those interested in attending must send their name and email address to ccohopeijcrsvp@googlegroups.com. The venue has limited parking, so attendees are advised to arrive early and, if possible, share transportation. For further information about the event, individuals may contact the organizers directly.

Saturday’s presentation will serve as a gateway to understanding the impact of laws and policies, the legal pathways of entry, and the existing barriers, as well as learning how to support immigrant neighbors.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment on inquiries related to the Gold Card to the Commerce Department, which didn’t respond to a request to comment.","President Donald Trump’s recently launched Gold Card initiative has generated interest among foreign nationals, immigration attorneys say, even though many details are uncertain and wealthy applicants face pros and cons in pursuing this path to the United States.

The Trump administration created the Gold Card to allow foreign nationals to purchase legal status in the United States for $1 million, and the portal for applications went online on Dec. 10.

Steven Reingold, a trial attorney with law firm Saul Ewing, said the Green Card substantively appears to be an alternative to the EB-5 visa, which grants foreign investors permanent residency in the United States if they agree to invest high-level capital into a U.S. commercial enterprise that creates or preserves jobs.

One key difference between the two, however, is the Gold Card isn’t a job creation initiative and is essentially a $1 million gift to the United States, while the EB-5 payment requires an $800,000 minimum investment in a U.S. business, although the federal government extracts some of that money for fees.

Rohit Kapuria, a Chicago-based attorney who has worked with clients who have sought EB-5 visas at Saul Ewing, said he expects “some level of competitiveness” between the EB-5 and the Gold Card initiatives but the fate of those funds is one of the key differences.

A foreign national has an opportunity to recoup the EB-5 investment if it was a good bet. “In the Gold Card program, it’s a straight-up gift to the United States,” Kapuria said. “You’re not going to see it again.”

At the same time, Kapuria said, the Gold Card has a provision that looks like “some sort of fast track” that might make that a more attractive option.

Another difference, Kapuria said, is the EB-5 initiative allows for derivative applicants, which means a spouse or children could come in with the same investment, but the Gold Card means $1 million per person.

“So if you have a family of four, that’s $4 million,” Kapuria said. “So that’s a gatekeeping issue, probably for a lot of investors.”

Kapuria said he also expects the Gold Card to pull applicants from the EB-2 visa, which is the vehicle for highly skilled individuals with advanced degrees to enter the United States. The EB-2 program is currently experiencing a backlog from applicants in China and India, he said.

The legal framework for the Gold Card is rooted in existing immigrant categories under the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW visas, which are available for foreign applicants with top skills and advanced degrees and require applicants to demonstrate exceptional abilities that they can contribute to the United States.

George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, said he could envision a scenario in which the judiciary would overturn the Gold Card as unlawful, even though the initiative as launched is based on requirements for EB-2 visas established by statute.

“Is the administration going to be able to convince a federal judge that simply writing a check for a million dollars satisfies the statutory requirements of international claim for your achievements?” Fishman said. “I think that that’s going to be a vulnerability in court in a lawsuit.”

Fishman said a potential plaintiff who would have the legal right to file such a lawsuit is an “open question,” but he speculated that foreign nationals who applied for an EB-2 visa but were unable to immigrate to the United States because of numerical caps would “have standing to sue because they would be negatively impacted personally by this.”

Reingold said the Gold Card initiative has “quite a number of kinks to work out,” including congressional authorization and the regulatory process.

The three-bill package combines the Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bills — a so-called “minibus” funding package covering most federal programs that fund tribal governments, tribal enterprises and treaty-based obligations.
It also preserves funding for tribal public safety and justice programs, including initiatives addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.
Construction and sanitation funding for tribal health facilities is maintained, along with operational funding for existing and newly opened clinics.
“This bipartisan, bicameral package reflects steady progress toward completing FY26 funding responsibly,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)","WASHINGTON — Congress released bill text Monday for a bipartisan, bicameral package of three fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills that would reject nearly $1 billion in proposed cuts to tribal programs sought by the Trump administration, according to congressional negotiators. The package would preserve funding for health care, public safety, education, infrastructure and treaty obligations across Indian Country.

The three-bill package combines the Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bills — a so-called “minibus” funding package covering most federal programs that fund tribal governments, tribal enterprises and treaty-based obligations. The agreement reflects negotiations between House and Senate appropriators from both parties and now moves toward floor votes in both chambers, as congressional leaders work to pass full-year funding ahead of a looming government shutdown deadline.

For tribes, the agreement represents a significant reversal of the administration’s budget request, which would have sharply reduced funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, tribal public safety programs and environmental initiatives. Appropriators instead largely maintained existing funding levels, rejected proposed reductions and fully funded legally required tribal payments that support the day-to-day operation of tribal governments.

In a summary released by Democratic appropriators, the package is described as delivering essential funding to support tribes and treaty obligations, rejecting what they characterized as President Trump’s “push to slash funding” for tribal programs by nearly $1 billion.

Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the legislation would “help ensure Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.”

The Interior bill provides continued support for core tribal government services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including roads, housing improvement, natural resource management and tribal courts. It also preserves funding for tribal public safety and justice programs, including initiatives addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.

One of the important outcomes for tribes is full funding for Tribal Sovereignty Payments, including contract support costs and Section 105(l) lease payments tied to self-determination and self-governance agreements. Those payments, which are required under federal law, have become increasingly important to tribal budgets following recent court rulings.

Indian Health Service funding is also preserved, including advance appropriations that provide tribes and tribal health systems greater budget certainty for staffing, hiring and service delivery, a mechanism first adopted in fiscal 2023. Construction and sanitation funding for tribal health facilities is maintained, along with operational funding for existing and newly opened clinics.

Energy and water provisions continue funding for tribal water rights settlements and infrastructure projects, while the Environmental Protection Agency accounts include support for tribal assistance grants and Alaska Native contaminated lands cleanup programs.

House Republican leaders emphasized the bipartisan nature of the agreement and the return to regular appropriations after reliance on continuing resolutions.

Senate Republicans also emphasized the bipartisan scope of the agreement. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, described the package as fiscally restrained while maintaining core federal investments. “It provides investments in our public lands and upholds our commitments to tribal communities,” Collins said in a statement.

House Republican leaders emphasized the bipartisan nature of the agreement and the return to regular appropriations after reliance on continuing resolutions.

“This bipartisan, bicameral package reflects steady progress toward completing FY26 funding responsibly,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement Monday addressing the FY26 appropriations process and the next set of bills expected to reach the House floor this week. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, said the bills demonstrate how regular order can deliver “critical community projects nationwide.”

If enacted, the package would restore congressional control over tribal funding by reinstating detailed spending directives and preserving advance appropriations and legally required payments the administration had proposed cutting.

Yet for many local families, this moment of togetherness arrived under a heavy shadow. The past year was defined not by holiday cheer but by uncertainty, fear and loss, tempered only by a growing resolve to stand together.

What these past 12 months have revealed for our Latino and immigrant neighbors is not a series of isolated hardships, but the steady force of federal and local policies that have repeatedly and profoundly reshaped daily life in our community. This reality is reflected in a recent study by the Pew Research Center.

The data confirms that the predominant sentiment among Latinos in the United States is one of increasing dissatisfaction and pessimism. More than 5,000 people surveyed by Pew expressed concern about the economy and immigration policy, as well as increasing fear of deportations, discrimination, and violence. Almost nine out of 10 said their daily lives have become more difficult, according to the study.

On the East End, this statistic translates into empty streets, paralyzed businesses, and families living in constant fear.

Throughout 2025, multiple federal operations and arrests were reported in Riverhead, Flanders, Hampton Bays, Westhampton, Greenport, East Hampton, and other Long Island towns. Reports of relatives suddenly disappearing and operations carried out in everyday spaces—bakeries, parking lots, delis, cars and bus stops—have sown panic among workers and families who, in most cases, are essential members of the community, contributing and raising their families in their towns for decades.

And over the past six months, the sense of concern has only worsened as enforcement tactics have become more visible and unpredictable. Masked federal agents in full tactical gear from ICE, ERO, and other agencies have been using public parking lots at local firehouses, Suffolk County Police precincts, Home Depots, a State Police barracks and other public and business locations as makeshift bases of operation, intensifying confusion and mistrust within the community.

Fire departments, local police departments, and state police spokespeople have repeatedly denied involvement in or assistance with any ICE operations, but advocates and members of the local community have raised questions about why and how their parking lots are being used, and what that message sends.

While President Trump claims he is deporting the “ worst of the worst,” the actual data indicates ICE is mostly detaining individuals without any criminal records – not even a pending charge, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, a nonpartisan research center at Syracuse University that provides public access to detailed information on U.S. federal government enforcement, spending, and activities.

As of Sept. 26, about 71.5% of people held in ICE detention had no criminal convictions, according to TRAC.

This is because the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding people. Like those who arrived on America’s shores in the 19th and early 20th centuries — at a time when “legal” immigration meant little more than a brief interview and health check at Ellis Island — they are fleeing poverty, famine, political repression and in some cases, violence or war. The common thread binding our immigrant ancestors to the new immigrants has been and remains seeking the chance to live a better life.

The stark difference is how very difficult or even nearly impossible it is to legally immigrate today from certain regions of the world. The U.S. immigration system has been broken for decades, with very few meaningful attempts to fix it since 1986. In all my reporting, not once have immigrants told me they chose to stay undocumented. There are simply very few paths to come or stay documented, even when they try to do so over and over again.

In the face of the constant threat under which immigrants live in the U.S. today — whether documented or not — a collective voice has also emerged in recent months. People have said, unmistakably, that enough is enough. Community protests, demonstrations, and events of all kinds have taken place throughout the region, signaling a turning point. And this dissatisfaction among the community has not been limited to the streets.

Local organizations, advocates, and community members of all races and backgrounds have launched rapid-response networks, established WhatsApp and Signal groups as preventive and alert measures, launched ICE trackers, held dozens of workshops to inform the community about their human and civil rights, documented federal enforcement activities, held impromptu and scheduled protests, and organized in response to enforcement actions they say lack transparency.

“No one should fear being taken from their home or neighborhood by armed individuals wearing masks who refuse to identify themselves, or be left uncertain about whether those detaining them are acting under lawful authority,” said Anita Boyer, an organizer of several protests across the East End, in a recent interview with Tu Prensa Local at a demonstration in Hampton Bays.

Neighbors, organizations, and community leaders have appealed directly to town boards, demanding explanations, transparency, and protection for immigrant neighbors.

East Hampton Town issued an official statement condemning the actions of masked federal agents, calling the arrests a source of “profound fear and uncertainty” and denouncing “inhuman” policies that undermine human dignity and due process.

The concern has also spread to schools, leading several districts to issue statements on the matter. The Riverhead Central School District was among the first on the East End to send a letter earlier this year reaffirming that schools must remain safe and trusted spaces for all students and that any immigration enforcement actions on school grounds can be carried out only with appropriate legal documentation, in accordance with New York State law.

This climate of persecution has profound and measurable consequences. Businesses have seen their sales drop by as much as 80%, according to local store owners. Professionals and community advocates report an increase in the number of parents requesting custody letters and powers of attorney out of fear of being detained. At the same time, food pantries and community centers are serving fewer immigrant families, not because the need has decreased, but because fear keeps them confined to their homes.

This fear is reinforced by cases like the one recently reported by Newsday, in which a federal judge condemned the treatment of a man detained by ICE in a holding cell in federal district court in Central Islip as “inhuman and unlawful.”

District Court Judge Gary Brown, a Trump appointee, described how the man, Erron Anthony Clarke, spent several days crammed with eight other men in a “putrid and cramped,” freezing-cold holding cell — a room designed to temporarily hold one person for a brief time — under bright lights 24 hours, forced to sleep on the floor around an open toilet in the middle of the cell. The man had entered the U.S. legally under a work visa. “He has no record of violence, drug use or criminal history,” the judge wrote. On Dec. 5, ICE agents arrested and detained him.

The behavior of federal officers during the court proceeding was almost as shocking as the condition of the man’s detention.

Judge Brown wrote that ICE removed Clarke from the Central Islip Courthouse and transported him to a private detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, hours before he was supposed to appear in court, despite an order to produce him for a hearing. He also criticized what he described as false statements and repeated failures to follow court directives.

Other tactics employed by the federal government are just as deceptive. I’ve learned from family members of several men who have been arrested and disappeared, after reporting to an immigration processing office in Hauppauge for a “check-in” or other mandatory appearance required for their pending applications for permanent residence. Upon leaving the office, they were followed, detained and arrested by masked federal agents, and quickly removed to out-of-state detention centers. Their only “crime”? Attempting to follow established procedures on the path to legal residency.

These events confirm that the fear is not exaggerated: it is a logical response to an increasingly visible reality.

The climate of anxiety and uncertainty extends far beyond individual households. The labor of the Latino community sustains agriculture, construction, restaurants, offices, health care, and more.

When an entire group is forced to live under constant threat, trust erodes, and everyone feels the consequences. Businesses struggle to find workers, communities grow more divided, U.S.-born children are left stranded or traumatized after immigration enforcement operations, and the entire local economy weakens.

Still, even among the fear and uncertainty that have defined this past year, something else has also taken hold on the East End.

It can be found in the watchful neighbor, the deli owner who keeps a sign of support on their door, the message sent late at night to warn others to be careful. These gestures do not erase the harm, nor do they pretend that the danger has passed, but they speak to a deeper truth. Communities endure not through force or fear, but through care.

As another year begins, the question that remains is not only how much our community has been affected so far, but, more importantly, what kind of place the East End chooses to be and who it chooses to protect. The decisions made by local leaders, law enforcement and residents will have lasting effects in the years to come.

Will we stand with our immigrant neighbors with compassion and humanity, or will we be indifferent, and in some cases even celebrate their suffering? The choice is in our hands.",https://riverheadlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025_1229_ICE_arrest_E.Main_Riverhead.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 12:57:02.406878

As Republican lawmakers look ahead to the next year of the Trump administration, some have started to appear more comfortable criticizing the president’s most controversial policies, including his administration’s military escalation in Venezuela.

It’s unclear, however, whether the Republican majorities in both chambers are prepared to take the next step and reclaim the full extent of Congress’ authority this year. Several Republicans told NOTUS that they hope so.

“Everyone ought to be cognizant of the job we have, the role and responsibility we have,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick told reporters in December. “You got to represent your districts. You got to defend and protect the institution and Article I. We have a role to play in this government. It’s an important one.”

After last week’s strike in Venezuela, in which U.S. forces went into the country and captured President Nicolás Maduro and Trump declared the U.S. would indefinitely “run” the country, Fitzpatrick was firm.

“The only country that the United States of America should be ‘running’ is the United States of America,” he said in a statement, adding, “We must all place paramount importance on lawful process and constitutional responsibility.”

Fitzpatrick has been a leader in the insurgent fight to claw back legislative power. In July, he was one of just two House Republicans to oppose a $9 billion rescission package that gutted congressionally approved foreign aid and public broadcasting programs. More recently, he co-led a bill to restore federal workers’ bargaining rights that passed the House with 20 Republican votes.

But for the most part, Fitzpatrick’s fights have been lonely or unsuccessful ones. While a smattering of other House Republicans have called for Congress to provide a check on Trump, they haven’t typically aligned on the same set of issues. Their lack of resistance has only emboldened the president.

On the last legislative business day of 2025, for example, Trump declared that the trustee board of the Kennedy Center would rename the iconic performing arts center the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

The decades-old laws that established the Kennedy Center outright ban changing the building’s name. Two Republican lawmakers, Reps. Bob Onder and Mike Simpson, recently introduced laws to change the name in Trump’s honor, apparently acknowledging the role of Congress in the matter. After all, renaming even a post office requires a formal act of Congress.

As with other moves this year, including his rebranding of the Department of Defense as the “Department of War,” Trump did not see fit to seek congressional approval to rename the historic federal building.

When historians assess the first year of Trump’s second term, the Kennedy Center’s name might amount to little more than a footnote in his relationship with Congress. Under Trump’s direction, the executive branch has circumvented the legislative branch’s authority on appropriations, tariffs, war powers and myriad other issues. While some Republican lawmakers have offered objections, for the most part, the GOP-controlled Congress has been a willing partner in its own subordination.

Next Congress, the dynamics might be different, particularly on tariffs.

“We’ve been diminished, and we should be an equal branch,” Rep. Don Bacon told NOTUS in December.

“We should be directing immigration policy, tariff policy, doing a lot more on foreign affairs,” he added. “I mean, the president, the secretary of state works for him, but we have a role in it. So we should be more directive, I believe.”

After the operation in Venezuela, Bacon supported Maduro’s ouster but raised similar concerns with NOTUS about the role of Congress.

“There was little effort by the administration to inform Congress on mission or intentions,” he said. “I don’t condone that. Are we better off with Maduro gone? Yes, but I don’t defend the lack of coordination with Congress.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who frequently bucks the Trump administration, said in a post on X that she was “hopeful” his capture made the world a “safer place,” but she took issue with the lack of congressional authority.

“Late last year, I voted to proceed to debate on two resolutions that would have terminated the escalation of U.S. military operations against Venezuela absent explicit authorization from Congress,” she said. “I took these votes because I believed the administration failed to provide Congress with the information necessary to fully evaluate the legal basis for these escalating actions. That was true then, and it remains true today.”

While it’s unclear how Congress will proceed on the Venezuela matter, the legislative branch may get the opportunity to assert itself on the tariff issue next year. The House voted in September to block challenges to Trump’s global tariffs through March 2026, when Congress will have to vote on the matter again unless the Supreme Court deems the tariffs unlawful.

But Speaker Mike Johnson did not sound eager to stand in Trump’s way during a recent interview with Fox Business.

“I’m a jealous guardian of Article 1 of the Constitution. I mean, the legislative branch is the most important,” Johnson said. “And I’m in charge of that in the House, but I don’t think the president has overstepped his bounds. I think he’s used that tariff authority wisely. And it’s given him leverage in the strategy on these trade agreements. A lot of good has come out of that. I think the court should give deference to the Article 2 branch. And hopefully it continues.”

Congress will also have the chance to pass full-year appropriations bills in 2026. After Elon Musk and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought slashed billions of dollars in federal programs without congressional approval, Republicans only codified a fraction of the cuts.

One senior House appropriator, Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, did try to add a provision blocking the administration’s so-called “pocket rescissions” to a spending bill. The strategy, masterminded by Vought, involves Trump requesting to withhold congressionally approved money. But the request reaches Congress so late in the fiscal year that the legislative branch doesn’t have enough time to act, and the administration considers the money rescinded.

The White House intervened to stop Díaz-Balart, as NOTUS reported, and the provision never saw the light of day.

But appropriators told NOTUS that they believe a complete, Republican-led appropriations process that clearly directs the White House’s spending is the best way to rein in Trump. After all, most of the government is operating off of a budget passed during the Biden administration, making it easy for White House officials to argue they need to take government spending into their own hands.

“If your aim is to put limits on executive power, the best way to do that is to pass appropriations, in my view,” Appropriations Chair Tom Cole told reporters.

It’s not just moderates and appropriators in the conference noticing the amount of authority Congress has handed to the White House.

When NOTUS asked Rep. Darrell Issa, a leadership ally, about the Trump administration releasing an application process for “gold card visas” without congressional involvement, he blamed the House for not taking up H-1B reform, which, he said, allowed the Biden administration to increase revenues and fees without Congress.

“Is it another potential passing of authority from Congress to the other branch by benign or not-so-benign neglect?” Issa asked. “Yes.”

“But who are we to blame but ourselves?” he continued. “If we’d passed our H1-B reform, we’d have not only more revenue, but we would have a clear statement from Congress. But we don’t have that.”

If and when all else fails, some House Republicans have explored another avenue of reclaiming their power — discharge petitions.

Frustrated by GOP leadership refusing to advance legislation that would compel the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, Rep. Thomas Massie offered a petition to force a vote on the floor. Massie’s months-long campaign was successful, and his bill forced the Department of Justice to release hundreds of thousands of documents.

Massie is not alone in deploying the discharge petition strategy. A handful of Republicans have led or signed on to measures ranging from banning congressional stock trading to extending Affordable Care Act tax subsidies.

That model, Massie told NOTUS, could be used similarly to force leadership to push back on the Trump administration.

“Mike Johnson has given the keys to the car to President Trump, but we wrestled the keys back and took them for a spin and got the Epstein Act passed right,” Massie told NOTUS. “There may be more discharge petitions, as long as the speaker keeps things bottled up and just does whatever the president does and keeps everything else from happening.”

And as 2026 begins, more Republican lawmakers sound open to Massie’s ideas.

“It is time for the House in particular to reassert itself when it comes to key policy issues,” Rep. Kevin Kiley told NOTUS.",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNS8xMi8wMW1rLXA0d3gtZDNiZC1ic3Q3LmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 12:12:13.653761

In 2022, nearly 90% of undocumented immigrants were of working age (between 16 and 64 years old), compared to 61.3% of the U.S.-born population.
In addition to the labor market, the U.S. economy is suffering from the drop in income.
Contrary to popular belief, undocumented immigrants do pay taxes.
Lower consumption According to the same source, the purchasing power of undocumented immigrants amounted to nearly $300 billion in 2023.","The anti-immigrant crusade launched by the Trump administration in the first year of his second term has not only caused personal and social hardship: the U.S. economy has also suffered. Labor shortages, the closure of successful businesses, the loss of tax revenue from immigrants, and a drop in consumer spending are some of the consequences economists are warning about, which were already being felt in 2025 and are expected to worsen in 2026. Even the new 1% tax on remittances, which went into effect on January 1, could harm the U.S. economy — a bad omen for someone like Trump, who won the election on the promise of improving the financial situation of his voters.

The most immediate effects of law enforcement operations against migrants were felt in the labor market, where arrests, deportations, and fear of going to work due to raids have led to labor shortages. Edward Flores, associate professor of sociology and director of the labor center at the University of California, Merced, demonstrates in a recent study the relationship between increased operations by federal agents and the decline in employment. He uses as examples California, one of the states with the largest immigrant populations in the country, and Washington, D.C., where last summer Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard to combat a supposed rise in crime that statistics refuted.

In California, private sector employment fell by 2.9% between May and September. There was a recovery in August due to the halt in raids after a judge prohibited racial profiling by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but employment declined again when law enforcement operations resumed in September.

In the District of Columbia, which Flores uses as a reference, private sector employment fell 3.3% through August, but increased 0.5% in September, coinciding with the end of federal control of the local police.

“The effect of stricter immigration controls on the labor market is comparable to that of the Great Recession and the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Flores states. “The continued tightening of immigration controls suggests the need for policy interventions to mitigate the negative economic consequences.”

In addition to deportations and absenteeism due to fear of raids, the United States has lost some of its appeal to foreigners, who fear being targeted by the crackdown. Furthermore, the administration has put up even more barriers to hiring foreigners by eliminating automatic renewals of temporary work permits (EWPs) in October.

More than 100 business leaders went to the Capitol in October to urge members of Congress to take action to prevent their businesses from going bankrupt due to job losses. The American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), a bipartisan coalition of more than 1,700 CEOs, business owners, and trade associations in 17 states, led the group. This was not their first such visit; they have been warning for months about the catastrophic consequences of the administration’s immigration policies. According to the coalition, there are eight million unfilled jobs nationwide, which is “driving up prices across the economy, from food to construction materials, and limiting access to everyday products and services for Americans.”

Agriculture, hospitality, and construction

The impact is not the same across all sectors. Fifty-one percent of dairy workers are immigrants, as are 45% of meatpacking workers and 29% of construction workers. A significant portion of these immigrants are undocumented, the target (at least rhetorically) of the Republican president’s deportations. They represent approximately 5% of the U.S. workforce, a figure that skyrockets in some key sectors such as agriculture (45%), construction (14%), and hospitality (7%). Other service sectors, such as nursing homes, are losing staff and facing labor shortages, which jeopardizes the quality of care they provide to the public.

For the first time in more than 50 years of growth, the migrant worker population is declining. According to the Pew Research Center, in January 2025 there were 53.3 million migrants living in the United States, representing about 16% of the country’s population. By June, the country’s migrant population had decreased by more than one million, to 51.9 million, and this decline has likely continued. This is not good news for a market where the age of the workforce is a factor favoring migrants.

In 2022, nearly 90% of undocumented immigrants were of working age (between 16 and 64 years old), compared to 61.3% of the U.S.-born population. Additionally, an estimated 1.1 million undocumented entrepreneurs in the United States typically open small, local businesses such as gas stations, hair salons, dry cleaners, and grocery stores.

In addition to the labor market, the U.S. economy is suffering from the drop in income. Contrary to popular belief, undocumented immigrants do pay taxes. According to the American Immigration Council, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022. They also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare, programs for which they are not eligible.

“In 40 states, they pay state and local income taxes at a higher rate than almost any other taxpayer, sometimes even more than the top 1% of income earners. This is because they are not eligible for most tax credits, and many of these taxpayers do not claim refunds,” notes a report from the National Immigration Forum, an organization that advocates for immigrants.

Lower consumption

According to the same source, the purchasing power of undocumented immigrants amounted to nearly $300 billion in 2023. Deportations represent a considerable cost to U.S. businesses, as they spend money in the country, buying goods and services and contributing to the economy. Economists have estimated that mass deportations would cause a loss of between 4.2% and 6.8% of the U.S. annual GDP, equivalent to between $1.1 trillion and $1.7 trillion in 2022 values. By comparison, U.S. GDP contracted by 4.3% during the 2007-2009 recession.

GoFundMe to pay for food

The deportation campaign has left many families in dire straits, with the primary breadwinner unable to work or having been deported. The GoFundMe platform has revealed that a growing number of families are turning to this method to seek help covering basic needs. The company, which allows anyone to open an account to raise funds, has seen a 20% increase in donations this year.

Another administration initiative that could backfire is the 1% tax on remittances, which went into effect on January 1 and was included in Trump’s budget bill. Experts believe it could incentivize irregular immigration in receiving countries due to the drop in income sent by relatives from the U.S. Furthermore, migrants sending remittances will have less money available for goods and services, and the tax will encourage sending remittances through informal channels, leaving them vulnerable to fraud.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/EWPQZLBBZZLG5GBZBHEOSFGHH4.jpg?auth=cea0fd54e8ae39777dd13dda5183f041adfc55bc2421a2d0a54ce9478f5d6e00&width=1200,N,,2026-01-05 12:56:57.477193

Regarding birthright citizenship, Frost and Eason’s meticulous archival research now provides them with an opportunity to get on the right side of history.","Chief Justice John Roberts has never had much use for legal scholarship, but a new article about birthright citizenship may well cause him to change his mind. An exhaustive study by two researchers from the University of Virginia significantly undermines the Trump administration’s theory for excluding the children of temporary residents and so-called illegal entrants.

On the first day of his current term, President Trump issued an executive order ostensibly restricting birthright citizenship to children with at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

Cases challenging that order have now reached the Supreme Court, where the justices will have to decide whether to uphold a 129-year-old precedent, conferring citizenship on all children born in the U.S., with only a few extremely narrow exceptions, or to accept Trump’s contention that the parents’ immigration status can deprive their American-born children of citizenship.

Under the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, “All persons born … in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”

In 1897, in Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court noted that the “main purpose” of the provision was to “establish the citizenship” of African Americans, thus overruling the infamous Dred Scott decision. The limitation of the “subject to jurisdiction” clause, the court held, applied only to the children of foreign diplomats and the children of “alien enemies” born during “hostile occupation.”

The Trump administration’s novel argument is that ”jurisdiction” actually means “primary political allegiance,” which excludes “the children of temporary visitors or illegal aliens,” even if they are fully subject to U.S. law.

It seems virtually certain that the three liberal justices will opt for the time-honored view of birthright citizenship, finding no reason to upset the rule established by Wong Kim Ark.

But what of the six conservative justices, who style themselves originalists and seek the Constitution’s meaning in our “history and tradition”? How will they determine the “original public meaning” of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause?

The ratifiers of the 14th Amendment could not have contemplated excluding the children of unlawful entrants, because the concept did not yet exist in 1868. There were no visas or standardized passports, or other official travel documents, and thus no defined legal categories of immigrants. The first general entry restriction — a blatantly racist law that applied only to Asians — was not enacted until 1882.

There were, however, many temporary residents, the other group subject to Trump’s executive order. Naturally, some of them produced children.

As Professor Amanda Frost and her student coauthor, Emily Eason, brilliantly determined, at least a dozen members of Congress in the years 1865 to 1871 may have been the American-born children of temporary residents, whose citizenship would therefore have been “suspect under President Trump’s interpretation” of the 14th Amendment.

And yet, there were no challenges to their qualifications to sit in Congress, for which citizenship is a constitutional requirement.

Borrowing from Sherlock Holmes, Frost and Eason call this an example of a “dog that didn’t bark,” meaning that the absence of expected evidence can render a claim or theory implausible or invalid. In this instance, it cogently suggests that the parental “allegiance” theory of birthright citizenship was not within the original understanding of the 14th Amendment.

To put it another way: If parents’ temporary presence had been a bar to birthright citizenship, why wasn’t that raised regarding any of the dozen or so congressmen who were potentially subject to such a disqualification?

The Supreme Court recently used a similar analysis to interpret the Constitution. The six-justice majority opinion in the 2022 Bruen case, written by arch-originalist Justice Clarence Thomas, cited the absence of certain gun control laws in the early republic to declare a New York gun control statute unconstitutional, because it was not consistent with the “history and tradition” of firearms regulation.

Likewise, the absence of congressional challenges during “the politically fraught Reconstruction era” indicates that there has been no “history and tradition” of considering parents’ immigration status in determining birthright citizenship.

Importantly, both provisions of the Trump executive order — denying citizenship to the children of temporary residents and unlawful entrants — rest on the same legal theory, equating jurisdiction with the parents’ posited political allegiance.

If the theory is wrong regarding the temporary resident provision, it must also be wrong for undocumented entrants.

Roberts and the other conservative justices have previously invoked dubious historical sources to oppose constitutional rights to abortion and same-sex marriage. Regarding birthright citizenship, Frost and Eason’s meticulous archival research now provides them with an opportunity to get on the right side of history.

Trott of Michigan cited Mr. Trump as a factor in his decision to announce his retirement in September 2017.","Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, once a fierce ally of President Trump, is set to depart Congress on Monday as a vocal critic of him and his administration. She used her final weekend in office to lament that Mr. Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela was “what many in MAGA thought they voted to end.”

She is far from the only Republican lawmaker to speak in markedly blunter terms about Mr. Trump just as they were leaving Congress or eyeing the exit.

Lawmakers in both parties, of course, tend to be loath to undercut their leaders; it took a catastrophic debate for top Democrats to turn against former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And some prominent Republican skeptics of Mr. Trump, including Mitt Romney and Jeff Flake, were able to remain in office, at least for a while.

But Mr. Trump’s grip on the Republican Party is so strong that for many of its lawmakers, even mild criticism frequently goes hand in hand with a retirement announcement.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee broke with him over the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, when the president said there were “very fine people on both sides.”

Mr. Corker told reporters that “the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.” Mr. Trump responded by attacking Mr. Corker on Twitter, and the senator announced the next month that he would not run for re-election.

Representative Susan Brooks

The next month, she was one of four Republicans who voted with Democrats on a resolution to condemn Mr. Trump’s social media posts telling four Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the countries they came from. (In fact, three of the four were born in the United States.)

“I voted to condemn the racially offensive remarks the leader of our country made,” Ms. Brooks wrote on Twitter at the time.

Representative Ryan Costello

Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania announced in March 2018 that he would not run for re-election after a court-ordered redraw of a congressional map made his seat much more difficult to defend.

But he was quick to cite Mr. Trump’s style as a reason he felt compelled to leave. “Whether it’s Stormy Daniels, or passing an omnibus spending bill that the president threatens to veto after promising to sign, it’s very difficult to move forward in a constructive way today,” he told a local newspaper.

During his time in Congress, Representative Dave Reichert of Washington, a moderate Republican, was not a particular fan of Mr. Trump.

However, it was not until Mr. Reichert announced his retirement in September 2017 that he unleashed a more scathing criticism. In an interview with Vice days later, he mentioned Mr. Trump’s “Access Hollywood” comments about groping women and said he would have felt compelled to take action if Mr. Trump had made them in Seattle when Mr. Reichert was the sheriff.

“If the statute of limitations was still in existence, and he made those comments in King County, and you know it happened in King County, that’s a person that I would have to arrest,” Mr. Reichert said.

Representative David A. Trott of Michigan cited Mr. Trump as a factor in his decision to announce his retirement in September 2017. That November, speaking more freely without the restraints of a re-election campaign, Mr. Trott told CNBC, “We have different styles and I sometimes don’t understand some of the things he does and says.”

He added, “It’s a very partisan environment and I think that problem has been exacerbated under President Trump.”

Representative Charles W. Dent

The next April, Mr. Dent introduced a bill aiming to protect the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from any attempts by Mr. Trump to remove him as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Days later, Mr. Dent said he would resign early and leave his seat in a matter of weeks, rather than serve out his term.

“The spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle,” Mr. Dent said of Mr. Trump that month. “Disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, intemperate statements are not conservative virtues in my opinion.”

Representative Paul Mitchell

Like Ms. Brooks, Representative Paul Mitchell of Michigan criticized Mr. Trump for his tweets in July 2019 about the four Democratic congresswomen of color. Tagging the president on Twitter, Mr. Mitchell told him “we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders.”

A week later, Mr. Mitchell said he would not run for re-election, telling Politico that the “rhetoric and vitriol” had become overwhelming. In December 2020, he said he was leaving the Republican Party over its refusal to accept Mr. Trump’s election defeat that year. He died of cancer in 2021.

In July 2019, Representative Pete Olson of Texas wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s tweets about the Democratic congresswomen of color were “not reflective of the values of the 1,000,000+ people in Texas 22,” referring to his congressional district.

“I urge our President,” he added, to “immediately disavow his comments.”

Missiles rained down on army bases, airfields and key infrastructure across the capital Caracas and the surrounding region. By 2 a.m., U.S. special forces reached Maduro’s residence and abducted him along with his wife. They were then boarded onto a U.S. warship and flown to the U.S. President Trump posted an image of Maduro bound and blindfolded aboard the USS Iwo Jima. Maduro and his wife were later held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, to face criminal charges of narcoterrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy and weapons offenses. They are now being flown by helicopter to Lower Manhattan to appear in federal court today. Shortly after the operation, President Trump praised U.S. forces for abducting Maduro and his wife, and promised to run Venezuela and seize the country’s oil. Venezuela has the world’s largest reserves of crude oil.

President Donald Trump: “The oil companies are going to go in. They’re going to spend money. They’re going to — we’re going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago. A lot of money is coming out of the ground.”

After the operation, Venezuela’s Supreme Court officially designated the country’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, as interim president. On Saturday, Rodríguez denounced the abduction of Maduro and his wife and vowed that Venezuela was ready to defend itself against the United States.

Vice President Delcy Rodríguez: “We demand the immediate liberation of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores — the only president of Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro. … Everything within the Constitution, we learned it from Commander Chávez in the face of adversities, in the face of coup d’état, in the face of oil sabotages. We are ready to defend Venezuela. We are ready to defend our natural resources that must be for national development.”

Soon after her comments, President Trump issued a warning to Rodríguez, telling The Atlantic, “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” By Sunday, Rodríguez posted a more conciliatory message on Instagram saying that her government is ready to work with the U.S. She wrote, “We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”

Meanwhile, Semafor is reporting that The New York Times and The Washington Post knew of the secret U.S. raid on Venezuela before it was scheduled to begin Friday night, but held off on publishing the story to avoid endangering U.S. troops. A senior Venezuelan official speaking to The New York Times said that at least 80 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in the U.S. attack on Saturday. The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens had been killed, including military and intelligence personnel. This is Jonatan Mallora, whose home was damaged by U.S. airstrikes.

Jonatan Mallora: “I don’t agree with this, no matter what happened, whatever it was. Look at everything that happened there, inside, over on that side, too, and in the back, as well, all of that. We have to be aware. We have to have principles. Now I’m hoping for a quick response from the government to help my family, my children, because they nearly killed my kids here. You know, my kids were almost killed. Up there, there were families, too. Two elderly women died because of these acts that never should have happened, because we aren’t to blame for what happens in this world. They have their problems, and we have ours. Now look at all this chaos. I don’t agree with this, gentlemen.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated President Trump on what he called a “perfect operation” in Venezuela. He spoke Sunday from an Israeli Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Regarding Venezuela, I want to express the entire government’s support for the determined decision and action of the United States to restore freedom and justice to that part of the world, as well. I must say that across Latin America right now we are seeing a transformation in several countries that are returning to the American axis and, not surprisingly, also to a connection with the state of Israel. We welcome this. We congratulate President Trump on his decision. We also salute the American military forces who carried out a perfect operation.”

Netanyahu’s praise for the U.S. assault on Venezuela came as Israeli forces occupying the Gaza Strip shot and killed at least three Palestinians in separate attacks over the weekend. Among the dead were a fisherman and a 15-year-old boy. Their deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza since the October 10 ceasefire was declared to 414, with more than 1,100 injured.

The power has come into force days after the prime minister suffered a blow when new figures showed 41,472 people arrived in the UK on a small boat last year – the second-highest number on record.

On Sunday, the Labour leader announced he had stepped up his bid to ease the crisis – and had ordered the Home Office to close asylum hotels before the current 2029 deadline, although he would not be drawn on a new date.

Officers will begin taking electronic devices from people at Manston processing centre in Kent, to download data they believe will help them gather intelligence on people smugglers.

The new powers for law enforcement agencies are designed to speed up investigations and come after Labour’s new Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December.

Border security minister Alex Norris said: “We promised to restore order and control to our borders which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.

“That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.

“These operational measures sit alongside sweeping reforms to the system, to make it less attractive for migrants to come here illegally and remove and deport people faster.”

Last week, official 2025 figures were 13 per cent higher than the numbers recorded in 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the perilous journey, and 41 per cent higher than 2023's total of 29,437. It was also just 9 per cent below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.

On Sunday, Sir Keir said Britons would start to see ‘evidence’ of asylum hotel closures in the coming months.

Their use was highlighted this summer with a wave of protests centred around the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, after an asylum seeker who had arrived by small boat in the UK was temporarily housed and later charged, jailed and deported for sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl.

The prime minister said he was “determined” to close the hotels but could not give a date when that might happen.

He told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “I’ve said to the system, to the relevant departments, I want to see that brought forward as soon as possible, but no longer the end of parliament. Bring it forward.

“I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you’ll see evidence of that.”

Sir Keir said he did not want to “set a date” until “we’re absolutely sure that we can meet that date”.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused ministers of “cosmetic tweaks” and said there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel, as he reiterated his party’s call for the UK to quit the European Convention on Human Rights.

The government’s new law also introduces new criminal offences, such as up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK via the English Channel smuggling route.

Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could also face up to five years in prison.

At the start of the new year, it is impossible to talk about the Supreme Court in 2025, or begin 2026, without focusing on the justices’ handling of matters concerning the Trump administration. No president in history has challenged constitutional limits or sought to increase presidential power in the way that President Donald Trump has in this term in office.

Not surprisingly, hundreds of lawsuits – 358 up until the end of December – were brought challenging Trump’s actions in 2025, and already some came to the Supreme Court. Never before has the court been asked to rule on the legality of so many presidential actions in such a short period of time.

During the first year of this Trump presidency, the Supreme Court overwhelmingly sided with the Trump administration. The court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in the one case in 2025 decided after briefing and oral argument: Trump v. CASA. The court, in a 6-3 decision, held that federal district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions. Although the court did not declare nationwide injunctions unconstitutional as the solicitor general urged, it held that federal district courts lack the statutory authority to issue such relief. This was a major victory for the Trump administration, and for future presidents, in that it will make it much harder for federal courts to stop unconstitutional or illegal actions, at least through seeking nationwide injunctions.

By my count, based on the SCOTUSblog website, there were at least 24 other rulings in 2025 on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket involving Trump administration actions. Of these, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in 20 and against it four times.

Only one of these 24 emergency docket cases was unanimous: the court’s recent ruling in Margolin v. National Association of Immigration Judges, a challenge to a policy limiting speech by immigration judges. The court did not grant the solicitor general’s request for a stay of the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit’s order, sending the matter back to the district court for additional fact-finding. This was likely the only instance in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito voted against the Trump administration on the emergency docket.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson voted against the Trump administration in every one of the 24 cases. Justice Sonia Sotomayor did so in 22. Only Jackson dissented in Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees, in which the court stayed a district court’s injunction barring the executive branch from formulating and implementing plans to initiate large-scale reductions of the federal workforce. Also, only Jackson voted no in Noem v. National TPS Alliance in May, which involved the Trump administration’s effort to end the Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals.

Justice Elena Kagan voted against the Trump administration in 21 of the cases. She did not join Sotomayor and Jackson in dissent in Noem v. Doe, in which the court stayed a district court’s holding that the Secretary of Homeland Security lacked the authority to revoke the categorical grant of parole to 532,000 non-citizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. In Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., Kagan initially joined Sotomayor and Jackson in dissenting from the court’s decision to stay a district court’s order preventing the deportation of individuals from several countries to South Sudan. But when the matter came back to the Supreme Court a few weeks later, only Sotomayor and Jackson dissented.

The Supreme Court’s many rulings in favor of the Trump administration on the emergency docket have also included orders by the justices that have paused lower court orders stopping the firing of agency officials, ordering the reinstatement of terminated federal grants, keeping the military from excluding transgender individuals, forbidding deportations to South Sudan of individuals lacking any contact with that country, preventing ICE agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion based on certain factors, and keeping the State Department from requiring that passports list the holder’s birth sex rather than gender identity.

There were only three other instances, besides Margolin v. National Association of Immigration Judges, in which the Trump administration lost in the Supreme Court in emergency docket rulings in 2025. In one area – challenges to the termination of federal funding – the Trump administration initially lost, but it subsequently prevailed in two cases on the emergency docket. Notably, this is the one place where Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the liberal justices in dissent.

The Trump administration has cut off billions of dollars of federal funding appropriated by federal statutes. In the initial case to come to the court, Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the court, by a vote of 5-4, turned down the Trump administration’s request to stay a district court order requiring the executive branch to pay nearly $2 billion in reimbursements to nonprofits and businesses that receive federal foreign assistance. Alito wrote a vehement dissent, joined by Thomas, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

A month later, on April 4, in Department of Education v. California, the court, again by a vote of 5-4, stayed a federal district court’s temporary restraining order preventing the termination of $65 million of teacher training grants. In a short, unsigned opinion, the court said that federal grants are like contracts and claims for breach of contract against the federal government must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. The court also expressed concern that the federal government might not be able to recover the funds if it ultimately prevailed in the litigation. Kagan wrote a dissent, as did Jackson, who was joined by Sotomayor. Although Roberts did not join either dissenting opinion, he indicated that he would deny the Trump administration’s application for a stay.

On Aug. 21, the court came to a similar conclusion, by the same margin, in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association. A federal district court found that the termination of grants by the NIH was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-4, stayed this order, again stressing that the matter needed to be filed in the Court of Federal Claims and expressing concern with whether the federal government could later recoup the money.

Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion chastising the district court for not following the court’s ruling in Department of Education v. California. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the pivotal opinion saying that the challenge to the termination of the grants had to go to the Court of Federal Claims, but the challenge to the policy directives to cut off funding could be heard in the federal district court. Jackson wrote a blistering dissent that invoked the cartoon “Calvin and Hobbes”: “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.” Roberts again joined the three liberal justices in dissent, though he did not join Jackson’s opinion.

The two other cases on the emergency docket in which the Trump administration lost were both significant. In A.A.R.P. v. Trump, the court, in an apparent 7-2 vote, stopped the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport individuals from Venezuela to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The Alien Enemies Act allows summary deportations of “natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of [a] hostile nation or government” over the age of 14 who are not naturalized when the United States is in a declared war or faces imminent invasion from that nation. Before 2025, the Act had been invoked only three times in U.S. history: the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. On remand, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the requirements of the Alien Enemies Act have not been met and it cannot be used to deport individuals.

And on Dec. 23, in Trump v. Illinois, the Supreme Court ruled, in a 6-3 vote, that Trump lacked the authority to federalize the National Guard in Illinois. The majority was comprised of Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett, and Jackson. Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment, while Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas, and Gorsuch wrote a separate dissent.

The Supreme Court interpreted two federal statutes in coming to this conclusion. One law, 10 U.S.C. § 12406(3), empowers the president to federalize members of a state’s National Guard if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” The Supreme Court said that this means that a president can federalize a state’s guard only if it can be shown that the armed forces of the United States cannot provide adequate protection.

This, in itself, is obviously a major limit on the ability of the president to federalize National Guard troops. But the Supreme Court went even further. It said that the president could only federalize a state’s guard in a situation in which the U.S. military legally could be used but would be insufficient. This is because the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1385, adopted in 1878, prohibits the United States military from being used for domestic law enforcement except in very limited circumstances, such as when there is an insurrection in a state.

In other words, the Supreme Court said that a president can federalize the National Guard only in the rare circumstances in which the Posse Comitatus Act allows the military to be used for domestic law enforcement and only then if the United States military would be inadequate. The court declared: “[B]efore the President can federalize the Guard under §12406(3), he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be ‘unable’ with those forces to perform that function.”

This is an enormously important ruling, especially because Trump had indicated a desire to deploy the National Guard in cities across the country. It also is important, coming at the end of a year in which Trump prevailed in almost every matter in the Supreme Court, in showing that at least occasionally a majority of the justices will say no.

This year, the court will decide cases on the merits docket about the president’s power to remove agency heads, the legality of Trump’s tariffs, and the constitutionality of his executive order on birthright citizenship. There are sure to be many more matters on the emergency docket and likely others on the merits docket, as well.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1258551194.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:56:54.758995
